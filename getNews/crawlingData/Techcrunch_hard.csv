0,gadgets,"Things aren¡¯t going well down at the ol¡¯ nano-factory. They¡¯re having trouble getting all those tiny workers to synchronize and move quickly together. But leave it to the Germans to get things running smoothly! All it took was a careful application of that newfangled technology ¡°electricity.¡±Tiny nano-scale machines formed from DNA could be the future of manufacturing things at small scale but great volume: drugs, tiny chip components and, of course, more nanomachines. But moving simple, reusable machines like a little arm half a micrometer long is more difficult than at human scale. Wires for signals aren¡¯t possible at that scale, and if you want to move it with a second arm, how do you move that arm?For a while chemical signals have been used; wash a certain solution over a nanobot and it changes its orientation, closes its grasping tip or what have you. But that¡¯s slow and inexact.Researchers at the Technical University of Munich were looking at ways to improve this situation of controlling machines at the molecular scale. They were working with ¡°nano-cranes,¡± which are essentially a custom 400-nanometer strand of DNA sticking up out of a substrate, with a flexible base (literally ? it¡¯s made of unpaired bases) that lets it rotate in any direction. It¡¯s more like a tiny robotic finger, but let¡¯s not split hairs (or base pairs).What Friedrich Simmel and his team found, or rather realized the potential of, was that DNA molecules and therefore these nano-cranes have a negative charge. So theoretically, they should move in response to electric fields. And that¡¯s just what they did.They attached tiny fluorescent pigment molecules to the tips of the cranes so they could see what they were doing in real time, then observed the cranes as the electric field surrounding them was carefully changed.To their great delight, the cranes moved exactly as planned, switching from side to side, spinning in a circle, and so on. These movements are accomplished, the researchers say, at a hundred thousand times the speed they would have been using chemicals.A microscopic image of the nano-crane¡¯s range of motion, with the blue and red indicating selected stop points.¡°We came up with the idea of dropping biochemical nanomachine switching completely in favor of the interactions between DNA structures and electric fields,¡± said Simmel in a TUM news release. ¡°The experiment demonstrated that molecular machines can be moved, and thus also driven electrically¡¦ We can now initiate movements on a millisecond time scale and are thus 100,000 times faster than with previously used biochemical approaches.¡±And because the field provides the energy, this movement can be used to push other molecules around ? though that hasn¡¯t been demonstrated just yet.But it¡¯s not hard to imagine millions of these little machines working in vast (to them) fields, pushing component molecules toward or away from each other in complex processes or rolling products along, ¡°not unlike an assembly line,¡± as Simmel put it.The team¡¯s work, which like most great research seems obvious in retrospect, earned them the coveted cover story in Science."
1,gadgets,"Tile, one of the best known item-tracking gadgets out there, has laid off some 30 people and reportedly stopped the potential hires of another 10, TechCrunch has learned. This comes less than a year after the company raised a $25 million B round last May. The layoffs are reportedly due to disappointing sales over the holidays.When reached for comment, Tile offered the following statement:As part of our 2018 planning process, the Tile leadership team determined that a recalibration of our priorities was necessary so that the company can focus on the development of our Tile Platform business and core hardware products. Unfortunately, this means that we had to say goodbye to roughly 30 Tile colleagues. Tile remains the leader in smart location, and we will continue creating a world where everyone can find everything that matters.The roughly 30 employees being recalibrated weren¡¯t solely from any one area, according to information provided to TechCrunch, so it seems as the company says to be a general cost saving measure. A Tile representative pointed out that a hiring freeze was not announced, so the 10 hires that were reportedly prevented from taking place are still a bit of a question mark.Tile revamped its product line late last summer, improving range and adding two new ¡°Pro¡± units: a sporty one for active types and a fancy white-and-gold ¡°Tile Style.¡± Perhaps it was too little, too late, or perhaps Tile has become too popular for its own good and everyone already has all the Tiles they need.At CES, it announced a handful of new partners that will integrate Tile tech into their products. This is reportedly the new focus of the company ? being a platform-first rather than a hardware-first company. No doubt the devices will still be made and sold, of course, but it won¡¯t be the totality of the Tile offering.Here¡¯s hoping it works and these layoffs are the last we hear of."
2,gadgets,"Learning braille is a skill that, like most, is best learned at an early age by those who need it. But toddlers with vision impairment often have few or no options to do so, leaving them behind their peers academically and socially. The BecDot is a toy created by parents facing that challenge that teaches kids braille in a fun, simple way, and is both robust and affordable.Beth and Jake Lacourse¡¯s daughter Rebecca (that¡¯s her up top playing with the prototype) was born with Usher Syndrome, a common cause of blindness and deafness. After finding existing braille toys and teaching tools either too basic, too complex or too expensive, they decided to take matters into their own hands.Jake happens to have a background in product design, having worked for years at a company that creates simple, durable environmental sensors. But this was a unique challenge ? how to make a toy that doubles as a braille teaching aid? Months later, however, he had created a prototype of a production device, albeit with a one-off 3D-printed case.You can see it in action at the TechCrunch booth at CES here:The BecDot has a colorfully lit surface on which toys equipped with NFC tags (programmed through an app) can be placed. Once the tag is detected, for instance on a toy cow, up to four braille letters appear, formed by lifted pegs: C-O-W. The device also can emit a sound uploaded by the parent or teacher.It¡¯s simple, yes ? as toys should be for kids this age. Yet it affords blind and partially sighted kids the opportunity to learn the alphabet and identify short words at the same time and in much the same way as sighted children. And with the sounds, lights and the possibility of integration with books and lessons, kids will likely find it plenty of fun.Here it¡¯s worth noting that kids with disabilities often suffer doubly, first from simply not having the same senses or mobility as other kids, but secondly from the social isolation that results from not being able to interact with those kids as naturally as they interact with one another. This in turn causes them to fall further behind, isolating them further, and so on in a self-perpetuating cycle. This effect snowballs as time goes on, shrinking kids¡¯ prospects of higher education and employment. We¡¯re talking 70 percent unemployed here.The BecDot and devices like it could help short-circuit that cycle, both allowing kids to connect with others and learn on their own through play.One of the things holding back devices like this is the complexity and cost of braille displays. If you think what¡¯s behind an LCD is complicated, imagine if every pixel needed to actually move up and down independently and withstand frequent handling. The braille equivalents of e-readers can cost thousands to display a sentence or two at a time ? but of course kids don¡¯t need that.Unsatisfied with the available options, Jake decided to engineer his own. He created a simple Scotch yoke mechanism that can control up to three dots at a time, meaning two of them can create a braille letter. It¡¯s all controlled by an Arduino Uno. Simple means cheap, and the other parts are far from expensive; he told me that his bill of materials right now is around $50, and he could probably get it below $30.Such a low cost would make the BecDot highly attractive, I should think, for any school with vision-impaired students. And of course there¡¯s nothing stopping sighted kids from playing with the gadget either, as I¡¯m sure they will.Right now the BecDot is only in prototype phase, but the Lacourses sounded optimistic during CES, when I met with them. They¡¯d been selected for a reward and exhibition by Not Impossible, an organization that creates and advocates for tech in the humanitarian space. Jake tells me their time at the show exceeded his expectations, and that they got a chance to speak with people who can help both move the device toward market and advance the message he and Beth are trying to get out.Toys like this (follow-up devices could have more letters or spaces for input) could help close the literacy and socialization gap that leads to many deaf and blind people being unemployed and dependent on others later in life. And having educational toys aimed at underserved, marginalized and at-risk populations seems obvious in retrospect. It¡¯s a simple idea in some ways, but only made possible by a creative and innovative application of technology and, of course, love."
3,gadgets,"Don¡¯t call Fli Charge wireless charging. Fli Charge is conductive charging. It¡¯s just like plugging something into a wall but uses powered surfaces to distribute power. And thanks to proprietary tech, it¡¯s safe to the touch and just as fast as a wall outlet.The company stopped by TechCrunch¡¯s CES 2018 booth to show off their latest generation. It works and it¡¯s amazing and was able to charge a variety of objects including power tools, smartphones, battery packs, USB-C computers and even a custom laptop with the Fli Charge system built directly in.There are several advantages to Fli Charge. The system is capable of simultaneously charging batteries of different voltages. One strip can charge a smartphone, power tool, and laptop at the same time even though each device has different power requirements.Once a Fli Charge device is placed on the strip, charging starts immediately at the same rate as if it was plugged into an outlet. Four small conductive nubs make contact with the pad and serve up power as needed.The charging pad is safe to the touch and when the pad detects an unknown conductive material like a key or hand, it shuts off immediately. I placed my hand on the surface while it was plugged in and lived. There was no electrical sensation. Throw a set of keys on the pad and the charging shuts off, too.FORM Holdings (then Vringo) acquired Fli Charge, a fledging technology company that once had its technology used in some Chrysler vehicles. Then in October 2016 Fli Charge CEO Cliff Weinstein led a management buyout to take Fli Charge private. Along the way the products were reworked and new partnerships found including with office and school supply provider Bretford and tool maker Craftsman. In both cases, Fli Charge will be built in at an OEM level to select products.The Fli Charge line has expanded since the product hit Indiegogo in August 2017 though the fundamental offering has stayed on target. The company¡¯s pad can charge a variety of gadgets and devices while remaining safe to the touch. Fli Charged received $230k from its Indiegogo campaign.Going forward its clear that Fli Charge sees its future with additional partnerships that builds the Fli Charge technology directly into products like Craftsman power tools. The company sees a future where Fli Charge pads are built into desks and tool cases and laptops, phones and tools charge simultaneously on the same pad. And I, a guy with a lot of laptops, phones and tools, would love to live in the future, too."
4,gadgets,"If you spend any meaningful amount of time in hotels, you¡¯ll know that many of them are still living in the age of the 30-pin adapter, even though most of us have already moved on to Lightning, wireless charging and USB-C. So it¡¯s essential to pack charging equipment to handle any need that might arise ? and usually that means a lot of dongles. Nomad¡¯s new wireless USB hub really cuts down on clutter, and makes it easy to charge what you need to charge, when you need to charge it.The hub looks a bit like a sleek bag burger designed by someone who makes luxury car interiors for a living. It sounds like a weird description, but it¡¯s not a bad thing ? the black puck is basically at home in any decor, so it¡¯s a good bedside companion for home as well as away. On top, the hub has a wireless charging pad with a 7.5W max output (the max supported input the iPhone X, iPhone 8 and 8 Plus can accept).Inside, however, there¡¯s plenty more in the way of charging options, including one USB-C port capable of 3A output, a high-speed 2.4A USB-A port for charging up an iPad or the like and two 1A USB outputs for stuff like AirPods. Each has its own LED indicator (which are faint enough that they won¡¯t disturb even the most sensitive sleeper), and there¡¯s built-in cable management to keep obvious desktop clutter to a minimum.A single 1.2 meter power cable is included and connects to the wall plug to give the hub its combined 30W max output, and rubberized footing gives it a stable stickiness on almost any surface. There¡¯s a matte rubber ring on top, too, which is great for the iPhone X and 8, which can slide gradually off even other non-stick surfaces, even if they¡¯re seemingly lying perfectly flat.In terms of how it works in practice, I used the Nomad Wireless Charging Hub all throughout my recent trip to Las Vegas for the annual CES gigantic crazy consumer tech shitshow and it performed very, very well ? in fact, after a colleague took off with my only Lightning cable, it was the only way I could reliably make sure my iPhone was topped up for the next grueling day of slogging through gadget booths.You can definitely get sleeker, smaller wireless chargers, but at $80, Nomad¡¯s option is only really twice as expensive as a lot of the good options out there, and yet it also packs a lot of additional charging versatility for when you need it. If you¡¯re looking for an all-in-one travel charging companion, this is definitely a top choice."
5,gadgets,"Nintendo¡¯s big new surprise interactive experience for the Switch is now official, and it¡¯s basically a maker kit for the portable console that uses cardboard component pieces to allow people to build a range of different creations and play with them using the console to power games that interact with the DIY components.NintendoLabo is like a next-level LEGO, with kits that let you do things like build working pianos that interact directly with Switch software, and even make your own robots. Nintendo shows off an interactive fishing game with a real, build-it-yourself cardboard fishing rod you can use to catch stuff in-game, and a rolling bot you can remote-control with the Switch¡¯s touchscreen, as just a couple of examples.It actually looks super fun, and there¡¯s a variety kit and a robot kit coming out on April 20, 2018, with pricing starting at $69.99, which seems like a deal for the level of interactivity and creativity that¡¯s available with these things. The Labo kits include all the cardboard pieces you need to build the projects they contain, as well as the Switch software necessary to run the interactive digital elements.Nintendo is also selling Labo customization kits for $10 that will ship at the same time, and provide stencils, stickers and tape that allow you to customize the creations so your cardboard robot backpack looks different from everyone else¡¯s cardboard robot backpack.Kudos to Nintendo for once again ignoring the well-trod ground of putting more silicon and tech behind their gaming console ambitions, and instead striking out into the unknown of the weird and wacky. This looks like a really good time, and one that won¡¯t necessarily result in a huge new source of waste plastic after people move on to the next thing."
6,gadgets,"What do you get when you smush a bunch off live heart cells, specialized biomaterials, and electrodes into a tiny, stingray-shaped package? If you said ¡°lunch¡± than you¡¯re wrong. Instead, you get the first example of bioinspired robotic systems that can imitate nature using both electrical and organic components.The resulting project ? a 10mm long robot that can swim in water ? is ¡°composed of live heart cells, two distinct types of specialized biomaterials for structural support, and flexible electrodes.¡± Created by Ali Khademhosseini at UCLA Bioengineering, the little robot is the first of its kind to contain both biomaterial and electronics.¡°The development of such bioinspired systems could enable future robotics that contain both biological tissues and electronic systems,¡± said Khademhosseini. ¡°This advancement could be used for medical therapies such as personalized tissue patches to strengthen cardiac muscle tissue for heart attack patients.¡±Obviously this little fellow isn¡¯t doing much right now but with a few more moves and some better technology, you can imagine tiny robotic stingrays visiting you at Sea World and/or swimming through your bloodstream."
7,gadgets,"As a hard-core rocker and roller I find that my gear has to be ready to rock and/or roll at a moment¡¯s notice. There is no telling when I¡¯ll have to lay out a face-melter during jury duty or blast out some Stairway while giving plasma at the local blood bank, and I often note to friends that I enjoy rocking and rolling all night and part of every day. Are you in the same rocking boat? Then let¡¯s take a look at the Fusion Guitar.An?Indiegogo darling, this crowdfunded guitar is now shipping and costs $999 in maple and rosewood. The guitar itself has the fretboard of a full-sized electric but a squat hollow body that is full of batteries, a 20-watt amp, and speakers which gives it a sort of lumpen shape. It¡¯s surprisingly dense ? it weighs eight pounds but most of the weight is in the body ? and it runs for six hours on a charge.Like the Yamaha Transacoustic I played a few years ago the trick is that the Fusion contains an amp and speakers, allowing you to turn up the tunes and even run the audio through an iPhone to add audio modeling and record your hot licks. The guitar is compatible with iPhone 7, 7 Plus, 6, 6 Plus, 5/SE and iPhone Touch Gen 5 and an iPhone X shield is coming soon. It has three lines out including a P.A. out, a standard 1/4-inch jack for amps, and a 3.5mm jack for headphones. A small speaker on the top of the guitar acts as a sort of built-in monitor.$999 gets you the guitar, a strap, and a case along with a set of compatible plates. There is no Android compatibility.I am not a great guitarist but I am a gear head, a sad state of affairs which puts me at a loss when reviewing these in depth. The folks at Guitar World created a far more detailed video of the thing but let me offer a few points for the amateur guitarist. This is a solid learning guitar simply because you can run learning apps front and center and plug the thing into headphones to hear the results. It¡¯s also a very fun tool for looping and noodling, allowing you to record and replay various licks and, with the help of tools like Garage Band, record sketches of songs on the fly. I did enjoy my time with the Fusion and found it to be a clever take on the traditional all-in-one guitar. I could definitely see this as a busker¡¯s friend, allowing a guitarist to fill a little more space without the cost or inconvenience of carrying a full amp, and if you¡¯re fast and good enough you could do some real damage with loops and other digital tricks.If I had any complaint it¡¯s that the built-in iPhone dock, while clever, didn¡¯t quite work as well as I¡¯d like. While you can see below that various iPhone apps can make your Fusion experience quite unique I didn¡¯t find the entire system to be very intuitive. I mostly enjoyed the amplification and a bit of distortion from the hum bucking pickups and internal amp and ignored a the apps.I¡¯ve found that guitarists either love or hate gadgets like the Fusion. The familiar, analog sound of a Stratocaster paired with a good amp is always welcome in a music studio but a clever amped guitar like this one is a far harder sell. Like other wacky guitars of the past ? the Fusion reminds me a lot of the Vox Guitar Organ ? playing these are an acquired taste and require a real investment on the part of the player. At $1,000 the Fusion is far too expensive to be a first guitar ? you can get a beginner¡¯s Telecaster for $200 ? and too weird to be a daily driver. If you very specifically need a guitar that can be heard in a crowded hall without outside amplification or if you¡¯re a gadget fiend, the Fusion is for you. Otherwise, a digital Line 6 amp or Roland Go:Mixer and some kind of six-string are all you need to recreate this guitar for less cash but I doubt you¡¯ll get the same self-contained satisfaction that this weird Frankenguitar has to offer."
8,gadgets,"I¡¯ve been going to CES for almost ten years now, and it amazes me that really, nothing has changed that whole time. The same people are saying the same things on the same stages, selling the same people the same junk with slightly higher price tags. But this year I had a great time and found some amazing companies ? because I avoided at all costs actually stepping foot on the show floor.The math is simple: when a company gets big enough to get itself a big booth showing off its products, it is almost always at that point that it ceases to be a source of real innovation ? or at least the kind of innovation I think is worth tracking down and writing about at CES. They don¡¯t do anything truly cool, nor anything truly dumb.And I¡¯m not punishing them for their success. I¡¯ve seen some of these companies grow up from nothing to a flashy booth staffed by dozens, and that¡¯s great. But they exist on a different plane now: they seed their news with sites ahead of time, they have private press conferences, they¡¯re working in suites to set up sweetheart manufacturing deals. They¡¯re part of the machine now. Congratulations!(The most eloquent summary of this side of the show came from a cab driver. After he asked about the latest advances to the TV ecosystem, we explained ? something about OLED versus Micro-LED and refresh rates and other things that make almost no difference. ¡°And is it cheaper or more expensive?¡± he asked with a straight face ? then he cracked a grin and laughed uproariously. He knew the score, and with a single question reduced the whole industry to a pack of charlatans, which is exactly right. That was probably my favorite moment of the entire week.)It¡¯s for this reason that I spent my entire time at CES roaming the hot, shabby wilds that are ¡°Eureka Park.¡±A small portion of the Eureka Park map.Technically it is part of the show, but it¡¯s also like hell. Hundreds of booths perhaps six feet wide and deep are crammed in, CEOs displaying their wares like butchers or street merchants. It¡¯s hot and humid (even in the cold, usually dry Las Vegas January), there¡¯s barely room to move along the inadequate aisles, and if anyone sees you¡¯re media they make a sort of flying pitch at you to pique your interest au volant.Normally I¡¯d hate this kind of thing, but of course I¡¯d do anything for our glorious parent companies. And actually, this is where pretty much everything cool is.Sure, you can find crazy gadgets and knockoffs in the innumerable Chinese manufacturers, and the likes of LG have things like roll-up OLED screens, but these are no more than novelties, both for the companies themselves and those viewing them. The companies at Eureka Park are generally startups with one product or service that they¡¯ve put all their money and time behind; they really care about this stuff.That earnestness is endearing and makes for a good story ? though not necessarily a good idea. I passed by hundreds of booths full of things no one needs and I suspect no one wants, services doomed to languish in obscurity, or devices surfing on a trend that won¡¯t last out the year. (Just how many smartwatches do they think we need?)Every once in a while, though, you hit the trifecta: a smart piece of technology being created for a worthwhile purpose by people who actually care about both. I dare you to find anything like that in any of the main halls.This year I found a few examples of this. The first one I visited was LifeDoor, a device that closes a door it¡¯s attached to when it hears a smoke alarm go off. Here¡¯s something that could save lives (really), is simply yet purposefully designed, and created by a few people (including firefighters) who saw a chance to make something that helped others.Another gadget I found seemed too good to be true, so much so that I requested third party documentation that it works. It was Lishtot¡¯s TestDrop, a device smaller than a keyfob that instantly and reliably tells you if water is drinkable without even touching it. Wouldn¡¯t you be skeptical? This company didn¡¯t really even have its own booth; it was listed under the ¡°Israel Export Institute.¡± An affordable device that could save thousands of lives, and it has less room dedicated to it than Samsung¡¯s cheapest TV!Elsewhere I found Signall (pronounced ¡°sign all¡±), a company using a rather complex camera/Kinect setup to translate sign language in real time. Here¡¯s a tremendously difficult engineering problem, further complicated by it being a language and social problem as well, yet this small company is approaching it slowly and steadily and with the support of the deaf people it hopes to enable. (I¡¯m still working on my writeup of this one.)The passion, if little else, was on display at the SoundSkrit booth.Other stories are less life-changing but equally fun stories. Euveka¡¯s shape-shifting mannequin could help create clothes tailored to body types not catered to by the industry. Soundskrit¡¯s student founders want to reinvent the microphone. And a high school student, tired of her hands freezing while playing lacrosse, worked with her dad to make a heated stick.This is the interesting side of CES, full of people using technology for good or at the very least interesting purposes ? not looking to sell you yet another ¡°smart¡± appliance or scrape the bottom of the funding barrel for one more VR accessory.All of these people came to the Sony press conference and all of them were disappointed.More than a hundred thousand people come to CES, and among those myriads are a precious few who love what they do and want to accomplish something using technology. It isn¡¯t easy and it isn¡¯t glorious (especially not the booths), but it really is worthwhile, and worth seeking out.It¡¯s easy to be cynical about the excess of CES: the pointless press conferences that cost millions, the acres upon acres of TVs nearly indistinguishable from last year¡¯s, the buzzwords and half-truths used to stave off the reality that none of the junk they¡¯re selling matters to them or anyone else. See, I waxed cynical just writing that sentence!But there are treasures waiting to be discovered there, and people waiting to be listened to and learned from. Just don¡¯t look for them in the cavernous main halls and truth-deprived marketing. I can honestly say that CES was well worth going to this year ? as long as you didn¡¯t actually go."
9,gadgets,"You may not think much about the switches that sit underneath the keycaps of your keyboard, but there¡¯s a large contingent of enthusiasts who really, really care. And for those users, Cherry¡¯s various MX-branded switches are somewhat of a standard. Because they include a number of mechanical parts, though, you won¡¯t see a lot of laptop-like thin mechanical keyboards or mechanical keyboards on more than a handful of laptops.The trend, however, is clearly going toward slim keyboards ? and that¡¯s not lost on Cherry. So at CES this week, the company is introducing a completely new line of keyboard switches that may just be small enough to bring mechanical keyboards to more laptops (or at least more niche gaming laptops) and thinner keyboards. These new switches are low-profile versions of the Cherry MX RGB switch, a switch that features colored LEDs and which is especially popular with gamers. The company tells me that, if successful, it¡¯ll launch?thinner versions of its other MX switches, too.As Cherry engineers told me, the company saw a lot of interest in a lower-profile switch. The new one still allows for 3 millimeters of travel, and with a 1 millimeter thin keycap on top of that, you could build a seriously thin mechanical keyboard with these. On thing Cherry definitely didn¡¯t want to change, though, was the ¡°Cherry feeling¡± that many enthusiasts can detect with a single press. At the same time, though, the company also wanted to make sure that it could build a few innovations into these new switches. Among other things, this includes improved spill and dust protection.Cherry says that the switches are rated for at least 50 million key presses (though Cherry told me that it will likely hold up for much longer) and are 35 percent shallower than the standard MX switches. For gamers, the 3.2 millimeter of travel (compared to 4 millimeters in the standard switches) ? and the shorter bounce time that comes with that ? should also allow them to hit those keys just a little bit faster.Cherry is currently ramping up production for the switches, which are all manufactured in Germany. We¡¯ll likely see the first keyboards with them hit the market within the next few months."
10,gadgets,"The Yesojo Nintendo Switch projector dock got a lot of attention when we covered the launch of its crowdfunding campaign last year, but at CES, it was on display and working, with the company ready to ship to its early backers. We got to spend some time with the portable projector, which gives your Switch a high-resolution screen you can take with you anywhere ? and we came away very impressed.The Yesojo is barely larger than the official Nintendo Switch dock itself, and very similar in terms of how the actual dock component works, so there¡¯s no learning curve. It has a 200 lumen digital projector built-in, which is roughly equivalent to around 2,000 lumen with a lamp-powered home unit in terms of brightness. Even in the CES hall lights, it was perfectly playable, and you can imagine how good it would look in dark lighting conditions.Built-in to the projector is a battery with enough capacity to give you around four hours of play time ? and the battery is actually charging up the Switch the whole time it¡¯s in operation, so even when it runs out you can undock the Switch and play for hours more that way.The Yesojo also features a built-in speaker that¡¯s surprisingly powerful and clear in terms of output, and really fills a room ? again, even when competing with ambient conference hall sound.Finally, the Yesojo also has input for other HDMI devices so that you can use it with things beyond the Switch, making it an extremely versatile travel accessory both for work and play.As mentioned, the Yesojo is going to begin shipping soon, and it retails for $369. It¡¯s a great accessory for the Switch, and a good deal for a portable projector that works with all your devices, and that also ships with a USB-C adapter in the box. The dock itself can charge easily using the original Switch adapter, too, so you only need one cable.It sounded like it was potentially too good to be true when the project was first announced, but now that we¡¯ve had some time with it, it lives up to its potential ? and more. We¡¯re going to be putting it through its paces for a full, extended review soon, but based on what we saw at CES, this will be a very in-demand add-on for Switch fans."
11,gadgets,"One in six Americans now own a smart speaker, according to new research out this week from NPR and Edison Research ? a figure that¡¯s up 128 percent from January, 2017. Amazon¡¯s Echo speakers are still in the lead, the report says, as 11 percent now own an Amazon Alexa device compared with 4 percent who own a Google Home product.Today, 16 percent of Americans own a smart speaker, or around 39 million people.The holiday shopping season also seemed to have played a role in the increased adoption of smart devices in the U.S., with 7 percent of Americans reporting they acquired at least one smart speaker between Black Friday and the end of December, and 4 percent saying they acquired their first smart speaker during the holidays.Both Amazon and Google used the holiday shopping season to their advantage in terms of acquiring market share for their respective devices by slashing prices to encourage more impulse buys, and by heavily promoting the items across their storefronts. In fact, analysts believe that both Amazon and Google likely lost a few dollars per unit during the holiday season, where they were discounting their smaller form factor devices to $29 for the Amazon Echo Dot and $50 for the Google Home Mini, for example.The end result for Amazon was that the Echo Dot became a top seller across its site and by manufacturers through the Black Friday weekend, and through the holidays, Amazon recently said.The new report also delved into how consumers are using their devices, which have a range of functions including things like being able to stream music, control their TV and other smart home devices, and more.The research indicated that smart home functionality was in the minds of 64 percent of users, who say they bought the speakers because they plan on using them to control smart home devices.66 percent said they want to entertain family and friends with the speakers ? for example, by doing things like playing music, asking general questions, telling jokes, playing games, getting news and weather or sports scores, and more.Bringing a new, interactive device into the home may also be changing user behavior in other ways, the report found.30 percent of smart speaker owner said the device is replacing time spent with TV. They¡¯re also listening to more audio (71% are), including news and talk radio or podcasts.?The adoption of the device for in-home voice assistance had a trickle-down effect as well, as 44 percent found they started using the voice assistance on their phone more since getting a smart speaker.This, perhaps, could push Amazon to add Alexa itself to the Alexa companion app where today users are able to manage various settings, and check in on conversations. (In fact, it seems that Amazon is already considering this. When we asked Alexa VP Steve Rabuchin about the plan during CES this week, he smiled and cagily responded, ¡°that¡¯s an interesting idea.¡±)The research also indicates that smart speaker usage grows the longer you have the device.A majority (51%) said they use their smart speaker more often than they did the first month they had it, while 33 percent they use it about the same amount.The full report is available here or as a PDF."

This year, however, Mercedes-Benz had one of the most interesting announcements at the show with its new MBUX smart multimedia system and in-car voice activated assistant.MBUX is not the underpowered, underwhelming voice input system carmakers have been pushing on consumers for around a decade now. Instead, it¡¯s a learning, smart and connected platform built upon Nvidia¡¯s powerful GPU technology. For maybe the first time, using an in-car infotainment system felt to me like an actual pleasure, rather than doing something that ranges from ¡®bad¡¯ to ¡®adequate¡¯ on the user experience scale.Part of that is just the fact that the computers powering the system are capable enough to drive high framerate visuals, on screens with a high resolution that doesn¡¯t leave things pixelated. For too long, infotainment systems in cars have relied on underpowered, cheap local chips to power their output, leaving software developers working at automakers with the unenviable challenge of shoehorning their work onto silicon that really shouldn¡¯t be running an alarm clock, let alone vital apps and information displays you use while driving.Scrolling and animations on the MBUX system¡¯s two dash mounted displays (one in the center, and another behind the steering wheel) are silky smooth, and feel as responsive as an iPhone to touch input, which is a major achievement relative to typical first-party car touchscreen performance.MBUX also focuses on simplicity when it comes to interaction: Even though it offers a lot of options and features, many of the things you want to do can be accessed directly from the top level main screen, including navigating to your home, playing a favorite music station, checking the weather and more.Even when you do want to drill down to be more specific, there are shortcuts built in, thanks to the way MBUX learns your preferences and presents them through a ¡°Suggestions¡± shortcut that¡¯s just a tap away form the main screen. These will offer suggested destinations, music, cabin comfort settings and more based on what it learns about your habits, your schedule, and your preferences. They also follow the driver around, and are attached to their profile ? which can even follow you from vehicle to vehicle if you¡¯re switching between Mercedes cars equipped with MBUX.Of course, there¡¯s also the voice powered element, which you can trigger by saying ¡°Hey Mercedes¡± at any time, or by pressing a button on the steering wheel. This allows you to issue voice commands in natural language, like saying ¡°I¡¯m cold¡± in order to have it increase the heat by two degrees, or asking it if you can wear flip flops next week to retrieve a local weather forecast.In practice, the voice commands worked well, though Las Vegas cellular service wasn¡¯t always cooperating. Mercedes-Benz built its speech assistant with occasional connectivity in mind, however, so there¡¯s a lot you can do even when you¡¯re not connected to the cloud, including modifying cabin lighting and asking it to play specific songs from an attached USB drive, for instance.Its capabilities are also designed to grow over time; the smart assistant is built using AI technology powered by Nvidia, and can improve both locally, and via software and feature updates pushed from the cloud. Mercedes-Benz also plans to issue significant feature additions to the system over the lifetime of the vehicle, and using Nvidia GPUs to power it mean they¡¯ve actually got a lot of additional computing power to spare to support those updates.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang explained in an interview that his company has been working with Daimler directly for two years to bring this to fruition, with a dedicated engineering team set up for the purpose. Daimler VP of Digital Vehicle & Mobility Sajjad Khan also added that working with Nvidia was key to helping the company achieve something that was performant now, but also had plenty of room to grow.In the end, MBUX is that rarest of beasts: A first-party infotainment system that¡¯s exciting, powerful and extremely well-crafted from a technology perspective. If you¡¯d have told me a week ago that one of my favorite things from CES would be an automaker¡¯s infotainment software, I¡¯d have laughed, but here we are.MBUX will arrive first on the all-new A-Class when it arrives later this year, but it will also roll out to other new Mercedes vehicles after that."
13,gadgets,"CES, the yearly bacchanal of tech and innovation, has outgrown its shell. Las Vegas has been home to the event since the late 1970s and, for better or worse, the city has survived and served the influx of technologists who flock to the event each year to see the latest and greatest. But two things are happening simultaneously that make Las Vegas the last place to find innovation.First, Vegas infrastructure, while seemingly resilient to massive influxes of conference-goers, is having trouble keeping up with CES. Massive crowds in the many halls were greeted by multiple power outages ? an ironic scene for a tech event. Million-dollar booths ended up in the dark and a Google booth flooded as rain came into event halls ill-prepared for actual weather. The shuttle system simply can¡¯t keep up with the crush of people and the anemic monorail ? an affront to public transit ? is useless during the daytime rush. Add in multiple massive venues and a taxi system that can¡¯t handle the crush of countless non-locals trying to get from point A to point Z and you¡¯ve got a mess.Second, the reason for big shows like CES is changing. Why does everyone need to be in one place when most business is done electronically, even algorithmically. While it¡¯s nice to spend a week in a casino, perhaps it¡¯s time for a smaller, more focused show or no show it all?Perhaps, in the end, it¡¯s time to move CES to a modern city?While I have no specific answer as to where to send conference-goers ? Denver? San Francisco? LA? Dubai? Berlin? ? perhaps the real answer is for Las Vegas to fix its very real and very difficult transport, electrical and data problems so innovation can thrive in this strange desert oasis. As it stands, the city that wants to play host to thousands of technologists isn¡¯t very technological, and its amenities ? aimed more at bachelorette parties than LAN parties ? are insufficient and even dangerously lacking.Perhaps the next big event will not be physical. After all, the reason for having a yearly tech festival has changed. CES used to be forward-looking: products that launched there in January appeared on shelves months later. The current model is flipped: the coolest stuff launches online a year before and is shown in the flesh at CES. Crowdfunded projects that finished in April appear at CES in January as a sort of coming-out party. But do people really care anymore? Crowdfunders care about shipping product, not about spending thousands on a booth in a hostile city.A lot has to change to make CES amazing again. Perhaps it¡¯s too late. But Las Vegas does the world no favors and actively harms its image when it can¡¯t keep up with the future."
14,gadgets,"Consistent access to clean water is something billions lack, and part of that is the inability to check whether one¡¯s water is clean or not. Lishtot could help change this with a tiny device that instantly determines if water is safe to drink just by analyzing the electric field around it ? no strips, no microfluidics, no toxic chemicals. It honestly sounds too good to be true, but as far as I can tell it¡¯s the real thing.I talked with Lishtot (Hebrew for ¡°drink¡±) CEO Netanel Raisch at CES, where he demonstrated the simplicity and effectiveness of the TestDrop device. He had with him two plastic cups of water, to one of which had been added a contaminant. Pressing the test button, he moved the TestDrop toward one cup ? blue light, clean. Do the same for the other ? red light, contaminated.It¡¯s that simple to operate; I did it myself successfully after one or two tries. It¡¯s so simple, in fact, that I was suspicious. I thought it might be some kind of spectroscopy, but where was the emitter? Why did you have to move it, if not to create some kind of doppler effect?Turns out that the whole thing is based on the electromagnetic fields that surround everything. Water creates its own local field, which is measured by moving the TestDrop through it, and it turns out that clean water emits a slightly different field than water with lead or chlorine in it, water with E. coli, water with dissolved animal matter and so on.The device has been subjected to third-party testing, two reports from which I read; the thing really works. It detected even tiny amounts of lead and protein instantly and with 100 percent accuracy and no false positives or negatives.The replaceable watch battery should last for years even if you¡¯re using the device 10 or 20 times a day. Several of these known readings are built-in (it¡¯s calibrated around half a plastic cup of water, as the plastic doesn¡¯t interfere with the fields) and the TestDrop doesn¡¯t need to check its data against the cloud in order to give a drink/don¡¯t drink response.If, however, you do want to bring in the smartphone and app part, there¡¯s a service that Lishtot is running that tracks tests done with its devices, if users choose to submit them. Raisch hopes this will become a useful database both for ordinary users (who can find clean water sources if necessary) and governments or companies (who can tap in and watch for trends). You¡¯ll be able to report problems directly to the utility, as well.Lishtot has more water purity-related technology on the way, but for now the TestDrop is its main product. The devices cost $50 each, or $35 with the CES discount ? but my guess is they¡¯re more likely to spread when bought in bulk by NGOs, utilities and other organizations, which will then distribute them where they¡¯re most needed."
15,gadgets,"Peak Design announced its line of bags on Kickstarter in 2016. It¡¯s my favorite thing at CES 2018. The project raised $6.5 million on Kickstarter and now the company has a full product line designed for photographers and bloggers and people who just like nice things. That¡¯s me.To be clear this is not a new bag. The bag has been out for a bit but I purchased Peak Design¡¯s Everyday Backpack a day before CES started.Buying a new bag before CES was a bold move. I¡¯m not a bold guy. Tackling CES with a new bag is a potential disaster. In the past I¡¯ve used a North Face everyday carry backpack for CES. I travel with the bag and it¡¯s been to four continents and logged hundred of thousands of air miles over the last few years. That bag is my mobile office. I know exactly where everything is. But the bag also isn¡¯t the best for carrying cameras and its large size means I overpack it. I needed something different and I¡¯m pleased with the Peak Design Everyday Backpack.I bought this bag without seeing it first. The sheer amount of positive reviews made the bag seem like a winner and they¡¯re right. This bag gets everything right.Confident design. That¡¯s the best way to describe the Everyday Backpack. It¡¯s smart and solid. The bag¡¯s fabric is dense and feels incapable of being snagged or ripped yet it¡¯s still soft enough to be pleasant to the touch. There¡¯s one main pocket and several zippered sections around the bag including a laptop sleeve.The main section is secured with a novel latch. It¡¯s amazing. Made out of metal, it grabs onto one of four bars to secure the top. There¡¯s a long magnetic strip behind the bars that grabs the metal latch and holds it tight until the latch grabs the first available bar. In practice it¡¯s smooth and satisfying. It just works.The bag¡¯s layout makes it perfect to carry cameras or drones or whatever. The inside of the bag is one large cavity that¡¯s separated by sturdy dividers that can be configured in several different ways. There are large zippers on both sides of the bag that gives access to the interior compartment. This lets the wearer swing the bag off one shoulder, unzip a side and grab a camera.Camera bags have had similar dividers for decades. But it¡¯s the origami nature of these dividers that make them among the best available. The dividers have several bendable points that allows the user to configure the bag without the need of extra, smaller dividers. I love it. This design made easy work of a Canon 6D, a kit, telephoto and macro ? something that I couldn¡¯t do well in my North Face bag. I had one divider running parallel with the bottom to hold the camera. Then on top of the camera, I placed one divider vertically, creating two spots to hold the two lenses.I¡¯m not going to run through all the details of this bag. A few more are worth calling out: The sternum strap is fantastic. It uses clips without moving parts so it should last a lifetime. The shoulder straps are attached to the bag with a rivet that allows the straps to swivel as needed ? it¡¯s a smart advancement in the design of a backpack. And inside the laptop sleeve is a small pocket that is absolutely perfect to hold a Traveler¡¯s Notebook and a pen.The Peak Design Everyday Backpack is a fantastic bag. Seriously. It¡¯s capable of holding an array of cameras and lens without extra bulk. And it looks great doing it too.The Everyday Bag is a bit costly with an average price just under $300. The cost is the only downside I see. Similar bags from Tenba, Incase and countless others can be had for half the price of the Everyday Bag. It¡¯s hard to justify the price but I after using the bag for several days, I can confidently say it¡¯s a fantastic product and I¡¯m happy with my purchase. This bag is the best thing I saw at CES 2018 even though it¡¯s not new. I¡¯m in love."
16,gadgets,"The Switch is getting a bevy of new games that should appeal to a broad variety of players, Nintendo announced today in one of its ¡°Direct¡± videos. A new Mario Tennis game, updates to Odyssey, some classics and indies and, perhaps most unexpectedly, Dark Souls: Remastered.The deepest fan-pleaser cut has to be The World Ends With You, a quirky DS cult hit with a great soundtrack and great modern aesthetic. Many a fan has asked for a remake or port, and they are surely crying tears of delight today.The impeccable Super Mario Odyssey gets a new competitive game mode and an appearance by the well-known plumber¡¯s too frequently ignored brother. Luigi hosts Balloon World, where you¡¯re given 30 seconds to hide a balloon somewhere on a stage, or find one that someone else has hidden. No doubt 999-star power players will find ways to put these in absurdly hard to reach areas.Luigi also appears (alongside all the usual suspects) in the new Mario Tennis Aces, which is pretty much what you¡¯d expect. The story mode looks like it¡¯ll be fun, though I doubt it will touch the fondly remembered Power Tour on GBA. (If you want a spiritual sequel to that, try Golf Story. Wrong sport, right feel.)I personally am looking forward to playing action JPRG Ys VIII, the beautiful and musical Fe and mega-hard pixelly platformer Celeste, which has been given a few easier modes for people who don¡¯t want bite marks on their controllers.While I¡¯ll probably end up replaying Dark Souls: Remastered on PC to get the maximum effect of the redone art, it¡¯s nice to know that Nintendo is looking to court games and developers generally preferred by more hardcore types.Check out the rest of the Nintendo announcements (with groan-worthy narrated clips) at the Direct page."
17,gadgets,"It¡¯s 2018,?so it¡¯s high time pillows gain a bit of technology. Rem-Fit¡¯s Zeeq pillow is packed with the goods to, hopefully, improve a person¡¯s sleep in various ways. Some people need music to fall asleep while others need help with snoring and analyzing sleep patterns.The pillow comes in three different flavors. The snore pillow features a vibration feature that gently encourages the sleeper to change position to hopefully reduce snoring. The tunes pillow has the ability to play music from a connected smartphone through eight speakers placed throughout the pillow. The company says only the user will hear the music. The tracker pillow is loaded with sensors and uses analytics to give sleepers insights into patterns, which offers users suggestions into improving sleep.It seems the Chicago-based firm thought through a lot of these features. The sleep function has a timer on it so Frank Ocean won¡¯t play the whole night. There is even an alarm built into the pillow that will wake the sleeper. The pillows also work with IFTTT, Alexa and Google HealthKit in various ways.The engineers behind the Zeeq stopped by TechCrunch¡¯s CES 2018 booth to talk about their pillow. I didn¡¯t get a chance to try it out, though I really needed a nap. The guys point to the Zeeq¡¯s Kickstarter success as affirmation of their product. They say the community on the site helped them hone the feature set into the final product.There are downsides here. The pillow needs to be recharged every two weeks. The pillow also needs to be connected to a Wifi network, which is something I never thought was going to be a thing.The pillows are available now and cost $200 during the current sale."
18,gadgets,"Now that the Meltdown and Spectre cats are out of the bag and patches are being issued left and right, the main question people have is: will this affect my everyday work? Intel¡¯s latest performance metrics suggest that yes it might, but not too much ? more so if, like me, you have an older processor.Intel¡¯s Navin Shenoy released the results of several benchmarks done internally, and the performance hit from the deeply rooted processor problem disclosed by Google researchers is mercifully small for modern chips.The most recent Kaby Lake processors, introduced late last year, generally see less than 5 percent performance loss in SYSmark14SE, and often none at all. (The margin of error is stated at +/- 3 percent.)But the biggest hit for those CPUs, and in fact most of the others as well, is on ¡°responsiveness,¡± which according to the benchmark app¡¯s creators includes ¡°application launches, file launches, web browsing with multiple tabs, multi-tasking, file copying, photo manipulation, file encryption + compression, and background application installation.¡± So, pretty much all the stuff most people need to do.Gaming performance seems mostly unaffected, and with most GPUs affected in a more limited way or not at all by the exploits and their mitigations, gamers can probably rest easy.It¡¯s those with older processors that may see a real slowdown ? for example, the sixth-gen Core i7 6700K released in mid-2015. Its performance losses tip toward the 10 percent level, with responsiveness dropping 31 percent on Windows 10. Naturally, that¡¯s my exact setup ? and likely the setup of many a user who bought these extremely popular chips back then.This chart shared by Intel shows the raw numbers, as percentage of a chip¡¯s unpatched performance.Chart attack!Older setups are possibly even more deeply affected, but we can wait for the results. The real risk with those chips is that they are in embedded or hard to reach systems that are difficult to patch, leaving them open to exploitation. So far there have been no reports of hackers taking advantage of any of these bugs, though ? it¡¯s not exactly script kiddie stuff.Strangely, in a few cases there are performance gains, though who knows how that came about. Shenoy doesn¡¯t address this unexpected windfall, small as it may be.So if you notice your computer going slower in the next couple weeks, it¡¯s not just you, and it isn¡¯t a conspiracy by Apple ? unfortunately, it¡¯s a necessary consequence of the fix for Meltdown."
19,gadgets,"Boeing just revealed a prototype drone capable of carrying much more than a camera. The company tasked engineers with designing and building a cargo drone and the prototype they came up with is able to haul 500 lbs of goods.The vehicle is huge and much larger than anything DJI sells. It weighs 747 pounds and is 15 feet long, 18 feet wide and 4 feet tall. Four arms hold two props each. It took Boeing engineers three months to design and construct the prototype, which just completed a test run in Boeing¡¯s research lab in Missouri.¡°This flying cargo air vehicle represents another major step in our Boeing eVTOL strategy,¡± said Boeing chief technology officer Greg Hyslop in a statement. ¡°We have an opportunity to really change air travel and transport, and we¡¯ll look back on this day as a major step in that journey.¡±The company did not release official flight capabilities including range or speed. Those will come in time and chances are this vehicle will never be produced but used as a testbed for technologies that will lead to cargo and vehicle drones."
20,gadgets,"LiveMap launched in TechCrunch¡¯s Hardware Battlefield CES 2014 and is getting closer to producing its augmented reality helmet. Since launching, the product has evolved to a working prototype. I tried it on at CES and it seemed to work fine.The current version of helmet features a small transparent screen mounted on the visor. A small projector is mounted in the chin of the helmet. The software projects directions, maps and notifications onto the screen, but in the final version it will be directly onto the visor, the company said.Andrew Artishchev the founder of LiveMap told TechCrunch at CES 2018 his company has enough runway to certify the helmet for use in America and enter production. He insists that his company has the proper design and management to get LiveMap certified and on the market. LiveMap is targeting a US launch.¡°We are pleased to be still in business due to perseverant testing, development, retesting,¡± Artishchev said, adding, ¡± and a thorough understanding experience of all the problems and challenges involved in designing and constructing a complex, innovative product capable of operating in such variable and potentially hostile environments.¡±LiveMap is not the only company trying to produce an augmented reality helmet. Others like Skully and BMW have examples but have yet to have one hit the market."
21,gadgets,"When PicoBrew announced its PicoStill, a $249 distilling add-on to its Pico C brewing system, I was nonplussed. How could you produce good whiskey or gin in a compact system? Well you can. Since then I¡¯ve tried PicoBrew¡¯s beer system and was very impressed ? and now, after a solid taste of the PicoStill¡¯s gin, I¡¯m a convert.The $549 PicoBrew is a Keurig for beer. You purchase a self-contained pod of ingredients that fits inside the PicoBrew¡¯s brewing belly. Then you fill another tank with distilled water and the PicoBrew boils, brews and flavors your beer. I made a few beers and both were very nice. The PicoStill adds another wrinkle to the process by pulling out the alcohol using a low heat distillation system.Interestingly, the PicoStill can separate out the heads and tails of the distillation process automatically, ensuring you get only the tastiest part of the distillation. This also means the PicoStill keeps you safe and headache free, as many of the problems with home distilling involve capturing the wrong chemicals like acetone, acetate and acetaldehyde. A separate chamber drains off the nastier parts of the brew.¡°By developing technology that automatically separates the methanol from the heads, we have significantly reduced the dangers inherent in distilling spirits,¡± said CEO Dr. Bill Mitchell. ¡°The PicoStill provides commercial distillers a versatile, safe, and easy to use small batch distilling solution.¡±So how does it taste? Two of our intrepid reporters tried a gin made with the still and pronounced it tasty and drinkable. Our own Matt Burns called it ¡°delightful¡± and smooth with gentle floral notes reminiscent of Bombay Sapphire. While it won¡¯t have all the polish of a bottled spirit, you can definitely have fun turning wine, beer and other mashes into a tasty tipple or oil essences and, in the end, that¡¯s all that matters."
22,gadgets," Everyone needs a robotic friend and the Loomo might be the best yet. Part pack mule, part Segway, part voice assistant, the Loomo packs a lot of goods into its self-balancing frame.The device is from Segway Robotics, which is backed by Intel and Xiaomi. Intel¡¯s RealSense provides sensors to make it safe to use indoors and out and the Segway platform lets it self-balance and travel at up to 11 mph.The device is loaded with features to the point where it seems the company is having a hard time defining the target market. The company says object and activity recognition lets it be the ideal security device. The cargo carrying and follow capability lets it be a robotic companion. Either way, even without a clear target market, it¡¯s a solid device.Segway Robotics stopped by TechCrunch¡¯s CES 2018 booth for a quick demo. The robot easily performed as advertised and carried my bag for me. And as a Segway, it worked well, too, able to scoot people around the show floor.But without a clear sales message it will be hard to sell the device when it hits the market in early 2018."
23,gadgets,"Voice control is everywhere these days, but to hear people effectively from every direction, devices like Amazon¡¯s Echo need to have a whole collection of microphones in them ? but they take up space, require extra processing power and restrict industrial design. Soundskrit is a brand new company that aims to replace those many mics with a single one that can clearly hear and separate sound from multiple sources and directions.The Soundskrit device easily tracked two separate voices speaking from different directions simultaneously, quickly providing independent recordings and transcripts of each one; you can see a video demo here. It could just as easily ignore one voice in order to hear another better, or focus on accepting sound from a single direction, such as in front of a camera.I¡¯m sure you can imagine half a dozen situations off the top of your head where such a capability might be useful: smart home devices, video recording, meetings and conference calls¡¦ anywhere you or a device wants to hear one sound but not another.This can already be done, of course, but it¡¯s done in a rather clumsy way, by taking the signals from multiple microphones and applying algorithms to sort out the noise, compare waveforms to determine which is stronger whereas to get an idea of direction and so on. It¡¯s complex and ends up reducing the quality of the recorded sound, especially in the lower registers.The design of the company¡¯s prototype microphone was inspired by insects, many of which have highly acute ¡°hearing¡± that¡¯s accomplished by sensing the way air moves across tiny hairs or other pressure-sensitive structures.Soundskrit¡¯s tech does a similar thing with a special membrane on a custom chip. Sound enters from all sides and, based on how it vibrates the membrane, its origin can be determined with a pretty decent accuracy. And it does it without compromising the quality or tone of the sound.Research on this topic goes back many years, but these students decided to make a go of turning it into a product after encountering it in their studies. They¡¯ve raised an $800,000 (Canadian) seed round from TandemLaunch, a Montreal-based incubator that focuses on commercializing research.For now the team is just getting started and the device is far from being in a state that could be included in a real product. But once it¡¯s miniaturized, tested and so on, it¡¯s a fair bet that companies like Google and Amazon, with their focus on accurate voice recognition, will be sniffing around the tech."

26,gadgets,"Some ideas you hear and they immediately make sense. Some take a minute, but the more you think about them, the better they seem. Euveka, a mannequin for clothing designers that can change shape and size in seconds, is the latter ? and I think it may eventually be a standard item in any fashion studio and a fair few other industries.It¡¯s not something I ever really thought about, but designers don¡¯t just create one version of a shirt or jacket and then scale it up and down (well, good ones don¡¯t). They need to design and refit it for different body types, allowing for the many shapes humans take and the ways that shape changes with time or activity.That means lots and lots of mannequins. Big, small, short, tall, pregnant, broad-shouldered, narrow-hipped and everything else. It would be nice to just be able to dial in the exact size and shape you¡¯re designing for, right?That¡¯s Euveka. Under the standard soft, pin-friendly cover (stretchable, naturally) is a set of mechanisms that can change all kinds of measurements, quickly and (ahem) seamlessly.Pretty much any combination of measurements can be put in, mirroring the diversity of human morphology.Shoulders, bust, chest, waist, hips, thighs and height can be independently adjusted, as well as general, shall we say, robustity ? allowing for the realistic replication of body types from a 5¡Ç pregnant woman to a 6¡¯3¡È basketball player.The changes happen over a few tens of seconds, and yet so slowly that you may not even be able to tell when it¡¯s growing, shrinking or otherwise reconfiguring. It¡¯s all done with an attached application that also warns of unsafe pressures or chemicals if they¡¯re detected.I spoke with Audrey-Laure Bergenthal, president and CEO of Euveka, at CES. She and the others on the team helped expand my mind a bit as to what something like this enables.¡°There¡¯s fashion, of course,¡± she said. ¡°But also medical, sports, security ? any time there¡¯s a question of morphology. At the #cesunveiled of #lasvegas ! ?? ?Join us on January 9th to 12th on booth #50011 #eurekapark #sandsexpo ! #bestofinnovation #awards #ces #ces2018 #technology #innovation #fashionA post shared by  EuVeKa (@euveka_smartmorphosizing) on Jan 7, 2018 at 7:55pm PSTShe gestured to some gentlemen who had just left the booth. They, she said, were from the French Ministry of the Army. ¡°Soldiers have a certain type of morphology,¡± she said.Testing with those actual types could make better uniforms, sure. But she also pointed out that women¡¯s upper bodies differ more broadly than men¡¯s in the military, making bulletproof vests significantly less effective. Tailoring those vests to more body types could literally save lives.In sports, of course different body types are to be found in different sports, but the bodies also change over time and different bodies change in different ways. Why not have uniforms ready for players before and after spring training?This transition took about 30 seconds.Again, people in different phases and conditions of life deserve to have well-fitted clothes: older people who have bent forward over time, or people in wheelchairs who have adopted new postures or whose bodies have adapted to a recumbent position.You could get a different mannequin for each of those bodies and the dozens more you might want over time, or you could get a Euveka.The most obvious downside is that while a Euveka mannequin can replace dozens, it can only be used for one garment at a time ? five traditional mannequins, of course, could wear five, and be worked on by five designers.Bergenthal said that a Euveka is, realistically, as effective as having 10 mannequins in use by five people. That will differ designer by designer, of course. And there¡¯s no reason you can¡¯t have both.Well, except the price. This thing ain¡¯t cheap. You can lease one for ¢æ3,000 per month, or buy one outright for ¢æ96,000. That may explain why their early partners are major fashion houses like Chanel and Louis Vuitton. The army, too, may get in on the fun, assuming the French military is anywhere near as deep-pocketed as our own.Work is just beginning on the Euveka line, however: R&D is ongoing, Bergenthal told me, both to improve the existing model and to add new parts and shapes. A male mannequin with similar capabilities is underway, as well as arms, lower legs, feet and different postures and spine curves.Designing for more bodies seems like it should result in better clothes and a healthier industry, not to mention happier consumers. The first Euveka mannequins should be shipping in March."

Over the course of the last few years, the company has built a voice assistant and an ecosystem of hardware partners that, for the most part, cater to the Chinese market. At CES this week, the company talked a bit more about its own first-party smart speaker: the oddly compelling Raven H, which looks nothing like what you imagine a smart speaker would look like. In addition, though, it also showed off the popIn Aladdin, a dome light with a built-in projector that the company specifically designed for the small apartment you find in countries like Japan.Baidu developed the light/projector together with smart projector maker XGIMI and Baidu Japan¡¯s popIn brand. It¡¯s kind of ingenious when you think about. In a small room, you may not have the necessary space for a projector and speaker, but with the Aladdin, you get both, plus a voice-enabled smart speaker that hangs from your ceiling.The Raven H, too, is similarly unusual in that it looks like a stack of LEGO bricks, but with a thin, removable top that functions as a standalone voice assistant with a touch-enabled, highly low-res screen on top.That removable display also fits on the even odder Raven R, which is a robot with an articulated arm that can dance to your music and, the company told me, locate you in space and always aim its microphone in your direction as you move around the room. There seems to be more to this, but the Raven R isn¡¯t quite ready for prime time yet and won¡¯t go on sale until later this year.Together with its partner Little Fish, Baidu also brought an Echo Show-like smart display to CES, as well as a smart lamp from Sengled.As Kun Jing, the general manager of Baidu¡¯s Duer business unit told me, the company is looking to Japan for its first major international expansion of DuerOS because it already optimized its assistant for the acoustics of small rooms. It doesn¡¯t look like Baidu is planning to bring its software and hardware to the U.S. anytime soon, though. Jing argued that this isn¡¯t so much a question of language support as that Baidu doesn¡¯t think its products will work well in large American homes."
28,gadgets,"Lacrosse is a physically demanding sport under the best conditions, but inclement weather adds frozen hands to the mix. Samantha Wolfe had enough of it and, as a 14-year-old freshman, thought, ¡°why not make a heated stick?¡± Three years later, her idea has become a reality ? the FingerFire lacrosse stick ? and is being tested right now by teams in colder climes.Wolfe goes to school in New York, and explained the rather self-evident problem when I visited her booth at CES.¡°It gets so cold that even with gloves, your fingers get numb,¡± she said. She told her dad (who was also at the booth) at the time, why don¡¯t they make sticks that warm your hands? It would sure make the games a lot more bearable.Seems logical. But searching found no such thing, and eventually the Wolfes decided to take matters into their own hands, so to speak. They worked with a product design house Enventys Partners to do the engineering and prototyping, and it ended up being a two-year process to make the thing.¡°It took us about ten months just to test different heating methodologies and looking at the tradeoffs among weight, heat and duration,¡± Wolfe explained, writing on the FingerFire site.All self-funded, of course. VC firms don¡¯t take a lot of meetings from high school kids.Eventually they arrived at the current version, which keeps two hand-size sections of the stick at a steady 100 degrees F for an hour and a half before needing a recharge via USB. It¡¯s been tested for durability and safety (can¡¯t have sticks blowing up mid-game) and for the ideal temperature (earlier versions weren¡¯t hot enough).I tried it and, while it wasn¡¯t exactly comfortable in the heat and crush of CES, I can definitely say I wouldn¡¯t mind having it if I were playing in freezing temperatures.Now the stick is set for testing this season by Division I teams at the University of Maryland, Syracuse and Johns Hopkins. (Don¡¯t worry, there¡¯s no rule against it ? the US Lacrosse governing body approves.)The goal is to get a manufacturing partner or sponsor, perhaps via word of mouth once champion teams see the utility of having a heated stick. Currently each team will have four to test, but a set of a dozen or two wouldn¡¯t be too hard for a sponsor like Adidas or Under Armour to swing.It¡¯s an inspiring story to see someone pursuing a dream of invention like this from such an early age, especially a young woman, of which there is far too small a number in the worlds of engineering and hardware startups.¡°My passion is for all girls to feel that when they are playing lacrosse they have the fire and confidence in them to play their best,¡± writes Wolfe. On the field and off!"
29,gadgets,"It turns out that in case of a fire in your home, a closed door is the best barrier against spreading smoke, heat and flames. But who¡¯s going to run around the house shutting doors? LifeDoor is a simple gadget that sits on your doors¡¯ hinges and closes them automatically (and gently) when smoke is detected. It¡¯s kid safe and firefighter approved.I talked with LifeDoor¡¯s Ben Docksteader and Joel Sellinger on the show floor at CES, where they¡¯re showing off the latest prototype of their self-designed home safety device.It was inspired by knowledge widespread among firefighters but less known among ordinary folks that deaths from smoke inhalation, toxic and superheated gases and heat are effectively mitigated just by closing a door. UL has been trying to spread the word over the last few months following some studies showing the effectiveness of this simple countermeasure.(If nothing else, it¡¯s worth taking away from this post that closing the door is a good idea in case of fire.)LifeDoor is quite simple, really: The device, about the size of a paperback (now ? future versions will be smaller), is installed in seconds by dropping it into the hinge of any ordinary door and attaching it to the door itself with screws or double-sided tape.The gadget is primed by opening the door, which works as normal, and then waits until it hears the distinctive, standardized 85 decibel tone of a triggered smoke alarm. If that happens, it pushes the door closed. It also lights up the room and sends out its own alarm in case someone didn¡¯t hear the first one.It¡¯s such a practical idea that Docksteader¡¯s business partner, himself a firefighter in the Pacific Northwest, thought he could just go out and buy one ? but instead found no such product exists, or at least not one that ordinary humans could install easily in their homes. So he and the team decided to make it.They¡¯re totally self-funded, Docksteader said: ¡°We called in every favor we could. Our biggest contributor was actually other firefighters.¡± They¡¯re hoping to raise more money in the near future to cover manufacturing costs, but the design is nearly finalized and as far as I could tell from the demo, it worked like a charm.The team is well aware of the obvious worries. Could it slam on a kid or hand and hurt them? ¡°We do tests where we put our fingers in the door ? makes sense we should be the ones to take the risk,¡± Docksteader said. It has to be hard enough to close the door but no harder than that.Could a kid get trapped in a room when the door closes on them? The door doesn¡¯t really take any more effort to open than normal, so any kid that can open it in the first place can get out, and any kid that can¡¯t will be safer in an enclosed space.The battery should last 18-24 months if you¡¯re testing your smoke detector regularly (which would of course shut all the doors equipped with the device), and they¡¯re working on improving that.They¡¯re also planning on Z-Wave smart home integration, which could in the future help provide other information, such as whether anyone¡¯s in the room, where the fire started and so on.The plan is to ship in the fall, and pre-orders will open soon. As always with pre-orders, use your own discretion, but to me a handful of these would be a no-brainer if I owned a house. Sellinger told me firefighters love it, which is about all the recommendation you need. If you¡¯re interested, you can get half off using CES2018 as a promo code ? and no, they didn¡¯t pay me to say that. If something as simple as closing a door could save a life and a fortune, I¡¯m behind a gadget that does it for you."

31,gadgets,"Consumers are starting to give Alexa¡¯s voice apps, called skills, more of their attention. During CES this week ? where Amazon is battling for attention with Google Assistant across the consumer technology spectrum on display here ? the company detailed a few new numbers related to skill adoption and new ways they¡¯re helping consumers find skills they¡¯d like.While Amazon a few days ago noted in a blog post that Alexa now has more than 30,000 skills available worldwide, it hasn¡¯t shared much in terms of whether the skills are actually seeing much use.The company still isn¡¯t sharing hard numbers related to skill installs, or day-to-day usage, but it is offering at least a tiny peek under the curtain.According to numbers shared by vice president of Alexa Voice Services and Alexa Skills at Amazon Steve?Rabuchin at CES, Amazon last year launched over 100 tools and features aimed at skill developers, and skill usage is now on the rise as a result of the improvements in developer technology.Specifically, skill engagement has increased by 50 percent year-over-year, and it¡¯s up nearly 75 percent since last January.Now, Amazon is focusing on making sure the ecosystem rewards skill developers for their efforts, while better exposing skills to end users, as well.The company has paid out ¡°millions¡± to developers in 22 countries, including the U.S., the U.K. and Germany, since the launch of the rewards program in May, which pays top skill developers for building engaging skills.It also added in-skill purchases and subscriptions.Amazon last fall rolled out new ways to help consumers find those skills, too. For example, Alexa learned how to suggest skills to Echo owners when they asked a question that the assistant itself couldn¡¯t do. (Yes: ¡°there¡¯s a skill for that.¡±)¡°When you ask for something, even if you don¡¯t know there¡¯s a skill there, we try to match that skill to your request so you¡¯re not left with an unfilled request,¡± Rabuchin said. ¡°Over time, you shouldn¡¯t have to think about the skill, or know how to use it, you should just be able to talk to Alexa.¡±In more recent days, Amazon expanded its ability to recommend skills even further.¡°There¡¯s certain games when you finish the game, we will suggest another game,¡± he said. ¡°So far, it¡¯s been relatively well-received by customers¡¦it¡¯s no different than when you¡¯re on Amazon shopping ? you¡¯re looking at a camera, and [the site informs you] people who liked this camera also looked at these other cameras,¡± Rabuchin added.Skills, of course, aren¡¯t Alexa¡¯s only capabilities. At CES, Amazon is pushing its way into the smart home space, too.Heading into CES, there are more than 50 third-party Alexa-enabled devices available to customers, with many more coming, and there are?more than 4,000 smart home devices that can be controlled with Alexa, from more than 1,200 unique brands, Amazon also told us.Customers have connected tens of millions of smart home products, as well."

But that hasn¡¯t stopped other entrants from trying their hand, or wrist, in the space.Most recently, Kate Spade New York has introduced a new line of smart watches in collaboration with Fossil. This is part of a larger push by Fossil Group to launch smart watches across as many brands as possible, as announced in August.The Kate Spade models were announced today at CES, and all share the same name: the Kate Spade New York Scallop Touchscreen Smartwatch. It just rolls off the tongue, right?All of the watches are powered by Android Wear 2.0 and have 1.2-inch, circular OLED displays as well as an ambient light sensor. Styles include a rose gold watch case with a bracelet, a rose gold watch case with a leather strap, and a yellow gold colored watch case with a black strap. That said, all three models are made of stainless steal.The Kate Spade scallop, a distinctive feature across a number of Kate Spade products from bags to clothing to iPhone cases, is featured on the face of the watch.But this isn¡¯t just an aesthetic play. The new models will come with exclusive watch faces, including an NYC taxi speeding off and an eyelash blink if you have a new notification.The watches also come with an app that asks you what color you¡¯re wearing and automatically changes the watch face color to match your outfit. As expected with Android Wear 2.0, the new Kate Spade watches are equipped with a microphone to let you chat it up with Google Assistant.On the other hand, these are not built for fitness junkies, with no heart-rate sensor or built-in GPS. Also missing is an NFC chip for mobile payments.These new models start at $295, with the bracelet version going for $325, and the watches should ship in mid-February."
33,gadgets,"The wireless charging movement is getting one more boost today, this time from the world of gaming. Razer, the tech giant that has built a brand (and very loyal following) as a gaming-first hardware company, is announcing HyperFlux, a new wireless power technology that will be making its first appearance a new mouse, the Razer Mamba HyperFlux, and a corresponding power mat.Priced at $249.99 (¢æ279.99) the mouse and matt will be launched in Q1 of this year.The decision to opt for a mouse is interesting for a couple of reasons. The first is that the mouse is the product with which Razer ? which went public last year in Hong Kong, and now has a market cap of around $4.7 billion ? first made its name several years ago.The second is that the reason it was Razer¡¯s first big peripheral, and remains a key item, is because of its central role for gamers. I¡¯m guessing that if adoption of it takes off ? along with a general growth of wireless charging overall ? we might see Razer adding more products into the mix.While Razer is not known for making entirely new products that no one has ever seen before, what it¡¯s generally very good at is building and optimizing typical hardware in a way that makes it especially useful and appealing to gaming enthusiasts (and in particular those who are already Razer fans).That is the case with the HyperFlux, too. Razer said it has built it using a magnetic field to transfer power to the mouse in real-time, rather than charging a battery, as many other wireless architectures are built today (for example for phones). This means that the mouse is lighter, and moves faster, making it especially good for gaming.Razer claims the wireless charging sans-battery is a world-first.¡°While other companies have attempted to do wireless charging for mice, they have been unable to achieve true wireless power as their mice still need a battery to be charged. HyperFlux Wireless Power Technology is a game changer in the world of wireless gaming,¡± said Min-Liang Tan, Razer co-founder and CEO. ¡°Gamers are no longer held at the mercy of a battery or cable. Instead, there will be true wireless freedom with a cordless gaming mouse that¡¯s the same weight as a wired mouse.¡±Announced during CES in Las Vegas, the new HyperFlux-equipped mouse also uses Razer¡¯s Adaptive Frequency Technology for its signal strength, which Razer says is more stable. Other features include a 16,000 dots-per-inch (DPI) 5G optical sensor for finer movements. The mat, meanwhile, is two-sided to allow for faster (hard side) or finer, slower (cloth side) movements. It¡¯s also equipped with Razer¡¯s now ubiquitous Chroma lighting for colour effects that match the rest of Razer¡¯s kit.Razer also uses the show to show off concept ideas that may or may not ever make it to the market but are interesting to consider as reference ideas where Razer is playing with themes that it might eventually use elsewhere.This year it¡¯s showing off something called Project Linda, which is a laptop with a built-in cradle for the Razer phone in place of a mousepad (the Razer phone being the new device launched last year after Razer acquired Robin-maker Nextbit). The cradle charges the device, uses it as a touch-pad for the laptop and presents it as an extension of the screen. The idea might appeal to those who are all-Razer in their hardware choices, and would be an obvious way for Razer to lock more people into their ecosystem.It¡¯s also showing off a new line of speakers that it is calling Nommo, specifically Razer Nommo and the higher-end Razer Nommo Pro.Unlike the rest of what we seem to be seeing today, these are not ¡°smart¡± speakers that respond to your voice commands, but are instead focused on sound quality that is optimised for the gaming experience.In the case of the Nommo Pro is a?THX Certified, 2.1 speaker system with Dolby Virtual Speaker ¡°technology for gaming immersion¡± that will sell for $499.99/¢æ579.99. The Razer Nommo? is the more moderately priced alternative at $99.99/¢æ109.99, and a second version featuring Razer¡¯s Chroma lighting at $149.99/¢æ169.99.¡°We created the Razer Nommo line as an ultimate entertainment speaker line for gaming, movies and music,¡± says Min-Liang Tan, Razer co-founder and CEO. ¡°There is a common perception that gaming speakers don¡¯t have quality audio. The Razer Nommo line changes that once and for all.¡±The speakers are coming on the market this month."
34,gadgets,"August Home, the smart lock startup that was acquired by lock giant Assa Abloy in October last year, is stepping up its delivery game. At CES today, the company announced a service it¡¯s calling August Access, where retailers can work with August and its partner Deliv to open your front door and bring packages directly into your home when you are not there, if you use a smart lock from August, Emtek or Yale (two other Assa Abloy brands).The service ? launching first in the US ? is getting a new branding today, and a new platform open for business, but it is not completely new: it¡¯s an extension of a service August first announced with Walmart in September, just weeks before its acquisition.August Access may sound familiar for another reason: it was the name of August¡¯s partner platform that it launched back in 2015?when it first started to play around with the idea of trusted providers that might be allowed into your home without you answering the door.It seems that the deal with Walmart and August¡¯s own acquisition have created a catalyst for the idea, though. ¡°We have been working on this for some time with a variety of retailers and testing it,¡± said?Jason Johnson, the co-founder and CEO of August, in an interview. ¡°It¡¯s now coming along very fast.¡±The advantage of partnering with Deliv is that it will give August a potential funnel of partners that it can pitch to expand the kinds of delivery services it is already using Deliv to fulfil. The UPS-backed startup says it?has a footprint roughly the size of Amazon Prime Now¡¯s next-day service, works with some 4,000 retailers that cover not just big retailers like Best Buy and Macy¡¯s, but also online businesses like BloomThat and Plated.¡°Through this unique partnership, we are bringing a bit of magic to the shopping experience,¡± said Daphne Carmeli, CEO of Deliv, in a statement. ¡°Deliv provides the last mile fulfilment solution for a broad retailer network across the country while August Home supplies the technology to take the final step into the home for a totally seamless experience, start to finish.¡±August says that August Access will appear as another delivery option in cases where a merchant is participating in the program, and those who have the required smart lock on their doors can select it. When they do, August generates a one-time passcode for the Deliv courier. When the courier rings the customer¡¯s doorbell, a notification gets sent to the August app, and if you are not physically there to let the courier in, the code gets used to drop off the package.Johnson admitted that he gets a lot of questions about the trust issue involved with this service: are people really ready to allow others they don¡¯t know into their house to drop off parcels when they are not home?While August has been running its trials with Walmart, it¡¯s also been carrying out some market research to see how people in general feel about the idea. The results are not a resounding ¡°YES!¡±, but they¡¯re not completely discouraging, either.¡°We now have data that tells us that about one-third of Americans, when presented with this, are more or less strong in their reaction to say no,¡± he said. ¡°But it¡¯s not, ¡®Absolutely not, I¡¯ll never do this¡¯. Some may not be open to it and that¡¯s fine, but we found that one-third [of respondents] are excited about it. Maybe they have had packages stolen or are already giving access to dog walkers or others and are comfortable with the idea.¡±Interestingly, Johnson believes that the proportion who are more wary could potentially be won over because of a gradual shift we¡¯ve seen not just in more smart home gadgetry adoption, but in a bigger take-up of other services in the sharing economy. ¡°We have to prove to them that this works,¡± he said. ¡°Think about other things we share now that we wouldn¡¯t have before, think about Airbnb. You need validation from friends.¡±And for those who need more than a good word, August is also offering a camera feature to watch the delivery live or play it back later.One other reason why retailers might be keen to try this out, and users might start demanding such a service, is because the giant retailing elephant in the room.Amazon has also been rolling out an in-home delivery option, by way of two new products in its connected home strategy, a home camera service called?Cloud Cam and Key, Amazon¡¯s smart lock initiative. The idea here is that Amazon delivery people can use the two in tandem in cases where a customer has opted for in-home delivery, both to access your home and to record the event to give you peace of mind.Amazon¡¯s service was announced just a week after August was acquired by Assa Abloy, and a month after its trial with Walmart began. But although they may all compete, there may be opportunities for collaboration, too.¡°We applaud what Amazon is doing, and we think the Key program is pretty cool if you want to buy 100% of what you want from Amazon,¡± Johnson said with his tongue in his cheek only a little. ¡°But we believe people like choice and flexibility. So we want to provide our system in an open way that could potentially also include Amazon, if you are comfortable giving Amazon access.¡±Indeed the Deliv relationship is key to August Access today, but it¡¯s not exclusive and potentially leaves many regions (including the rest of the world outside the US) untouched, leaving the door open for more partnerships.¡°August maintains a relationship with Amazon as well, and we hope to share news on us working on delivery as well with them,¡± Johnson said."
35,gadgets,"Libratone has been around for almost ten years, but for the longest time, the company was mostly known for its Bluetooth speakers. With the launch of the Pixel 2, Google chose Libratone as one of its first ¡°Made for Google¡± headset partners, which gave the company¡¯s headset lineup a bit of a boost. Now, at CES, the company is launching its latest headset, the?Libratone?TRACK+ Wireless In-Ear.There¡¯s obviously nothing new about wireless in-ear headsets (you can get one that¡¯s good enough for many people for under $30 these days). What¡¯s interesting here is that Libratone is building adaptive adjustable noise cancelling into this pair.Libratone¡¯s other noise cancelling headsets already give you the option to switch between four noise cancelling levels, depending on your environment. The TRACK+ earphones will automatically do this for you. With that, Libratone is following in the footsteps of Beats, which also recently announced its Studio 3 over-ear headsets with a similar feature.In my experience with the company¡¯s Q Adapt on-ear headset, Libratone¡¯s noise cancellation works well enough, though at its higher settings, there is a hiss that¡¯s significantly more noticeable than what I¡¯m used to from my Bose headset. On the other hand, though, you¡¯re not really going to notice that when you¡¯re in the kind of noisy environment where you want to use that setting.The new headsets will come in two colors: ¡°stormy black¡± and ¡°cloudy white.¡±?They will start retailing at Amazon and other retailers for $199 in early 2018."

In addition to monitoring your sleep, the device can help you trigger actions using IFTTT when you get in and out of bed.Withings already had a sleep-focused device called the Withings Aura. It was a package with both a sleep sensor and a bedside unit with an alarm and a speaker. Nokia is dropping the bedside unit and the price tag of its new device.The new sensor works using Wi-Fi instead of Bluetooth LE and is going to ship at some point during the first quarter of 2018 for $100.After putting the device under your mattress, you can look at your sleep cycles in the Nokia Health Mate app, such as light sleep, deep sleep and rapid-eye-movements phases. The Nokia Sleep can also track your snoring.But the best feature is that the device works with IFTTT. You can pair the Nokia Sleep with other devices in case you¡¯re really into automation. For instance, when you get out of bed in the morning, the Nokia Sleep could tell IFTTT to switch on the lights, raise the temperature, open the blinds and more.In addition to this new device, Nokia is shipping an update to the Nokia Health Mate app. It now integrates with Alexa, which means that you can ask your Amazon Echo about your sleep or your weight.

A scaled-down version of that system now works indoors, Intel says, making it perfect for conferences, Vegas shows and bar mitzvahs.These drones opened Intel¡¯s CES keynote. A dozen or so took the stage and danced above a projected piano, playing a tune reminiscent of Tom Hanks¡¯ performance in Big.Intel isn¡¯t saying what advancements were made to bring the drone show indoors. This platform in late 2016 and I got a behind-the-scene look at the system prior to its first show at Disney World. It¡¯s impressive.One person controls the army of drones thanks to a sophisticated control platform that pre-plans the route of each drone. At that time Intel engineers told me that the system can control an unlimited amount of drones. In the version I saw, the drones used GPS to stay in place and the drones lacked any collision detection sensors.Called the Shooting Star Mini (the outdoor version is called Shooting Star), this system uses a different type of location detection system when GPS is unavailable.How much does it cost to rent an indoor Intel drone show? Intel didn¡¯t release a price list but I¡¯m sure it¡¯s not inexpensive."
38,gadgets,"As drones increase in availability, more organizations and governments are looking for ways to protect assets from nefarious drones. Fortem has developed a system called DroneHunter that, well, hunts drones. Literally. DroneHunter involves detecting and then removing drones by shooting them down or capturing them with another drone. This is dogfighting with drones.The system uses radar to monitor a designated area and identify potential bad actors. Once a target is identified, a large six rotor drone is deployed that can be equipped with several different takedown devices. This drone then intercepts the rogue drone and shoots a net at the target drone to either cause the drone to crash or tether it to the larger drone. Fortem says this system works with drones traveling up to 100 miles per hour.As we explained last year, Fortem acquired its core radar technology in 2016 from IMSAR, and over the last year has adapted it so that the system can be exported around the world, leased or purchased outright within the typical security budget for a variety of venues, and can work with any security-grade drones.The Utah-based startup raised $5.5 million last year to bring this product to market.This system is now available for purchase at an unnamed cost from Fortem though it seems sales will be limited to defense and federal government customers."
39,gadgets,"For the longest time, we¡¯ve been waiting for Google to bring its Assistant to devices with a screen. After all, voice assistants are great ? until you need some visual information to go with their answers. To address this, Amazon launched the Echo Show and Spot last year and now it¡¯s Google¡¯s turn. But it¡¯s not launching a Google Home with a screen. Instead, the company today announced it is working with JBL, Lenovo, LG and Sony to launch new smart displays later this year.Gummi Hafsteinsson, the product management director for Google Assistant, told me these touch-enabled devices, which Google likes to call ¡°smart displays,¡± will support all of the standard Google services you would expect to find on what is essentially a Google Home with a screen. Think YouTube, Google Photos, Duo for video calling and more. In addition, though, Google will open the platform to developers, who will be able to write their own actions (which is what Google now calls any¡¦ well¡¦ action you perform with the Assistant).The smart displays also will feature all of the usual Google notifications, similar to the old Google Now screen on Android. This means you¡¯ll see upcoming appointments, reminders, a graphical view of what traffic on your route to work looks like, etc. And while it¡¯s not in use, the display can show you photos from Google Photos, just like your Chromecast.Given that these are Google-enabled displays, you¡¯ll even be able to cast videos directly to them, though, given their size, that¡¯s probably only interesting if you plan on watching a lot of YouTube videos in your kitchen.¡°One thing we¡¯ve noticed is that as people have conversations with the Assistant, there are times where you would love to have a device with a screen,¡± Hafsteinsson told me ahead of the announcement.Prices for these smart displays will likely fall in around $200. Lenovo plans to charge $199 for the eight-inch version of its Smart Display and $249 for its 10-inch display. Other partners haven¡¯t announced pricing yet. Most of the devices we¡¯ve seen so far feature HD displays and all of the usual connectivity options.For now, it¡¯s not clear when exactly these devices will go on sale, but JBL says it will sell its JBL View in the summer (but only in the U.S.) and Lenovo is targeting a similar date.It¡¯s worth noting that there¡¯s another partner involved here, too: at the heart of these devices is Qualcomm¡¯s new Home Hub platform. The company is launching two new system on chips at CES this year (the SDA 624 and SDA 212) that support Google¡¯s Android Things platform. The 624, specifically, is what¡¯s powering these smart displays thanks to its support of video cameras and touch displays.Seshu Madavapeddy, Qualcomm¡¯s VP of product management for IoT, told me his company is making a major investment in IoT devices for the home and he believes that Google is taking the right approach by making Android Things ? and hence the Google Assistant ? available on multiple platforms.Google also is bringing the Assistant to more Android TV devices. So far, the Sony Bravia TVs and Nvidia¡¯s Shield TV were the only ones, but now?Changhong, Funai and Haier are also on board and LG will soon launch a new line of LG TVs with the Assistant built in, too.Google also is expanding its partner ecosystem in the headphone space, where JBL, LG and Sony are launching headphones that are optimized for use with the Assistant (so you can walk down the Las Vegas Strip and talk to the Assistant).While it¡¯s no surprise that Google is interested in these smart displays, it¡¯s a bit of a surprise that it¡¯s working with partners first and not launching its own Google Home-branded device. Hafsteinsson likened this to Google¡¯s approach to Assistant-enabled headphones. It launched these with Bose first and only then announced its own Pixel Buds (to middling reviews). Since we¡¯ve already heard rumors about Google building its own device, though, I wouldn¡¯t be surprised if Google launched its own smart display sometime in 2018, too.Hafsteinsson also stressed that Google worked very closely with these partners. ¡°We want to make sure we deliver a really good experience,¡± he told me, stressing that in these early days ¡°you want to make sure that the quality matters as much as the quantity.¡± He also noted that opening up the Assistant ecosystem allows for more differentiation. ¡°People have preferences for a particular design, audio quality, etc.,¡± he told me. ¡°People look at other factors beyond the assistant.¡±"

And unlike big competitors like Samsung and LG, Sony hasn¡¯t spent much of the past few weeks showing its hand, so there¡¯s going to be plenty of unknown here.That said, if past years are any indication (as they nearly always are), this is going to be a big show for TV and audio offerings. Given the way pretty much every other announcement has gone this year, it seems like a safe bet that we¡¯ll see plenty of announcements tied to voice-based AI like Google Assistant.And, of course, this is Sony we¡¯re talking about, so expect lots of general weirdness around the edges.The Sony CES 2018 live blog starts at 5:00pm PST.To recap, a couple of new TVs and headphones. Pretty much everything else was already announced. That was a solid D-/C+ press conference. Maybe next time, Sony.?And Kaz is racing to the end of the world¡¯s shortest Sony press conference.

Bosch and Denso have already partnered with the company on the tech. Intel Moibleye, Nvidia, Hyundai, Kia, Nissan and Toyota are also using the company¡¯s sensors to develop self driving cars.?That helps the vehicles see in blindspots where most drivers can¡¯t.The sensors are also be using to help develop autonomous driving and enhance vehicle safety. More than 10 sensors are used on some cars to capture 360-degree video.As he noted, fairly, most cameras are rocking the company¡¯s sensors, anyway, so the company still gets a cut of that.?Sony is big time in sensors so I¡¯m very interested to see what he has to say.¡°I can see many of you are shooting the press conference with your non-Sony smartphones.¡±Kaz is talking up the company¡¯s Image sensors now. He¡¯s really all over the place this time.?Kaz is talking about the company¡¯s recent struggles in consumer electronics again. ¡°There¡¯s still so much we can do to meaningfully innovate.¡±They come with a charging case that gives them a total of nine hours of battery life. Those are starting to ship in the spring, for $179.?The WF-SP700N are a pair of splashproof, wireless earbuds with built-in noise cancelling.?All right, it¡¯s time to talk personal audio.The X1 Ultimate is a new prototype chip for TV sets for 4K, 8K and OLED panels, processing high res video at a much higher speed.?All of the below will be available this spring.?The Bravias work with Amazon Echo and Google Home devices.?The HT-Z9F is a new sound bar, featuring Dolby Atmos three dimensional acoustic.?The X900F features X-Motion Clarity, designed for high action video like sports.?The A8F Series is the company¡¯s new Bravia set, featuring an X1 Extra processor and acoustic surface technology for better sound.K A N D O ~
Okay, now we¡¯re talking announcements. It¡¯s time to talk TVs.?Kando ? that¡¯s the vibe the company is going for here. Art designed to move you emotionally.?Kaz looks like he¡¯s singing the news in this one.
And now it¡¯s off to Sony Music. It was just fun to hear Kaz say ¡°Sza,¡± honestly.?Jumanji was the number one movie in the North America box office over the weekend. Kaz is also talking up the great new Blade Runner, which did decidedly less well (my words, not his, obviously).?Again, we¡¯re just blazing through last year¡¯s products.?He¡¯s really speeding through now, talking up the company¡¯s latest Xperia camera, which shoots some really spectacular slow motion video.?The company sold 5.9 million units sold over the holidays, bring the told PS4s sold to 73 million.?And straight into Sony¡¯s gaming offerings.?Sony is very strong in the camera world right now ? the alpha and RX cameras are well thought of. So I¡¯m happy to hear Kaz chat about them.You line a bunch of them up in a circle and shoot in something akin to bullet time.?Straight into the RXO ? an ultra compact, waterproof camera. A GoPro competitor of sorts.?Interesting, the silent shutter makes it much better for shooting on the golf course.?Apparently it¡¯s really nice for shooting photos of Tiger Woods.?We¡¯ve launched straight into cameras. He¡¯s talking the company¡¯s Alpha 9 mirrorless now.?Kaz is certain that the company is back on track and ready to deliver positive financial results (and gadgets, one hopes).?Three Kazes, actually.

42,gadgets,"Facebook VP of VR Hugo Barra made a surprise announcement during Qualcomm¡¯s press conference at CES. Barra previously led Xiaomi¡¯s international efforts. So it wasn¡¯t that surprising to see him announce a new partnership between Xiaomi, Qualcomm and Facebook.¡°Xiaomi is our hardware partner for launching Oculus Go globally,¡± Barra said. ¡°Oculus and Xiaomi are jointly announcing a new standalone VR product that is designed specifically for the Chinese market.¡±There are two different news items in this statement. First, while Facebook already announced the Oculus Go, it isn¡¯t shipping yet. It looks like Xiaomi is going to manufacture the Oculus Go for most of the world.Second, Xiaomi is launching a standalone VR headset for the Chinese market specifically. This new headset is called the Mi VR Standalone. And it looks and works just like the Oculus Go.The Oculus Go works without a PC, and you don¡¯t need a smartphone either. It¡¯s $199 standalone headset that has everything you need to run VR games and applications. The Oculus Go and Mi VR Standalone are going to use two different interfaces and SDKs. The Xiaomi headset is going to feature the Mi VR SDK while the Oculus Go is going to run the Oculus Platform SDK.The Oculus Go and Xiaomi VR Standalone both use a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 system-on-a-chip and a WQHD LCD screen. It runs all Gear VR titles. So if you don¡¯t have a Samsung phone that works with the Gear VR case, the Oculus Go is an affordable headset to get started.Xiaomi¡¯s VP of Mi Ecosystem and Head of Mi Lab Thomas Tang showed the two headsets on the big screen and joked about the fact that they¡¯re basically the same device with two different logos. Facebook is still mostly banned in China, and Xiaomi is a well-known brand. That could be the reason why Facebook and Xiaomi are going to use the Xiaomi brand in China."

45,gadgets,"Generally speaking, at CES and elsewhere, when a company says something is powered by AI, they¡¯re blowing smoke. And while smoke was definitely blown at LG¡¯s otherwise unremarkable press conference this morning, the company also announced it was applying AI in a way that¡¯s both unexpected and smart: intelligently enhancing TV images using computer vision.Now, before anyone accuses me of falling for the hype, let me just say that this feature is totally unnecessary and probably a bad idea in a lot of ways ? a high-quality and correctly calibrated display panel will give you an excellent image, and things like motion interpolation and intelligent detail enhancement may only worsen it. No, I just think it¡¯s a cool idea.The basic issue is this: given an image on the screen, there are different things that need to happen to make it look better. Color banding can be smoothed, for instance, but if that smoothing operation covers the whole screen, it might obscure important details. So you only want to smooth part of the screen, while perhaps sharpening the more high-contrast parts.This may be accomplished by a number of means, and one is to intelligently identify edges in the image. Then you can divide it into pieces or just sharpen along those edges to emphasize them. But that can be weird if, for example, a building is intersecting the horizon line ? they¡¯ll both get the same enhancement treatment as if the building is part of the land. Basically different parts of the image require different operations, and it¡¯s not always obvious.Note that the image will probably look just fine without any of this. But if you want to enhance the image, these are discrete operations you would want to identify.What LG¡¯s latest TVs do, or what it claims they do at any rate, is apply actual object recognition AI to the problem. This is the kind of thing that, in a specialized form, identifies faces in a picture or can tell whether something is a dog or a cat.In this case, even rudimentary object recognition would allow for a scene to be parsed more intelligently: sky distinct from landscape; landscape distinct from buildings; people and cars distinct from buildings; objects on tables distinct from the tables themselves ? and so on.Not necessarily all at once, you understand. LG¡¯s brief handling of the capability onstage and failure to mention it in any real detail in its announcements suggest to me that this process is at an early stage ? for all we know it may be totally ineffective at this point.But it¡¯s a fun idea and a smart one ? something that¡¯s rather rare at CES. Judicious application of this idea could, for example, allow for the TV to identify items moving jerkily and apply frame interpolation to those only, or allow people to choose which classes of images or objects will receive sharpening, color correction, and so on.I fully expect object-based enhancement to be a standard feature in TVs over the next few years (if not by the end of the week ? it is CES after all), though, of course, truly useful or imaginative applications of it will probably take a little longer."
46,gadgets,"VTech, the maker of smart toys whose poor security practices exposed data from millions of parents and children, has been slapped on the wrist by the FTC to the tune of $650,000 and probation. It seems a light penalty for such a multifaceted failure affecting so many.The Hong Kong company makes a variety of ¡°smart¡± toys, like watches and cameras, and parents and children were encouraged to set up profiles on VTech¡¯s site with pictures and personal details. In November of 2015 a security researcher found that millions of those profiles could be accessed via one of the company¡¯s websites.Not only was the website itself not secure, but the data were not encrypted in transit or at rest, contradicting security claims made in VTech¡¯s privacy policy. This is not just poor practice, it¡¯s a violation of COPPA, a rule meant to protect children¡¯s privacy. The FTC stepped in shortly afterwards to look into these violations.The number of parents and children affected is hard to estimate, but at the time nearly 5 million parent records and 227,000 child records were shown to be accessible. However, the FTC in the summary of its investigation notes:¡¦about 2.25 million parents had registered and created accounts with Learning Lodge for nearly 3 million children. This included about 638,000 Kid Connect accounts for children. In addition, about 134,000 parents in the United States created Planet VTech accounts for 130,000 children by November 2015¡¦And the Canadian Office of the Privacy Commissioner writes that ¡°more than 500,000 Canadian children and their parents¡± were affected. At any rate, the total number is certainly in the millions.The FTC today announced the results of its investigation, namely that VTech violated U.S. law in a couple of ways and failed to secure its data both as promised and as required. Its punishment: pay $650,000 and never do it again. The Canadian OPC doesn¡¯t seem to have issued any punishment at all. (Update: It hasn¡¯t, and legally it can¡¯t. But it would like to.)It¡¯s hardly a heavy fine for a company that was selling millions of devices, and may embolden others weighing the cost of real security against the risk of being caught and fined. It seems unlikely that the parents and children whose data was exposed by the extremely irresponsible actions of a global company will find this settlement satisfying ? however logical it appears to the FTC.It is also worth noting that this is the agency that will be responsible for enforcing part of our new, much-reduced net neutrality rules. If gross negligence and a breach affecting millions, including children, provokes only a minor fine and warning like this ? two years after the fact, by the way ? what hope do we have that the FTC will act as an effective deterrent for the subtler abuses and far richer companies that net neutrality protected people against?You can read the full text of the settlement here (PDF)."

At the time of writing GoPro¡¯s market cap is a hair about $1 billion and its stock price jumped on news the company is looking to sell.GoPro¡¯s stock price went on a ride today. Just prior to the market opening, GoPro announced its revenue will fall short of expectations and a staff reduction of 20%. GoPro¡¯s stock trading was halted in pre-market sales. Once the market open, the stock price dropped nearly 33% though slightly recovered in the following hours.With this news, the stock price saw a bit of a jump though it¡¯s still trading well under the previous day close.It¡¯s unclear who will want to snatch up the camera maker.

It¡¯s a supplemental update to macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 and it includes the same fix.As always, you should update your devices with the latest security patches. In this case, Meltdown and Spectre are serious vulnerabilities. With Meltdown, a malicious application running on an unpatched device can read the unencrypted kernel memory. You don¡¯t want anyone to grab your password and private encryption keys.Meltdown was already addressed in previous updates. iOS 11.2, macOS 10.13.2 and tvOS 11.2 already included mitigations for Meltdown. Apple Watch chips aren¡¯t affected by Meltdown.Spectre isn¡¯t as serious as it only breaks the isolation between multiple applications. But it can be exploited using JavaScript in a web browser. That¡¯s why it¡¯s important to fix it before somebody figures out how to distribute malicious JavaScript code in an ad unit.On your iPhone or iPad, head over to the Settings app, then tap on General and Software Update.

You just know Amazon wants to wiggle its way in.For now, that means third-party accessories. This morning we saw Anker launch a little Alexa-powered box that plugs into your 12V cigarette outlet. Now, here at CES, Garmin is announcing an Alexa-powered dash cam.Called the Garmin Speak Plus, it¡¯s actually a follow-up to a device the company launched in October of last year that shared the same name, minus the ¡°Plus.¡± The main difference here? It¡¯s about 80 bucks more ($149 MSRP for the Speak, or $229 for the Speak Plus,) but it has a built-in dash cam.There¡¯s a little screen on the front to relay directions as you drive about, and it connects to your car¡¯s stereo by way of Bluetooth or AUX port. The camera runs at 1080fp at 30 frames per second, and packs a few little tricks like collision and lane-departure warnings (though, depending on how stable your Bluetooth audio connection is from the Speak Plus to your car, I¡¯m not sure I¡¯d rely on those). It taps your phone¡¯s cell connection, meanwhile, for all its various data needs (GPS routing, processing Alexa commands, etc.)The Speak Plus is available for pre-order now, and should ship sometime in mid-February."

It¡¯s a convenient, single-cable solution that eliminates the need for recharging.The Ring Beams LED lights come in pathway light, stairway light and spotlight flavors, and provide relatively easy to install, energy-efficient connected LED lights that can easily work with your exiting Ring devices, including security cams and the Ring video doorbell, to add additional elements of security and convenience, like allowing you to line your front walkway with lights that trigger when the system detects motion.Ring also revealed that it¡¯s going to begin shipping the Ring Alarm home security system it announced last year starting in 2018, beginning this coming spring."
51,gadgets,"Ring, the connected home security gadget startup, has acquired Mr. Beams, a maker of LED lighting with wireless connectivity and motion-sensing capabilities. The Mr. Beams acquisition is intended to help Ring bolster its existing portfolio of connected doorbells, video cameras and combination floodlight/cameras with affordable, modular lighting that can integrated with Ring¡¯s software and services.Mr. Beams¡¯ lights come in a variety of flavors, including pathway lights and lights that can affix easily to exterior walls, can also connect wirelessly, and forthcoming versions due out later this year will be able to trigger based on action detected by Ring¡¯s smart devices, including its Video Doorbell products and smart cameras.Ring founder James Siminoff says that the tech will help with Ring¡¯s larger goal of making neighborhoods generally safer, as well as protecting individual houses. The small, easy to install lights can be used virtually anywhere, letting homeowners easily create networks of lighting that can illuminate the area should they detect any motion, which might help ward off anyone intending to do any wrong.Mr. Beams will operate as an independent division within Ring, the company says, and will release products under its own brand as well as under Ring¡¯s. the financial terms of the deal were not disclosed."
52,gadgets,"GoPro, already a beloved camera brand, just couldn¡¯t take flight. The GoPro vision ? a little box you can attach to the wing of a plane or your ski helmet and catch unparalleled views of the world ? is cloudy now on news that trading halted this morning due to low performance attributed to price slashing, layoffs, and the closing of the company¡¯s nascent drone division.¡°As we noted in our November earnings call, at the start of the holiday quarter we saw soft demand for our HERO5 Black camera,¡± said GoPro founder and CEO Nicholas Woodman in a release. ¡°Despite significant marketing support, we found consumers were reluctant to purchase HERO5 Black at the same price it launched at one year earlier. Our December 10 holiday price reduction provided a sharp increase in sell-through.¡±The company ended the fourth quarter with $247 million in cash, up $50 million from the pre-holiday Q3 2017 quarter.What is truly happening here is the heat death of another hardware giant. GoPro is, however, unique. There is no comparable product that offers the same functionality which is one of the reasons it¡¯s held on so long. You can¡¯t strap a cellphone to your chest and get the same footage nor can you do safely do videography tricks like mounting a few GoPros on a chase car to film an action scene. That said, the action camera market is now a commodity and, though none of the pretenders offer anything remotely like GoPro¡¯s quality, the price from Alibaba and Amazon is right.Acquisition imminent. https://t.co/YPSzfQPFLY?

Shawn DuBravac, PhD (@shawndubravac) January 8, 2018I¡¯ve called the deaths of multiple hardware products in the past and I¡¯ve always had my gimlet eye on GoPro. They grew big fast, IPOed, and then tried to do business in a changed world. Like Flip before them, they became a fad then a tool then a commodity finally leading to a battle that they were never born to win.When your company is tied up in one popular product ? Palm, Fitbit, and Makerbot come to mind ? competition heats up quickly. Other hardware makers start gunning for you and, before you know it, the dinosaurs (Apple, HP, Samsung) come along to eat you.My call? GoPro is bought by DJI or Samsung this year, runs for a brief moment as a standalone product, and then is folded into the company proper. It¡¯s a respectful end to a wonderful product whose golden days are past."

The company says it plans to reduce its headcount in 2018 from 1,254 employees to fewer than 1,000. It also plans to exit the drone market and reduce CEO 2018 compensation to $1.Pre-market trading of GoPro shares have halted on the news.The layoffs were expected. Last week TechCrunch reported exclusively on the firings with sources telling us several hundred employees were relieved of duties though officially kept on the books until the middle of February. We were told that the bulk of the layoffs happened in the engineering department of the Karma drone.GoPro says in today¡¯s announcement that it expects its fourth quarter revenue to be $340 million, a roughly 37% decline over 2016 levels. The company says a the revenue includes negative impact of approximately $80 for price protection for its Hero, Session and Karma products.¡°As we noted in our November earnings call, at the start of the holiday quarter we saw soft demand for our HERO5 Black camera,¡± said GoPro founder and CEO Nicholas Woodman in a released statement. ¡°Despite significant marketing support, we found consumers were reluctant to purchase HERO5 Black at the same price it launched at one year earlier.

54,gadgets,"All-in-one drone management app Kittyhawk has added yet another feature: multi-waypoint automated flights. This is an essential feature for lots of commercial drone applications and testing, and the fewer apps and platforms you need to accomplish a task, the better.Kittyhawk (not to be confused with Larry Page and Sebastian Thrun¡¯s Kitty Hawk) is an app that puts many of the most frequently needed drone-related services in one place: pre-flight checklists, airspace maps, hyperlocal weather, flight planning, live secure video, and now, direct flight automation via waypoints.It¡¯s pretty straightforward: just set your home location, then start picking coordinates, altitudes, and attitudes ? as well as some aesthetic choices like whether you want the drone to round off its turns or follow them down to inch.In a helpful touch that may prevent some embarrassing flight failures, the system won¡¯t let you set waypoints outside the range of the drone or the control radio. So no accidentally fat-fingering a flight path that takes your Phantom a couple thousand miles off course.There are plenty of options out there for the many new commercial and semi-pro drone operations popping up all over the place, but it never hurts to add more capabilities or gather them into one handy app. The new features should arrive soon, but the company didn¡¯t provide a date."
55,gadgets,"After raising $28 million last November to add more firepower to its growth, Kano is unveiling the newest addition to its range of build-it-yourself gadgets that you use to learn to code: a camera.London-based Kano is using this week¡¯s CES in Las Vegas to show off a full prototype of the new Camera Kit?? designed to work with Kano¡¯s existing suite of gadgets, which include a computer kit, a motion sensor and the Pixel?animated lightbox.The camera is launching at an unspecified date later this year, so there¡¯s no official price attached to it yet (although a Kickstarter page giving a sneak peek of it last year said it would cost $129.99). You can register your interest for ordering one?here.As with its previous hardware ? which has been used by around 200,000 people?globally, who have coded and posted to Kano¡¯s community over more than 380,000 apps, artworks, songs and games that they¡¯ve created using that hardware ? the idea behind the Kano¡¯s camera is two-fold.First, the company aims to make tech and the use of it more accessible by demystifying how it works by giving people the components and instructions to assemble the camera themselves. Second, it then carries on the step-by-step nature by gradually introducing different functions and showing users how to use them to build software for their newly assembled hardware.While the lightbox, for example, let you create light-based artwork and games, the camera gives users the ability to ¡°code¡± it to make different photo filters, GIFs, and to modify the settings for how the image is captured in the first place.Adding a camera into the mix is an important step for Kano.With the rise of smartphones and mobile phones in general ? and their move into becoming a near-ubiquitous computing and communications device for younger people ? the camera has become one of the most significant and used features of these devices. These days, having a device for capturing and manipulating images would feel like something important is missing, not just for users but for Kano itself as part of its mission.¡°What we are doing here has not really been attempted for several decades,¡± CEO and co-founder Alex Klein told me last year. ¡°We are building a computing company end to end.¡±?What this also means is that having one as part of the Kano suite gives the whole platform a new profile with a new group of users. There will always be those who are happy tinkering with any gadget and learning how it works, but potentially, those who may be less interested in building games, might be more interested in figuring out how a digital camera works and customising it.¡°Our goal is to open up technology, so that anyone can understand and shape it,¡± said Klein in a statement today. ¡°We are thrilled to bring simple, playful, creative computing to CES for the first time.¡±Part of that mission has been also to use different channels to appeal to a wider audience. That¡¯s included revealing new devices and uses in YouTube videos, and sneak-peaks on crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter. The page where Kano had first unveiled the camera among other new gadgets last year has already picked up more than $643,000 in backing.Kano also, of course, also uses more traditional routes to sell products. Its devices are sold in Best Buys and Targets in North America, selected Walmart stores, Amazon,?Barnes & Noble, Best Buy, Indigo, Microsoft, The Source and Toys ¡°R¡± Us ? some 4,500 retailers in all."

Starting in late spring 2018, Bose will become one of Tile¡¯s biggest new partners, as it will begin to sell its Bose SoundSport Wireless and QuietControl 30 headphones with Tile¡¯s technology embedded inside.Existing devices will receive the new feature as a firmware update ? the first time that Tile¡¯s software has been downloaded into devices already in users¡¯ homes, in fact.Once installed, Tile¡¯s app can locate the Bose headphones as it would any other Tile device. You can ¡°ring¡± the headphones to find them using the app, and the volume will progressively get louder the longer it rings.Of course, Tile today continues to be best known for its keychain-style square dongles that can be attached to items you want to keep track of ? like your keys, purse, bag, bike, wallet and more. But the company¡¯s larger goal has always been to create a global community of users who become the backbone of a distributed network that can be tapped into at anytime to help locate missing items.To date, Tile has sold 13 million devices, giving it a 90 percent share in the ¡°lost item finder¡± market, according to NPD. Its community now spans 230 countries and territories worldwide and is used to find over 2 million items per day. Tile also reported $100 million in revenue in 2016.The addition of Bose comes alongside the announcement of several new partners that have confirmed plans to integrate Tile into their products. Other new additions include Samsonite, which will make luggage that doesn¡¯t get lost; Propeller Health, which will add Tile¡¯s technology to its?connected inhalers for people with?asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; Boosted, which will add Tile to its Boosted Boards; plus baby wearable maker Starling; and Herschel, which makes wallets, keychain holders and passport holders.These join existing partners, like Away Travel, SuitSupply, Blunt Umbrellas, G-RO, This is Ground, Fossil, Kenneth Cole, Ricardo Beverly Hills, Axiom, Nomad, Keysmart, and Keyline/Bianca.Tile is also adding a range of access points partnerships to expand its network, thanks to deals with Comcast, Ruckus Networks, and San Jose International Airport. The airport deal went live in November 2017 and Tile says it¡¯s already seen a 20 percent increase in same-day found rates, bringing the rate to 95 percent.¡°It¡¯s exciting to see the Tile community grow exponentially, not only with more consumers but also with leading brands and even locations,¡± said Mike Farley, CEO and Co-Founder of Tile, in a statement. ¡°Airports are just the beginning. We¡¯re looking at all high-traffic areas where things that matter to us are commonly lost ? hotels and malls, as well as homes and neighborhoods. With these key partnerships, we truly are blanketing the world with smart location.¡±The new partnerships announced today will kick off in spring 2018, with Bose¡¯s integrations and Samsonite¡¯s global pilot."
57,gadgets,"Anker¡¯s mobile division Roav is today announcing an in-vehicle Alexa device. Called Viva, the device plugs into a 12-volt cigarette lighter outlet and turns Alexa into a co-pilot of sorts. After using it on a 4 hour road trip, though, I found the device adequate but left much to be desired. For one, it doesn¡¯t support Spotify and occasionally it requires the user to interact with the smartphone while driving.Setup is easy but takes a few steps. The user needs to plug the device into the vehicle and pair it with a smartphone. The smartphone also needs to be paired with the vehicle¡¯s Bluetooth connection. The clever system streams audio from the Viva to the vehicle through this link while the smartphone is also streaming other content.In practice the Viva works fine if its limitations are understood. Don¡¯t tell it turn on Spotify. That doesn¡¯t work. If directions are requested, exact phrasing needs to be used and in some cases, the driver will have to use their smartphone. And since this is an add-on unit, it does not have any control over in-vehicle systems.The Viva features a stripped down version of Alexa and it shows.I¡¯m not convinced the Viva is a necessary gadget. It does not do anything substantially better than Siri or Google Assistant. And since the Viva is reliant on a smartphone, there¡¯s a good chance users will already have a device equipped with one of the other voice assistants.The Viva will cost $49.99 when it comes out in early 2018. It¡¯s novel, but I fear most units will quickly lose their appeal and end up forgotten in a glovebox."

The feature is now live in English, with more languages coming later this year. Search for the Netatmo Smart Home Bot in Messenger to start using it.Netatmo has always tried to embrace as many ways as possible to control your devices. You can control your Netatmo devices using Siri and Apple¡¯s HomeKit, an Amazon Echo device and anything that comes with Alexa, Google Home and now Messenger.You¡¯ll be able to type straightforward queries, such as ¡°turn on the lights in the living room¡± and ¡°adjust the temperature in the bedroom to 72¡Æ.¡± But the chatbot will also handle more complex queries, such as ¡°who¡¯s at home right now¡± and ¡°what¡¯s the weather like right now.¡± Netatmo says that the chatbot is going to get better over time once you start using it.I¡¯m still not sure the connected home is going to happen. But I believe people will need many different ways to control their devices. There won¡¯t be an Amazon Echo in every single room, and it¡¯s also quite convenient to control your home while you¡¯re already texting a friend. I hope Netatmo is going to release its chatbot in more messaging apps though.The company first started with a sophisticated connected weather station but has since expanded to more product lines. Netatmo now sells indoor and outdoor security cameras, connected thermostats and radiator valves, an air quality monitoring device.Last year, the company announced a couple of partnerships with existing home appliance brands to connect everything in your home. For instance, home makers can now buy connected switches from Legrand and connected windows from Velux. This program is called ¡°with Netatmo¡±.Chances are you won¡¯t change your window just so that it closes automatically when it rains. That¡¯s why Netatmo targets construction companies that want to build and sell connected homes from day one. So far BNP Paribas Real Estate and Vinci Immobilier have built around 140 apartments with Netatmo solutions.So it¡¯s not a huge market for now, but the company is going to roll out connected radiators with Groupe Muller called Intuiv with Netatmo. It¡¯s a smart heating device that automatically adjust the temperature based on user habits.Netatmo has developed a connected module that is compatible with many different Groupe Muller radiators that have been sold since 2000. Slowly but surely, Netatmo is expanding its product range to all sorts of appliances and use cases."

They are now just chatting about stuff and some VW people seem to be enjoying the conversation.There is still a good chance this press conference will go two hours.We had a bunch of partner announcements today. Interesting to see how much the focus here is now on VW. No other partners were on stage.Diess thinks individual cars still have a bright future. Not just robotaxis.If you spend more time in the car ? if you do games or whatever ? you want your own environment in your car, Dr. Diess is saying.Diess is saying the move to AV will cause the car to loss much of its negative.?¡°If you¡¯re driving a Volkswagen, it¡¯s fun to drive.

I don¡¯t follow a lot of it, but it sounds just swell.There¡¯s an ARM64 chip in here, too.But if you want a safe car, your chip has to continue to function even when there are faults. Nvidia built lots of redundancy into the Xavier to work around this.And since it¡¯s going in cars, this chip, or its successors, will have to work in an environment completely hostel to computers.?The Xavier is the largest SoC the world has ever made, Nvidia claims. It took 8,000 engineering years to build it.Jensen just announced the Drive Xavier with sampling in Q1. It¡¯s the most complex SOC ever mad with 9 billion transistors, 350mm2, and 12nFFN.¡°I can tell you without exception, building computers for autonomous vehicles is beyond the complexity of anything the world has ever known.¡± It can never fail because lives are at stake.¡°The number of challenges it takes to bring AV to the world is utterly daunting.¡±He points to the Amazon effect of buying online, causing someone to having to bring the purchase to a person¡¯s house.Trucking: AV is going to revolutionize trucking, he says.I think AV will revolutionize mobility services.¡°AV can revolutionize mobility services.¡±His kicker is this: AV can reduce cost-per-mile to to the same level as car ownership.He points to the data point that in the next 10 years traffic will be increased by a factor of 3.¡°AV will also revolutionize mobility services.¡±?He¡¯s calling autonomous vehicles, AV.?Jensen is starting out talking about self-driving cars talking about the pains and dangers of driving.

It¡¯s of course faster.With the CPU for inference, you can look at five images per second. ¡°Ten years ago, this would¡¯ve been a miracle.¡±This is your standard AI demo. Somehow it¡¯s running a bit slow, too, but that¡¯s because it¡¯s running on an Intel CPU.This demo is hokey. It¡¯s scrolling across images. I¡¯m sure Nvidia is proud of this but it doesn¡¯t look like anything.The assumption is now also that everybody knows what inference is. Matt doesn¡¯t, but it¡¯s basically what you do when you use a machine learning model to do stuff. A model that¡¯s already been trained, that is.We¡¯re about to see a demo on deep learning with flowers. I like flowers.¡°The more you buy from Jensen, the more money you save. Incredible savings.

60,gadgets,"CES 2018 is here and it feels different to the TechCrunch team. Maybe we¡¯re jaded. We¡¯ve been doing this for years, fighting the scrum and braving this unholy city of filth.CES 2018 feels more corporate than in the past few years. Google is here in a major way. The company has a two-story booth with a slide. Google wasn¡¯t here in the same capacity in the same way and the company clearly wants to make up for it. Google is impossible to miss at CES 2018.CES goes through changes as the consumer market changes. Apple and Amazon are winning and startups are losing. Hardware startups are struggling to gain a footing but they¡¯re still trying so that¡¯s why we¡¯re here.It almost feels like companies are at CES 2018 because they¡¯re afraid not to be here. It¡¯s important to remember that CES is a trade show at its core and primarily designed for companies to meet buyers and partners. The press is secondary and the show is not open to the general public. Products announced here generally do not hit the consumer market for months; some never launch.For CES 2018 TechCrunch decided to bring fewer people and not to do a stage show or live stream from the show floor. We were one of the first outlets to do both and we decided to do something more intimate than in the past. We still have a location at the show but it¡¯s a large meeting space were we can have longer conversations with more companies. Stop by and see if any appointments are left.The show officially starts on Tuesday, which is when we¡¯ll be at our booth, but press events start tonight. As John Biggs wrote about CES 2011, let the boredom begin."
61,gadgets,"Putting solar panels into our roads isn¡¯t the craziest idea, but we may as well admit that it poses some unique challenges. For instance, people may want to walk away with pieces of it. That¡¯s what happened in China, anyway, just five days after authorities opened up what they claim is the world¡¯s first solar panel-paved highway.As reported by the Qilu Evening News (and noted by TechNode), the experimental kilometer-long stretch of road in Shandong is covered in more than 10,000 solar panels, sandwiched between an insulating layer on the bottom and a durable, transparent one on top ? less than 3 cm thick all told. There are coils that may in the future charge electric cars as they drive over it, and the system can even warm up in order to melt snow and ice. It opened to use on December 28.Unfortunately, during an inspection on the morning of January 2, officials found a narrow piece missing, neatly cut. About 6 inches wide and 6 feet long, the piece didn¡¯t appear to have detached on its own ? suggesting someone stole it. But why?Solar panels are cheap, and this wasn¡¯t very much of them anyway. One official said it may cost thousands to repair, but why such a small piece? And why not take it before the road was operational? If sabotage was the goal, why cleanly take such a small chunk instead of damaging or painting over a larger section?That it appears to have been done by a ¡°professional team,¡± (Google¡¯s translation) according to an industry source cited by the local news channel, may give some insight. Perhaps they¡¯re interested in the technology, speculated another source.Indeed if a group wanted to replicate the photovoltaic sandwich and offer a similar product for a lower price, this might be exactly what they¡¯d do. The practice is not uncommon in China, but this seems an unlikely target for counterfeiting.At any rate, the road is now open after repairs were made, and no further pieces have been stolen. The biggest loss here, for now anyway, seems to have been commuters¡¯ time. The local police, however, are continuing their investigation."
62,gadgets,"GoPro is in the process of laying off around 200-300 employees this week, TechCrunch has learned from sources close to the company. The hits to the company were largely concentrated in its aerial division, the segment of the company responsible for its Karma drone. In a letter to impacted employees GoPro explained these cuts are part of a larger restructuring ¡°to better align our resources with business requirements¡±.?TechCrunch has been informed by sources that the company relieved impacted employees of duties today but will keep them on the payroll until February 16, likely planning to hold this news for after CES and perhaps tie it to an upcoming earnings report as in past instances.The belt-tightening won¡¯t come as much of a surprise to those following the action camera maker¡¯s moves into drones over the past several years. GoPro¡¯s Karma drone has been a headache from the start, both with regards to its technical limitations and a mass recall after reports stated drones were dropping from the sky late last year.The company chalked the potentially dangerous mishap up to the battery disconnecting mid-flight. GoPro temporarily halted sales on the product, bringing it back to market in February. The return prompted some positive financials for the company, and sales did ultimately take off after the reboot, but the Karma¡¯s appeal has been dulled by one-time partner DJI, which introduced its own portable drones, the Mavik Pro and Spark to the market. The two companies had reportedly been working on the project that would ultimately become the Karma, only to ultimately part ways. Of course, DJI¡¯s wealth of experience in the space gave the company a decided leg up on GoPro¡¯s latest attempt to diversify. The company also reportedly sought partnerships with other drone makers including Southern California¡¯s 3DR.?Diversification has been an important part of the CEO Nick Woodman¡¯s business plan in recent years, as the market has been flooded with competing action cameras. GoPro is still synonymous with the space, but the prevalence of improved smartphone cameras, along with far cheaper GoPro alternatives, have forced the company to explore additional revenue streams, including drones and VR.But it¡¯s been precisely those attempts to diversify that have been on the chopping block for the company. GoPro¡¯s entertainment division was a key target during a layoffs in late 2016.The company had one of its worst years on record in 2016. GoPro let 100 people go from its entertainment division in late 2016 and then an additional 270 jobs were eliminated in March of 2017.?Though the company¡¯s earnings improved in 17Q2 earnings seemingly appearing to appeared to indicate that its decision to tighten its belt and streamline its focus worked.It seems, however, that the rebound wasn¡¯t enough to right the ship completely.We¡¯ve reached out to GoPro for comment and will update as soon as we hear back."
63,gadgets,"Apple isn¡¯t immune to Meltdown and Spectre, the major bugs in basic computing architecture that were announced yesterday to widespread amazement and horror. In an announcement, the company said that ¡°all Mac systems and iOS devices are affected,¡± which sounds right, but that mitigations are either already in place or on the way.If you¡¯re still not clear on the whole debacle, I went into detail on it yesterday. Basically, a couple of tricks processors have been using for decades turn out to have a couple extremely serious vulnerabilities and could be used to reveal all kinds of protected data to malicious actors.Fortunately, as Apple puts it, ¡°there are no known exploits impacting customers at this time.¡± But you better believe it won¡¯t stay that way for long. To prevent being the lucky first victim (that we know of) of one of the most serious security issues of the decade, please do check if your devices are up to date.For some devices, it was handled a while ago: ¡°Apple released mitigations for Meltdown in iOS 11.2, macOS 10.13.2, and tvOS 11.2.¡± Apple Watch is safe, since Meltdown is a problem with Intel processors and it doesn¡¯t have any. Although reports have warned of performance hits, Apple says it has observed ¡°no measurable reduction¡± in benchmark scores.For Spectre, which is a trickier beast both to take advantage of and to fix, patches are forthcoming. ¡°Apple will release an update for Safari on macOS and iOS in the coming days to mitigate these exploit techniques.¡±If you¡¯re wondering why people keep saying ¡°mitigate¡± instead of ¡°fix¡± or ¡°counteract¡± or something, it¡¯s because Meltdown and Spectre take advantage of computing practices so basic that avoiding them is extremely difficult and complex. And new variants of attacks may very well circumvent the protections companies have put together during the last few months during which the exploits were kept secret. The mitigations and patches will probably multiply.In the meantime, since the exploits seem to only apply to code running natively on your machine, Apple¡¯s advice is ¡°downloading software only from trusted sources such as the App Store.¡± Nice try, Apple! I¡¯d rather face an existential threat to computing than use the Mac App Store."
64,gadgets,"Nintendo has managed to sell so many of its Nintendo Switch console that it¡¯s become not only its own fastest-selling console, but also the fastest selling in the U.S. ever, beating the record set by the Wii back during its launch. The Switch has sold over 4.8 million units in its first 10 months of availability, which beats out the Wii¡¯s 4 million sold during the same initial window.The success of the Switch probably isn¡¯t surprising to anyone who owns one, or to those who¡¯ve been following its rise. The console had a strong start thanks to flagship title The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which has been purchased by over 55 percent of Switch console owners. Also, Nintendo revealed that Super Mario Odyssey is on over 55 percent of Switch consoles, and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe all has an ownership rate of more than 50 percent. Clearly, marquee first-party software is doing a lot to drive demand for Nintendo¡¯s hybrid home/portable console.Nintendo is looking good going into 2018 based on these numbers, and the overall performance of the Switch should quickly eclipse the lifetime sales of the Wii U, which never really struck a chord with consumers. The game lineup for the forthcoming year will be a big determining factor in terms of figuring out what kind of pace is maintained with continued console sales after the initial thrill of the Switch dies down a little."
65,gadgets,"If you¡¯re confused by the avalanche of early reports, denials, and conflicting statements about the massive security issues announced today, don¡¯t worry ? you¡¯re far from the only one. Here¡¯s what you need to know about Meltdown and Spectre, the two huge bugs that affect practically every computer and device out there.Short answer: Bugs at a fundamental level that allow critical information stored deep inside computer systems to be exposed.Security researchers released official documentation ? complete with nicknames and logos ?? of two major flaws found in nearly all modern central processing units, or CPUs.It¡¯s not a physical problem with the CPUs themselves, or a plain software bug you might find in an application like Word or Chrome. It¡¯s in between, at the level of the processors¡¯ ¡°architectures,¡± the way all the millions of transistors and logic units work together to carry out instructions.In modern architectures, there are inviolable spaces where data passes through in raw, unencrypted form, such as inside the kernel, the most central software unit in the architecture, or in system memory carefully set aside from other applications. This data has powerful protections to prevent it from being interfered with or even observed by other processes and applications.Meltdown and Spectre are two techniques researchers have discovered that circumvent those protections, exposing nearly any data the computer processes, such as passwords, proprietary information, or encrypted communications.Meltdown primarily affects Intel processors, and works by breaking through the barrier that prevents applications from accessing arbitrary locations in kernel memory. Segregating and protecting memory spaces prevents applications from accidentally interfering with one another¡¯s data, or malicious software from being able to see and modify it at will. Meltdown makes this fundamental process fundamentally unreliable.Spectre affects Intel, AMD, and ARM processors, broadening its reach to include mobile phones, embedded devices, and pretty much anything with a chip in it. Which, of course, is everything from thermostats to baby monitors now.It works differently from Meltdown; Spectre essentially tricks applications into accidentally disclosing information that would normally be inaccessible, safe inside their protected memory area. This is a trickier one to pull off, but because it¡¯s based on an established practice in multiple chip architectures, it¡¯s going to be even trickier to fix.Short answer: Pretty much everybody.Chips going back to 2011 were tested and found vulnerable, and theoretically it could affect processors as far back as those released in 1995. One would hope there aren¡¯t too many of those in use, but we may be unpleasantly surprised on that count.Because Meltdown and Spectre are flaws at the architecture level, it doesn¡¯t matter whether a computer or device is running Windows, OS X, Android, or something else ? all software platforms are equally vulnerable.A huge variety of devices, from laptops to smartphones to servers, are therefore theoretically affected. The assumption going forward should be that any untested device should be considered vulnerable.Not only that, but Meltdown in particular could conceivably be applied to and across cloud platforms, where huge numbers of networked computers routinely share and transfer data among thousands or millions of users and instances.The good news is that the attack is easiest to perform by code being run by the machine itself ? it¡¯s not easy to pull this off remotely. So there¡¯s that, at least.Short answer: Only partially, and it¡¯s going to take a while.Many, many devices are ¡°affected¡± or ¡°vulnerable¡± to these flaws, but that¡¯s not the same thing as saying they¡¯re totally open to attack. Intel, AMD, ARM and others have had months to create workarounds and ¡°mitigations,¡± which is a polite way of saying ¡°band-aids.¡±Meltdown can be fixed essentially by building a stronger wall around the kernel; the technical term is ¡°kernel page table isolation.¡± This solves the issue, but there¡¯s a cost. Modern CPU architectures assume certain things about the way the kernel works and is accessed, and changing those things means that they won¡¯t be able to operate at full capacity.The Meltdown fix may reduce the performance of Intel chips by as little as 5 percent or as much as 30 ? but there will be some hit. Whatever it is, it¡¯s better than the alternative.Spectre, on the other hand, is not likely to be fully fixed any time soon. The fact is that the practice that leads to this attack being possible is so hard-wired into processors that the researchers couldn¡¯t find any way to totally avoid it. They list a few suggestions, but conclude:While the stop-gap countermeasures described in the previous section may help limit practical exploits in the short term, there is currently no way to know whether a particular code construction is, or is not, safe across today¡¯s processors ? much less future designs.What will actually happen is hard to say, but there will likely be a flurry of updates that carry out various software hacks to protect against the most obvious and damaging attacks. Microsoft has already issued one for Windows; ARM has a set of mitigations for its affected chips; Amazon is updating its many servers.How broadly and quickly will these mitigation patches be applied, though? How many devices are out there, vulnerable, right now? These updates may not be pretty, perhaps requiring changes that will break other software, drivers, and components. And all will likely involve degrading performance.A more permanent fix will require significant changes across the board ? the circuit board, that is. Basic architecture choices that have been baked into our devices for years, even decades, will have to be rethought. It won¡¯t be easy, and it won¡¯t be fun.In the meantime companies are working at full capacity to minimize the apparent threat: ¡°mitigations¡± that may or may not prevent some or all of the variant attacks. As usual, these patches will likely reach only a small subset of new, fast-updating users and devices, or those the company can update directly on its own. We will only know the efficacy of these measures by their performance in the real world.It¡¯s worth noting that there won¡¯t be a ¡°recall.¡± If this flaw affected a single device, like the battery problems in Samsung¡¯s phones a while back, a recall would make sense. But this is an issue that affects millions, perhaps billions of devices. A recall isn¡¯t an option.Short answer: A planned joint disclosure was preempted by reporters.It¡¯s always a bit odd to hear that companies were informed of a major security flaw like this one months ago, as was the case with Meltdown and Spectre. This particular exploit has been under investigation for some time by researchers, and word of it trickled out in the form of small updates to various operating systems addressing a hitherto-undocumented security flaw.If the researchers just tweeted out the details when they discovered them, it would essentially be giving attackers access to that information at the same time as the companies that can fix the problem. Generally security investigators do what¡¯s called responsible disclosure, contacting affected companies secretly, either as a simple courtesy or in order to collaborate on a solution.In this case Google contacted Intel several months ago, and no doubt others knew to some degree as well, since Microsoft issued patches to insiders well ahead of the public announcement, and Linux distributions were likewise addressing the issue even though the papers describing the flaw were not out yet.The plan would normally be that the affected company or companies would come up with a solution, quietly apply it, then announce both the flaw and the solution at the same time. And in fact that seems to be what was planned in this case.But smart reporting by The Register, which among others put together the disparate pieces, seems to have forced the hands of several billion-dollar companies. The companies scrambled to finalize their statements, addressing ¡°inaccurate¡± media reports and hastily issuing patches and explanations that likely weren¡¯t due until next week.While some may suggest that El Reg should have let things take their course, there¡¯s a great deal to be said for not allowing the billion-dollar companies in question to completely control the narrative around a major issue like this. If the only version of the story we ever heard was one approved by their joint committee, things would likely have been painted in a different light.As the researchers put it at the end of the the Spectre paper:The vulnerabilities in this paper, as well as many others, arise from a longstanding focus in the technology industry on maximizing performance. As a result, processors, compilers, device drivers, operating systems, and numerous other critical components have evolved compounding layers of complex optimizations that introduce security risks. As the costs of insecurity rise, these design choices need to be revisited, and in many cases alternate implementations optimized for security will be required."
66,gadgets,"Reports this morning that Intel processors are affected by a serious flaw that may reduce performance significantly hit the company¡¯s credibility and stock hard. Intel has now officially responded to these reports, calling them ¡°incorrect¡± and ¡°inaccurate,¡± and saying it had planned to discuss this very issue next week.The flaw makes it possible for ordinary users and processes to access data deep in the inner mechanisms of the processor and architecture ? specifically, kernel memory. The possibilities for bad actors taking advantage of such a gaping hole are numerous, and unfortunately there is no easy solution that does not also slow the processor¡¯s operations considerably.In its statement, issued ¡°because of the current inaccurate media reports,¡± Intel writes:Recent reports that these exploits are caused by a ¡°bug¡± or a ¡°flaw¡± and are unique to Intel products are incorrect. Based on the analysis to date, many types of computing devices ? with many different vendors¡¯ processors and operating systems ? are susceptible to these exploits.In other words, it¡¯s not just them. This may seem like deflection, but it¡¯s also possible that the issue is more widespread than just Intel hardware ? and Intel isn¡¯t likely to blow smoke with a claim that can¡¯t be verified. Other major chip and OS companies are almost certainly all already aware of the problem; indeed, Intel says some were about to make a joint announcement:Intel is committed to product and customer security and is working closely with many other technology companies, including AMD, ARM Holdings and several operating system vendors, to develop an industry-wide approach to resolve this issue promptly and constructively.Intel and other vendors had planned to disclose this issue next week when more software and firmware updates will be available.You can expect most official details then; joint disclosures of major security issues by billion-dollar companies tend to come out on their own time. (Update: However, some companies are issuing emergency fixes and press releases today. This story is developing.)Intel downplayed the performance hit: ¡°Contrary to some reports, any performance impacts are workload-dependent, and, for the average computer user, should not be significant and will be mitigated over time,¡± the statement read.That¡¯s good, but no doubt the impact will be measured carefully by benchmarks and explained in detail ? some setups and applications will surely be affected more than others."

68,gadgets,"The Switch may be the most pleasant tech surprise of 2017, but although it has many excellent qualities, excessive storage space is not among them. And it looks like that will continue to be a problem if, as The Wall Street Journal hears, Nintendo is delaying the production of 64-gigabyte cartridges.Right now you can fit up to 32 gigabytes on a cart, which of course is usually plenty ? but games with large amounts of content or high-resolution resources are already bumping up against that limit.If there¡¯s not enough room on the cartridge, users have to download the rest ? or the entire game ? to the system¡¯s onboard storage, which quickly fills up. Data also can be put on a user-provided Micro SD card, but even the costly 200+ GB ones offer less total storage than, say, a basic Xbox One S or PS4 Slim.The 64 GB cartridges were originally intended to be provided in later 2018, the WSJ¡¯s source says, but that¡¯s been delayed to 2019. Not good if you were planning on shipping your epic RPG in time for next year¡¯s holidays.Could we return to the days of multiple discs for a single game? It¡¯s highly unlikely ? carts are expensive little pieces of hardware, unlike discs, and the ability to download really does solve the problem, even if you might have to clear out a few old games to make space for the new.Having so many games that you literally can¡¯t fit them all on your device is a good problem to have, at least. And it¡¯s not like you can¡¯t fit a great, gigantic game into 32 gigs ? Breath of the Wild is less than half that."
69,gadgets," Molekule, a San Francisco-based startup with a sleekly designed molecular air purifier started as an immigrant dream twenty years ago and ended up being named one of Time¡¯s top 25 inventions of 2017.The inventor?Yogi Goswami came up with the idea when his baby son Dilip started having a hard time breathing the air around him. Dilip suffered from severe asthma but no air purifier at the time seemed to work well enough to clean up indoor pollutants.Traditional HEPA filters simply trap a few pollutants but they don¡¯t grab everything and they don¡¯t break them down before releasing them back into the air.So, Goswami the elder came up with a filter technology that could both suck up things like allergens, mold and bacteria and particles up to one-thousand times smaller than what a HEPA filter can catch using photo electrochemical oxidation (PECO) and nanotechnology to destroy the pollutants on a molecular level and eliminate the full spectrum of indoor air pollutants. The result? Clean, breathable air that even the most sensitive person can handle.Dilip and his sister Jaya Goswami patented the tech and founded Molekule to bring their father¡¯s invention to the rest of us.The company now ships a stylish $800, two-foot-tall cylinder with the patented filter inside. Sure, it¡¯s a lot pricier than most filters out there but the company also offers financing at $67 a month. It was also instrumental in helping folks breathe during the Northern California wildfires this fall. Jaya mentioned Molekule¡¯s inventory was completely depleted during that time and that the company couldn¡¯t ship fast enough ? the product is still backordered till January 3rd, 2018.So far Molekule has brought in just over $13 million in venture funding to keep it going.It may be just in time as California is still dealing with wildfires elsewhere and , as global warming releases more C02 into the air, that causes more plants and flowers to release more pollen throughout the year.I visited Molekule¡¯s headquarters South of Market lately to chat with Jaya about the business and get a look at how her filter works. You can see that interview in the video above."
70,gadgets,"Amazon has acquired Blink (via Slashgear), a startup founded in 2014 that builds connected Wi-Fi home security cameras, as well as a new video doorbell introduced earlier this week. The company got its start via a crowdfunding campaign that raised over $1 million for its totally wireless home monitoring system.Amazon has already made forays into connected home video cameras and even home entry products, including its Cloud Cam and Amazon Key offering for remotely enabling access to your home for delivery people dropping off packages.What Blink brings to the table is expertise in building connected, wireless home monitoring and security tech that also operates completely wire-free requiring no complicated installation and running on simple, readily available replaceable batteries.Blink¡¯s Doorbell, for instanced, operates on two AA batteries and should last for about two years of regular use on those. That¡¯s a lot better than rival Ring¡¯s wireless doorbell in terms of battery life ? and it costs less, too, at just $99 per unit, with many similar features including motion detection, two-way audio, waterproofing and night vision.Amazon is clearly interested in owning more of the connected home space, after having tremendous success in the bourgeoning market via products like its Alexa smart speaker. This should have rivals including Ring and Alphabet-owned Nest worried, since between its own offerings and now Blink¡¯s, it has a lot to offer consumers in terms of cost and convenience benefits."
71,gadgets,"Here¡¯s an unexpected but pleasant little way tech might be able to improve a few lives: laser shoes. Yes, seriously. Shoes equipped with small laser emitters were shown in recent tests to help sufferers of Parkinson¡¯s disease to walk normally.One of the possible symptoms of Parkinson¡¯s is what¡¯s called gait freezing, where a person finds themselves unable to take a step despite willing themselves to walk forward. Being unable to move for the duration of the freeze (anything from a few seconds to over a minute) is inconvenient, but it can also cause a person to lose their balance and topple over.Interestingly, during a freeze, a person may be able to break out of it by concentrating on something near their feet that they can step towards or over, such as a floorboard or a crack in the sidewalk. Of course, such a feature is not always present. So what if you could manifest one on demand?That¡¯s the idea behind the laser shoes, imagined by the University of Twente¡¯s Murielle Ferraye: each one has a laser projection device mounted to the toe that produces a line about 18 inches ahead ? a line towards which the user can then step. The laser turns off while the shoe is in motion, so it¡¯s only ever the resting foot that projects a line.You can see them in action here:A study of 21 Parkinson¡¯s patients found that the laser shoes reduced incidents of gait freezing by nearly half, and cut the duration of those freezes by more than half. Most of the patients said they would be happy to use the shoes, and didn¡¯t mind that the line was projected even when they were not frozen. Future work, Ferraye explained in a university news release, will be aimed at activating the laser only when a freeze is detected.The research was published this week in the journal Neurology."
72,gadgets,"The days of buying devices or smart assistants will be over soon enough. Amazon and Google have both made clear their intention to make their respective AI device agnostic, so the days of the standalone Google Home or Amazon Echo might well be numbered.Assistant and Alexa are already being built into everything from thermostats to lamps. In order for smart speakers to continue to have a spot in the home, they¡¯re going to have to be speakers first, smart second. Proprietary products are already competing with offerings from big-name audio brands like Sonos, Sony and JBL. It¡¯s no surprise, then, that we¡¯ve seen Amazon, Apple and Google all head in that direction in recent months.The new Echo kind of, sort of, edges in that direction with improved audio, but the Google Home Max and Apple HomePod offer up similar visions for a future in which smart assistants are a nice bonus on a device focused on delivering high-quality, floor-rumbling, room-filling audio. And with prices approaching $400 a piece, it had better be.The Google Home Max isn¡¯t effing around here. It¡¯s big and it¡¯s heavy. The thing weighs 12 pounds. I am painfully aware of this fact because I stupidly had Google deliver it to our office, and I then threw it in a backpack to take home to test. I am currently investigating our company¡¯s worker¡¯s comp policies for the strained muscle in my back.I¡¯m a weird outlier, of course (in many ways, but let¡¯s focus on this one for now). The Home Max is very much not a portable speaker. In fact, if aesthetics dictate purpose in this case, it¡¯s practically a piece of furniture, with a fabric-covered front inline with the rest of the Google Home offerings.The Home Max isn¡¯t a flashy speaker from a design perspective. Like the rest of the Home line, the Max is designed to blend in with its surroundings. It¡¯s a boxy design that comes in black or white (charcoal or chalk, if you will). The Max is a minimalist, exchanging buttons for a simple touch panel on top, and interacting with a quartet of LED dots that shine beneath the fabric front. It¡¯s a nice-looking device; understated, really.The touch panel on top controls volume and turns the system on an off ? though on occasion I had trouble getting it to work just right. Also of note is a switch on the back of the device that disables the microphone ? a key privacy feature, though it would have been nice if the company had made it a bit more prominent the way Amazon does with the Echo line.What¡¯s perhaps most interesting from the design perspective is that Google shied away from 360-degree audio here. Pretty much every standalone smart home speaker is built that way, ditto for the HomePod. The idea here, however, is that most people don¡¯t actually plop their speakers in the middle of the room. That¡¯s certainly the case with me. I brought the Max home and found a wall to place it up against.Like the HomePod, the Max promises a customized audio footprint based on its surroundings. But instead of attempting to create some full audio picture of its surroundings, the system bases its audio fingerprint on the back wall, because much of what you¡¯re hearing is that sound reflected back at you.Google has deemed the feature ¡°Smart Sound,¡± adjusting audio equalization based on the wall. The system utilizes on-board microphones to listen to the bass as it bounces against the wall, adjusting the sound settings accordingly. According to Google, the whole process only takes a few seconds, but the system draws this out to 30 seconds in order to gradually ease into a new sound.The adjustment is subtle and fairly hard to detect. And, honestly, you probably won¡¯t be running up against this too often, given what a pain in the ass (and lower back) the system is to move.The Max sounds good. But is it $399 good? In a word, no. Given the way the smart speaker market has been playing out, I wouldn¡¯t be too surprised to see a price drop soon after the holidays ? but as it stands, the Max doesn¡¯t really live up to the expectations of such a pricey system.But it does sound good enough that many users will be perfectly happy. The audio is loud and clear, and the bass bumps like a mofo, courtesy of a pair of 4.5-inch woofers. The audio quality is solid enough the company doesn¡¯t have to sweeten things up with added bass, but the lows are pretty intense. Thankfully, you can tweak those settings to your liking through the Google Home app.The whole ¡°room filling¡± experience isn¡¯t a problem, either. Granted, I¡¯ve got a New York City apartment, so my space isn¡¯t the most¡¦ demanding, but the single Max more than did the trick and continued to sound great, even at high volumes, much to the chagrin of my poor neighbors (but those jerks knew what they were signing up for when they moved in next door to a tech writer).For those who need more than Max firepower, buying two will turn them into stereo speakers, enhancing the experience ? and driving the price up to around $800, of course.The Max is an audio-first device, but Assistant is where the system shines. In a way, it¡¯s not surprising. Assistant isn¡¯t just a platform for the company. It¡¯s the culmination of much of what the company has been working on over the past decade and a half. It¡¯s contextual search, AI and machine learning all rolled up into one. All of that helps Assistant with contextual search ? using other information to grab the right results, rather than taking a shot in the dark.It¡¯s got that leg up on Alexa, though it¡¯s still not perfect. My biggest annoyance with the system came when I was attempting to test its lyric feature. It¡¯s a cool addition to Assistant¡¯s music functionality, where you can say ¡°play me the song that goes ¡®I never thought it would happen with me and the girl from Clapham¡¯ ¡± and it will play Up the Junction by Squeeze.Or, as happened to me multiple times, it will play ¡°Play that Song¡± by Train and you¡¯ll want to toss the Max out a window, because Train is a terrible band that no one should listen to. Thankfully, it costs $399 and weights 12 pounds, so you leave it be and move on.That said, the system¡¯s voice recognition is solid, and I was impressed by its ability to recognize the ¡°OK Google¡± and ¡°Hey Google¡± commands, even when it was playing music at loud volumes. Also, kudos to Google for letting you set up a third-party music service as a default. Too often these devices are about locking users into a particular ecosystem. Here, I was able to set up Spotify out of the box (you also can use YouTube music and Pandora). So you don¡¯t have to specify that you want to play a song on a given service.If you want to play back audio from YouTube, on the other hand, you¡¯ll need a YouTube Red account. Thankfully, the speaker ships with a free 12-month plan. The least Google could do with a $399 speaker.That $399 price tag will be pretty hard for many to stomach, especially as more and more third parties come out with their own smart Assistant speakers. It says a lot that it¡¯s $50 more than Apple¡¯s premium speaker. Though the Home Max has some decided advantages over the HomePod, not the least of which is that it¡¯s actually on the market right now. Apple¡¯s offering, meanwhile, is slated for some time early next year.On the whole, it¡¯s a solid offering. Google Assistant is tough to beat and the hardware mostly stands on its own. It¡¯s not the most stellar piece of audio equipment at its price point, but Google¡¯s engineered something that works right out of the box, while Smart Sound means you won¡¯t have to do any EQ fiddling in the off-chance that you end up moving it from its current position.If you want to further customize it, that¡¯s possible, too. The Google Assistant app is much more robust than Alexa. But plug-and-play capabilities will likely appeal to many users simply looking for a nice-sounding system that also can help get them ready for work in the morning."

74,gadgets,"I¡¯ve been following the rise of standing desks for a few years now and still use one on a daily basis. The technology hasn¡¯t changed much in the decade or so that they¡¯ve become truly popular but the design and quality is always improving which is why I took a look at the Kronos Lift from BDI.This is a surprisingly elegant desk with very little visible machinery ? the motors are hidden under the table top and in the legs ? and the company has added a few solid features to this $2,100 desk that make it a solid choice for a nicer office environment.BDI makes office furniture. This is the kind of gear you¡¯d see in a nicer legal office or a funded startup. It¡¯s not quite designed for a home office unless, of course, you have a very nicely designed home office. Me, I prefer a bunch of cast-off Ikea.That said the Kronos is a nicely appointed and easy-to-use desk. There are four pre-set positions as well as a manual control that lets you go down to 29 inches and up to 54 inches. There is also a ¡°mezzanine¡± designed to hold office items or carry your monitor to place it slightly above eye level. The mezzanine has a solid back so things won¡¯t tip out when the desk moves, a plus given the austere styling of the whole kit. There is also a pull-out keyboard shelf which keeps your work surface clean.Assembly was quick except for a small snafu with the top shelf which resulted in a crack. I built it in about 30 minutes and had it up and running a minute later. There legs and motor come in easy-to-assemble pieces and all you really have to worry about is mounting the tabletop and the mezzanine. The motor is very quiet and quick, far faster and quieter than my current motorized desk.These things are getting so common that they¡¯re a commodity. Barring one model I saw that controls your Spotify remotely, you can¡¯t really ask a standing desk to do much more than get you off your butt during the day. At $2,100 you¡¯d best be sure that¡¯s what you want to do but I doubt the average home office worker will pick this one up, instead deciding to go with the primitive if charming Ikea Skarsta complete with crotch-jabbing control handle.?On second thought maybe a super-robotic high-end desk isn¡¯t so bad."
75,gadgets,"Smart speakers will likely outsell wearable devices this holiday season. That¡¯s the latest prediction from analysts at eMarketer, which forecasts a slowing growth rate for devices like fitness trackers and smartwatches here in the U.S. The wearable market is continuing to grow, to be clear, but it¡¯s struggling to reach the mainstream. Next year, only 20 percent of the U.S. adult population will use a wearable devices at least once a month, the firm says.Note that eMarketer is looking at wearable usage and market penetration here, not sales.That being said, the firm is estimating that usage of wearable will grow just 11.9 percent in 2018, rising from 44.7 million adult wearable users in 2017 to 50.1 million in 2018. As a percentage of the population, that¡¯s a climb from 17.7 percent to 19.6 percent.Things won¡¯t improved much in the next few years, either, if the forecast holds out. The growth rate will slow to single digits in 2019. By 2021, eMarketer is estimating 59.5 million adult wearable users, representing 22.6 percent of the population.The firm attributes the majority of the growth in the sector ? a market today that¡¯s dominated by fitness trackers ? to new users of smartwatches, like the Apple Watch.This news follows an earlier report where eMarketer had significantly downgraded its projections for wearable usage in the U.S. But it shouldn¡¯t come as a surprise.The relatively ¡°modest¡± growth for the wearable market overall is something other analysts have pointed to, as well. Globally, the market saw just 7.3 percent growth in Q3 2017, according to IDC, for example. Canalys had reported in August 8 percent year-over-year growth, largely thanks to Xiaomi.Gartner, meanwhile, had predicted 17 percent global growth in 2017, but counts things like Bluetooth headsets (such as AirPods), body-worn cameras, and head-mounted displays in its grouping, alongside smartwatches, fitness trackers, wristbands, and other health monitors.According to eMarketer, the problem with wearables in the U.S., and smartwatches in particular, is their high cost combined with the fact that they haven¡¯t really sold mainstream users on these being gadgets you simply can¡¯t live without.Instead, they still feel more like luxury items ? things that are nice to have, but not necessary.¡°Other than early adopters, consumers have yet to find a reason to justify the cost of a smartwatch, which can sometimes cost as much as a smartphone,¡± eMarketer forecasting analyst Cindy Liu said.? ¡°Instead, for this holiday season, we expect smart speakers to be the gift of choice for many tech enthusiasts, because of their lower price points.¡±A holiday bump in smart speaker sales is almost a certainty at this point. Amazon¡¯s top seller during the Black Friday holiday shopping weekend was the Echo Dot, for example, and Strategy Analytics recently predicted nearly 12 million smart speaker units sold in Q4 2017, bringing the year¡¯s total to 24 million units.eMarketer has also forecast 55 percent of U.S. households would have one of these devices by 2022."
76,gadgets,"There are plenty of humanoid-looking robots out there, but very few actually have bodies that are particularly analogous to our own when it comes to moving and interacting with the environment. Japanese researchers are working to remedy that with a robot designed specifically to mimic not just human movements but the way humans actually accomplish those movements. Oh, and it sweats.Kengoro is a new-ish robot (an earlier version made the rounds last year) that emphasizes flexibility and true humanoid structure rather than putting power or efficiency above all else.As the researchers explain in their paper, published today in Science Robotics:A limitation of conventional humanoids is that they have been designed on the basis of the theories of conventional engineering, mechanics, electronics, and informatics.By contrast, our intent is to design a humanoid based on human systems ? including the musculoskeletal structure, sensory nervous system, and methods of information processing in the brain ? to support science-oriented goals, such as gaining a deeper understanding of the internal mechanisms of humans.The paper uses Kengoro and similar robot, Kenshiro, as examples of how to accomplish that intent; indeed, the whole issue of Science Robotics was dedicated to the concept of improving anthropomorphic robotics.It¡¯s important, they explain, to imitate human biology wherever possible, not just where it¡¯s convenient. If your robot has powerful arms but a stiff, straight spine and no neck, that may be better for lifting heavy items ? but it just isn¡¯t how humans do it, and if human-like motion is actually desired, you essentially have to put in our weaknesses as well as our strengths.And truly human-like motion should be desired, if a robot is supposed to exist in human-centric environments and interact with people.After putting together Kengoro with muscle, joint and bone-like arrangements of motors and struts, the researchers put these similarities to the test by having the robot attempt a number of ordinary exercises, from push-ups to calf raises.All the way down! Are you a robot or a soft, weak human?Use that anger!As you can see, he¡¯s a little jittery (¡°he¡± because the robot is modeled after an average 13-year-old Japanese boy). He probably should have stretched first. Still, he probably did more crunches for this article than I did this year.The sweating thing probably deserves a little explanation. Essentially the motors have water running through them to help cool them off as they work, and they can expel that water through artificial pores in order to more quickly release heat. It¡¯s not exactly a critical feature, but if you¡¯re going to mimic humanity, you might as well go all the way.It¡¯s an interesting and unsurprisingly complex endeavor that Yuki Asano et al. are pursuing, but the results already seem worthwhile, and the applications they envision are promising. The ¡°human mimetic humanoid¡± project is ongoing, so expect more from Kengoro in the near future."
77,gadgets,"Kuri, the home robot that wants to be more companion and less Roomba, has begun shipping out to customers. Kuri creator Mayfield Robotics, a Bosch-owned startup, revealed that its initial shipments have gone out via FedEx ? which means it technically met its goal of beginning to ship the photogenic little friend bots prior to the end of 2017, if only just.Kuri was originally unveiled almost a year ago at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, and it¡¯s been steadily getting smarter and closer to production-ready status since then, with regular updates from the roboticists at Mayfield, who wanted to create a domestic robot that wasn¡¯t just functional, but that would be welcomed in as a virtual member of the family.The little robot features touch sensors, expressive eyes with a built-in camera and live-streaming capabilities, the ability to communicate via onboard speakers, microphones and gestural motion actuators, obstacle avoidance smarts and wheels that can handle room crossing from one room into another, as well as multiple types of floors and carpets.Kuri¡¯s designed to autonomously navigate the house, learn over time, automatically capture special moments, play back music, audiobooks and podcasts, and generally be a pal around the house. It¡¯s a novel and daring approach to bringing robotics into the domestic sphere ? especially given its $700 price tag. Mayfield seems to be enjoying healthy interest, however; the queue is currently set to deliver sometime next spring for reservations made today."
78,gadgets,"Erato, one of the first companies to make and sell fully wireless earbuds, has a new product available called the Verse that¡¯s more affordable than its flagship Apollo 7 buds, but with great sound quality, a lighter form factor, and innovative graphene drivers that provide quality audio with fewer compromises. The small, bullet-shaped earbuds are a good alternative for would-be AirPod customers who either don¡¯t have the right ear shape, or are looking for better sound isolation as compared to Apple¡¯s fully wireless buds.The Verse buds do have one significant flaw compared to other wireless buds ? they have an advertised battery life of just three hours of music playback, which is at least an hour less than most of the other options out there. They do come with a battery-packing case that can recharge them on the go, however, and ultimately Erato says that they¡¯ll provide up to 15 hours of playback between case and earbuds on a full charge (though you¡¯ll have to recharge the buds by stowing them every three hours or so).The case itself is actually very reminiscent of Apple¡¯s AirPods case ? it¡¯s a matte black, and a bit bigger, but it has a similar pivoting top, and even makes a sound that¡¯s an awful lot like the AirPods case click when closed. A label on the stainless steel hinge for the case¡¯s top also reads ¡°Designed by Erato in California, Assembled in China¡± in case you had any doubts about where they were getting their inspiration.As for the buds themselves, they¡¯re shaped just like the Apollo 7s, which is to say they look like bullets with rubber tips on the end, and with a small button at the wide end of each bud. The earbuds also have a matte black (or white, depending on which model you buy) finish, which makes the plastic feel higher quality. Also, they¡¯re incredibly light ? so light they feel like props rather than actual functioning electronic devices.Despite their lightness, they sound good ? and substantial. They have more bass than their Apple equivalents, and in general you¡¯ll enjoy a more full sound, made better because the ¡°spin-fit¡± silicon tips that Erato includes with the buds are much more likely to provide a stable fit in your ears.The other improvement Erato has made here is in the case ? it¡¯s far better than the one that shipped with the Apollo 7, providing a much more reliable connection with the buds themselves for charging. Its rounded edges and snap shut lid also make it a pretty fantastic fidget object, if you¡¯re into that sort of thing.Erato¡¯s offering is a strong one in the $150 price range, where it earns the honor of being the best-sounding option currently out there. If battery life was a bit better, they¡¯d be a no brainer, but as it is, you might want to consider other options if that¡¯s your most important buying criteria."
79,gadgets,"Dyson may be busy building cars these days, but it¡¯s also still making its bread and butter, including vacuums and other home appliances. The connected Pure Hot + Cold Link fan, heater and air purifier combo is one of those, and it¡¯s an awesome way to spend some of that holiday cash coming your way.It¡¯s not for everyone ? it¡¯s a $500 ($700 here in my local Canadian currency) addition to the household, after all. But it offers a unique combination of features that make it an ideal fit for anyone looking for a way to keep their houses a bit warmer during winter, a bit cooler during summer, and in general a bit more breathable in terms of overall air quality.The Pure Hot+Cool Link¡¯s features are laid out in its rather long, somewhat tongue-twisting name; it combines Dyson¡¯s air purifying tech, which extracts allergens and pollution from the air, with a built-in heater and a multi-speed fan. All of this is also connected (hence the ¡®Link¡¯), letting you connect to your home¡¯s Wi-Fi network and then control and schedule your device, and monitor the air quality remotely via the Dyson smartphone app for iPhone and Android.Dyson¡¯s app will show you the air quality condition in your house, as detected by the purifier, and represented with an easy-to-understand graphic that also optionally shows you the air quality in general in your area, provided you enter in your fan¡¯s location. It also detects humidity and temperature, and you can use its sensors to put the fan in an automatic mode that will have the fan work towards achieving an air quality goal for whatever room it¡¯s in.You can also use the app to set a schedule, and to manually control all aspects of the fan/purifier/heater, including setting a desired temperature for the heating function, increasing fan speed, or setting oscillation. It¡¯s incredibly convenient, and something you¡¯ll quickly find yourself wondering how you lived without on older, less connected fans and heaters.Other convenience features Dyson offers include an automatic night-time mode that dims all the external display lights and runs the fan at quieter settings so as not to disturb light sleepers, as well as a filter life indicator that lets you know when you need to swap yours out for a new one. And it works with Dyson¡¯s Alexa skill, so you can very easily issue voice commands to get the purifier to start or stop, or to heat to a specific temperature, for instance.Dyson also nailed the basics with this fan/purifier/heater combo ? it can move a lot of air at its stronger settings, and it puts out a surprising amount of heat, too. For smaller apartments, one is probably all you need to go from draughty to cosy in a relatively short period of time. I found I had to turn it down from what I expected to need in terms of heating a basement bedroom that¡¯s usually chilly pretty much year-round.The design of the Pure Hot+Cool Link is also an advantage in terms of comparing it to other products out there. It comes in three different colorways, but each is better looking than the average fan, heater or air purifier. It bears Dyson¡¯s signature shiny plastic, futuristic look ? but he darker color options blend into the background with relative ease, while there¡¯s an electric blue option if you¡¯re feeling like making more of a statement.Again, it¡¯s an expensive option overall (even with its current discount), but it¡¯s also typical in terms of Dyson tech as something that¡¯s put together with care and utmost attention to quality, and something you can trust to last. It¡¯s also a big improvement even over previous generation of Dyson fans in delivering airflow quietly ? even at lower settings, it heats and cools effectively, and you¡¯ll barely realize it¡¯s even on."

Understandably so ? they were fun, but weird additions to company¡¯s portfolio of smart home products. The little glowing devices finally start shipping today, priced at $20 for a two-pack, and Hasbro¡¯s offering one of the more compelling reasons to pick them up for the holidays.The buttons pair to an Echo device via bluetooth, serving as gameshow buzzers. Trivial Pursuit Tap is one of the first third-party applications to take advantage of the little plastic discs, turning the smart home speaker into a makeshift, at-home, Alexa-based gameshow. Users can connect up to four of the Buttons at once, assigning different colors to each player. It¡¯s a fun little divergence from the standard Echo line ? one that apparently started off as a bit of a pet project?and somehow made its way to retail. Given the recent surge in popularity of app-based trivia games, however, this could actually prove a bit of a dark horse success for the company, especially given their low barrier of entry.According to Amazon¡¯s site, the Buttons should arrive prior to Christmas, which makes them solid candidates for stocking stuffers, and will give the family something to do other than argue about politics and the new Star Wars after all of the presents are unwrapped. Whether or not they¡¯re stashed away in the closet come New Year¡¯s, however, is entirely dependent on whether other game companies embrace the tech.?"
83,gadgets,"The streaming box that aims to bring sanity to your streaming world by combining all your streaming hardware sources into one will ship on Valentine¡¯s Day next year, according to The Verge. Caavo offers a solution to a very modern problem ? making it easy to switch between devices including your DVR, your Roku, your Apple TV, your PS4 and other devices seamlessly, using one remote and a single interface.It uses a modified version of Android to unify all these disparate sources, and automatically switches to whichever device contains the content you¡¯re looking for when you want to watch it. You can set different defaults for various services, including Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime, in case you find that one or another of your devices is better at streaming that particular service than another (or it¡¯s only available in one place).The Caavo can support up to eight inputs, with 4K resolution ? but it has one major limitation that might be a deal-breaker for the kind of home theater nut who¡¯s likely to need something like what the Caavo offers in the first place: It doesn¡¯t support HDR.Caavo¡¯s retail price is $400, which is, if you¡¯re counting, double the price of an Apple TV or Shield TV, which are themselves already considerably more expensive than a Roku or Amazon Fire TV streamer. The startup is betting that there are enough customers out there willing to spend on individual devices like an Xbox and PS4, as well as an Apple TV and a traditional TV subscription that also crave an added level of convenience vs. what you¡¯d get from a universal remote like those offered by Logitech. That¡¯s a very big, very questionable bet.Honestly, there¡¯s probably no way this boondoggle of a product succeeds. But the company¡¯s ambition and technology could still have promise, and per The Verge, it¡¯s already looking at what else it might make, perhaps in a more affordable price range."
84,gadgets,"Before the eclipse this summer, NASA warned us over and over again not to stare directly at the sun ? but now they¡¯re doing just that. Its researchers have reinvented a photography technique more than a century old, using the sun itself as a backdrop in order to capture the shockwave produced by a new supersonic jet.Schlieren imaging was invented by a German physicist in the 19th century as a way to capture objects moving at supersonic speeds; it basically works by tracking tiny distortions to a uniform background illumination that are produced when the air is disturbed by a passing object.The results are striking and you¡¯ve likely seen them before. But traditional Schlieren imaging is limited in its range and scale; NASA¡¯s Background Oriented Schlieren using Celestial Objects (BOSCO) allows the sun itself to be used as the background, and, not only that, it¡¯s reliable enough to be used from a chaser plane 10,000 feet up.Another Schlieren photo from NASA that uses the edge of the sun as its uniform background; BOSCO uses the disc itselfPrevious background-oriented Schlieren imaging efforts for viewing the distortion patterns of planes in flight have been shot top-down with a featureless landscape as their background, or bottom-up using the edge of the sun (as you see above). But BOSCO aims its telescopic camera directly at the disc of the sun, capturing the aircraft as it causes a partial, highly local eclipse.In order not to be completely blown out, the camera system uses a ¡°hydrogen alpha filter,¡± which only lets in a very specific wavelength of light, which is produced by the sun in a nice granular pattern.You can see it in action in this video, which does double duty to remind you that much science is done in circumstances that are decidedly less than glorious but nevertheless awesome:How cool is that? (Although I do have to say that aesthetically speaking, the smooth gradients of film photography better suit this type of imagery.)Don¡¯t try this at homeThey¡¯re not just doing this for fun, though. BOSCO is part of NASA¡¯s Quiet Supersonic Technology program, which aims (as you might have guessed already) to create a supersonic aircraft that doesn¡¯t create that vexing sonic boom wherever it goes. Such a craft could help bring back consumer supersonic flight, and would even be able to do overland routes.The future Low Boom aircraft would likely fly at around 60,000 feet, though, but since it would be difficult for a ground-based system to capture good shots of a plane flying that high, the team needed to create something that create this kind of imagery from the air.So the latest development is the deployment of a new, miniaturized BOSCO that can fit into the wing pod of a chaser aircraft. This lets the researchers capture images from as close as 10,000 feet, while the target plane is actually flying at the target altitude.¡°The main objective here was to see what the image looks like at close range, including what kind of shockwave structure we can make out,¡± said BOSCO principal investigator Mike Hill in a NASA news release. ¡°We needed to use our new compact camera system in order to get an idea of the quality of the images of those shockwaves using a smaller system.¡±The new setup is what was being tested in the video above; the flight you see was at 20,000 feet, but subsequent ones were at 15,000 and 10,000 feet, proving that the technique works at the range likely to be encountered during an air-to-air shoot.Of course, getting a clear shot of one supersonic jet from the wing of a second is a major challenge in and of itself ? but at least they know the camera works."
85,gadgets,"I got excited when the Echo Spot debuted. At the time, I tentatively declared it the best Echo at the time, and after living with the device for the better part of a week, my sentiments haven¡¯t really changed.The latest member of the Echo family slots into the line nicely, delivering the Show¡¯s touchscreen functionality at a much more palatable price point and size. It¡¯s kind of the Dot to the Show¡¯s standard Echo ? in other words, ¡°Spot¡± is what you get when you cross ¡°Show¡± with ¡°Dot.¡±While rumors about a touchscreen Google Home have been floating around for a bit, the Echo line is still the only major player in the space with the functionality ? making Amazon its own biggest competitor. And honestly, I wouldn¡¯t be surprised if the Spot starts eating into Show sales in a big way. A few case uses aside, there really aren¡¯t that many reasons to plunk down the extra $100 for the Show.The biggest change in this most recent round of Echo devices is the fact that Amazon¡¯s actually started to give a crap about design. The Echos were kind of crummy and plasticky looking, betraying a company that was more interested in getting its platforms into the home, rather than actually blending in with them.The Echo got a nice design makeover, with fabric covers and the like, and likewise, the Spot is a much better looking device than the Show. The first Echo was big and plasticky and clunky, with all sorts of weird, brutalist angles.The Spot¡¯s a small, half-circle, available in either white or black. The company likely could sell even more if it offered them in a wider variety of colors, but between the two current options, it should fit pretty well into most settings. It¡¯s not bleeding-edge design, but it¡¯s minimal without being boring and is honestly pretty nice looking, so far as alarm clocks go.An Amazon rep tells me the circular design wasn¡¯t chosen for any particular practical purpose ? it was a purely aesthetic decision. There is, however, one big downside to all of that: it really messes with video playback. It¡¯s pretty clear that Amazon didn¡¯t expect too many people to actually watch video on the thing. The screen is 2.5 inches, to the Show¡¯s seven.When you attempt to watch a video, a big portion of the screen is taken over by big, black letter boxing, adding the already sizable bezel. When the video pops up, there¡¯s an option for zooming in. That will eliminate the letter boxing problem, but you¡¯re going to lose everything on the periphery. It¡¯s a weird sensation ? a bit like watching something through a porthole.Of course, on top of the size and dimensional constraints is the fact that the screen has a 480 x 480 resolution. That means it¡¯s not great for much beyond playing short videos ? and, unfortunately, bickering between Amazon and Google means when you ask Alexa to ¡°play YouTube,¡± she answers, curtly that ¡°web videos are not supported on this device.¡± Amazon video does have some short form content, but it¡¯s no YouTube. Because nothing is YouTube, except for YouTube.Similarly, the speakers, which were a key focus on the new Echo and Echo Plus, are nothing to speak of, or hear. The get surprisingly loud, but like the Dot, you¡¯re not going to want to use them for much more than communicating with Alexa. For music playback and the like, there¡¯s an audio out port on the back, Bluetooth playing and multi-room music streaming ? in other words, you have plenty of much better options for listening to music through Alexa.Amazon designs these device around where they¡¯re intended to be used in the home. And yes, the closest non-smart analog for the Spot is the alarm clock. I had it next to my bed for most of my time with the device. It¡¯s a good size and shape for a nightstand, and mornings are really the most useful time of day for an Echo ? it¡¯s when you¡¯re looking for useful bits of info like the weather, traffic and news ? the latter of which the Spot delivers as flash briefings. Those are short little news videos from top video providers. Pick, say, TechCrunch, to choose a totally arbitrary example, and it will play Crunch Report.About a week or so back, Amazon brought alarm clock functionality to the Echo line ? the timing was a surefire sign that the Spot was just over the horizon. Ask Alexa to, say, ¡°Wake me up to Thin Lizzy at 6:00AM tomorrow,¡± and the device will do just that, pulling songs from Amazon Prime. You also can ask it to wake you to radio stations through Tune-In. Handy feature that.Of course, releasing a device designed to live by the side of your bed really stirs up all of those smart speaker privacy issues we¡¯ve been talking about for a few weeks. As ever, the Echo is always listening, and while the company has added security precautions to ease users¡¯ minds, things get even more tricky when you add a camera into the picture.As with the rest of the Echo line, there¡¯s a button on top that turns off the microphone, lighting up a red circle around the display to let you know that it¡¯s no longer listening. There¡¯s no voice command to turn the mic off (likely because you then wouldn¡¯t be able to turn it back on with a similar command), but turning off the video camera is accomplished by voice. Strangely, there¡¯s no equivalent to the red ring here. Alexa just cheerfully lets you know that the camera¡¯s off and she¡¯ll turn it back on tomorrow.Amazon should make this functionality more straightforward in future versions. The company should also consider selling a camera-free model. Honestly, aside from video calling, there aren¡¯t a ton of applications for the feature, so many users likely wouldn¡¯t even miss it.One of the nicest things about the Echo line is the speed with which the company is adding new skills. As of December 2017, Alexa¡¯s ecosystem is a fairly robust one. Though, these screen models are relatively new additions, so the selection of visual tools is still a bit lacking at the moment. With most of the more basic skills, like weather and traffic, the company¡¯s done a decent job creating static images.That said, there are still some solid skills that make good use of the screen, like the aforementioned video calling. The most compelling, however, is probably smart home camera and baby monitor functionality. The device is compatible with a wide range of devices from big names, like Arlo, August, Nest and Ring. It¡¯s handy having a little screen nearby for checking in when someone¡¯s at the door.I like the Spot. If I was current in the market for an Echo device, this would probably be the one. It¡¯s one of the better looking members in the line and the $129 price seems just about right. The display¡¯s usefulness is hampered somewhat by size and a relative lack of skills that really take advantage of the tech, but it does bring some nice functionality to the table.As with all of these devices, I recommend that anyone who¡¯s in the market does a cost benefit analysis of the useful features versus privacy concerns. All of that is compounded when you stick the product in a bedroom and add a camera. Amazon¡¯s got ways of disabling all of that, but I¡¯m strongly considering becoming one of those blue electric tape people and covering the thing up most of the time ? there just aren¡¯t that many applications for a built-in camera.If none of this seems particularly concerning to you, however, the Spot quickly shoots up the list of available Echos. It¡¯s a nice addition to the line, and Amazon¡¯s about to sell a whole lot of these."
86,gadgets,"Amazon¡¯s Echo lineup got a refresh earlier this year that included a brand new version of its basic Echo, well as an Echo Plus with integrated smart home hub, and the stalwart Echo Dot ? unchanged, but still a compelling device at its price point.The new lineup of devices also made its way to more markets this year, including an expansion to Canada just this month, which is why I now have a host of Echo hardware kitting out my apartment. The major accomplishment of this refresh, I think, is that it feels less like a new generation of gadget, and more like a coming of age for a modern-day appliance ? a whole new category of must-have home furnishings.Amazon clearly wants to encourage this impression ? the new Amazon Echo comes in a host of fabric-covered finishes, and it¡¯s hard to imagine the upholstery look¡¯s connection to furnishings is unintentional. Part of it is about fitting into the decor so that these smart speakers can stand free and clear and unhidden on shelves, tables and surfaces without offending any sensibilities. But it¡¯s also about turning a gadget into something far more approachable, and far more mainstream.As far as I¡¯m concerned, Amazon has accomplished its task. The Echo (and Echo Plus, and Echo Dot), have all become as key a home device as a light switch, or a couch, or a microwave. The latest generation just firms up that presence with needed improvements in key areas, including in sound reproduction (the new Echo is better than its predecessor, for sure, and the Echo Plus seems to sound a bit better as well despite having apparently similar hardware).I now use the Echos around the house to control my Hue lights (I don¡¯t remember the last time I flicked a switch), turn on and control the home theater system, check and change the temperature using my Nest thermostat, check news and weather and set kitchen timers. It¡¯s second-nature at this point, and doing the same things, the old, manual way feels hopelessly backwards ? even if the actual convenience difference is arguably trivial.Aspects of the new Echo lineup are questionable, like the integrated smart home hub in the Echo Plus which only supports one of the two major standards for wireless connected home devices. But they don¡¯t detract from the experience ? and the ultimate impression that Echo is a home companion that¡¯s destined to become more and more a default option that people live with as reliably as they do their coffee table, or at least their dishwasher."
87,gadgets,"The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) issued a warning against the hazards of cellphone radiation this week. Yes, the thing we are all addicted to and can¡¯t seem to put down is leaking electromagnetic radiation and now California has some guidance to safeguard the public.The CDPH asks people to decrease their use of these devices and suggests keeping your distance when possible.¡°Although the science is still evolving, there are concerns among some public health professionals and members of the public regarding long-term, high use exposure to the energy emitted by cell phones,¡± said CDPH director Dr. Karen Smith.The warning comes after findings were offered up this week from a 2009 department document, which was published after an order from the?Sacramento Superior Court.A year ago,?UC Berkeley professor?Joel Moskowitz initiated a lawsuit to get the department to release the findings after he started looking into whether mobile phone use increased the risk of tumors.A draft of the document was released in March, but the final release is more extensive.¡°The cellphone manufacturers want you to keep a minimum distance away from your body and you should find out what that distance is,¡± Moskowitz told local news station KCRA, shortly after the draft release. ¡°If you keep the device by your body you will exceed the safety limits provided by the FCC.¡±According to the Federal Communication Commission¡¯s website, there is no national standard developed for safety limits. However, the agency requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure all phones comply with ¡°objective limits for safe exposure.¡±The CDPH?recommends not keeping your phone in your pocket, not putting it up to your ear for a prolonged amount of time, keeping use low if there are two bars or less, not sleeping near it at night and to be aware that if you are in a fast-moving car, bus or train, your phone will emit more RF energy to maintain the connection.Other organizations have warned of the dangers of cell phone radiation exposure as well, including the Connecticut Department of Public Health, which issued similar recommendations in May of 2015.However, Moskowitz maintains most?state and federal health agencies have not kept up with the research. ¡°The preponderance of the research indicates that cell phone radiation poses a major risk to health,¡± he said in a statement."
88,gadgets,"It¡¯s one thing for an autonomous car to strut its stuff on a smooth, warm California tarmac, and quite another to do so on the frozen winter mix of northern Finland. Martti, a self-driving vehicle system homegrown in Finland, demonstrated just this in a record-setting drive along a treacherous (to normal drivers) Laplandish road.Martti is one of two cars designed by VTT Technical Research Center; it¡¯s designed to handle rough and icy conditions, while its ¡°spouse¡± Marilyn is made for more ordinary urban drives. Different situations call for different sensors and strategies ? for instance, plain optical cameras perform poorly on snowy roads, and lidar is less effective, so Martti will rely more on radar. But Marilyn has a rear-mounted lidar for better situational awareness in traffic.Recently Martti accomplished what the researchers claim is a world first: driving fully autonomously on a real snow-covered road (and hitting 25 MPH, at that). Others from Yandex to Waymo have tested cars in snow, but from their reports these seem to have been more controlled conditions. Martti¡¯s drive took place in Muonio on a public road almost totally obscured by snow.¡°It probably also made a new world record in fully automated driving, making 40 km/h in a snowfall on snow-covered terrain without lane markings,¡± said project manager Matti Kutila in a VTT news release. ¡°It could have had even more speed, but in test driving it is programmed not to exceed the limit of 40 km/h.¡±I¡¯m not sure going any faster would be wise even on straightaways. But winter driving isn¡¯t my specialty.The point isn¡¯t to make a perfect consumer car for snowy weather, but to tackle the unique technical problems pertaining to it. For instance, can Martti¡¯s optical instruments tweak the wavelength they use depending on conditions in order to gain a small but significant increase in accuracy? What about detecting icy conditions and traction problems ahead of time ? how should the car collect this data, and how should it act until it¡¯s sure what to do?Inter-car networks may be critical for this, the researchers suggested, including both other autonomous cars on the road and specialty vehicles that can test for and broadcast information like snow pack, traction, road temperature and so on.Ultimately this intelligence could prove highly useful for applications like self-driving tractors, logging trucks or emergency vehicles.Soon the team will be going even deeper into the Nordic environment: ¡°Next spring one of our vehicles can also be spotted in forest environments, when Marilyn and Martti get a new friend capable of tackling all terrains.¡±"
89,gadgets,"It¡¯s refreshing to wear a mechanical watch. The soft sweep of the seconds hand reminds us of the fleeting nature of time while the endless ticking in a dark room is a comfort and a spur to action. Add in a little limited edition provenance with big face and crown and you¡¯ve got a stew going.This particular stew is called the Alpina Startimer. It is a pilot¡¯s watch, a watch with a large face and huge numerals used by old-timey fighter pilots during World War II. Designed with a huge crown which, as William Gibson wrote, ¡°is rather more than usually prominent, so that you can do it without removing your whacking great RAF pilot¡¯s gloves,¡± the pilot¡¯s watch is the ultimate in utilitarian wrist-wear. You don¡¯t admire a pilot¡¯s watch, you address it for a split second while preparing to take Gs in a barrel roll.This particular model is made by Alpina, a smaller Swiss manufacturer that has long specialized in a larger, bolder watch. The $1,150 piece runs a AL-525 movement which is based on the Sellita SW200. This is a Swiss movement that is, to a degree, mass-produced and is considered a workhorse in the watch world. It is part of their Startimer line but features special design cues and a limited edition engraving.This piece is a commemorates Michael Goulian Aerosports, a stunt aerosports team that, we learn, straps these things to their wrists and whizzes around obstacles. The watch ¡°is presented in a special edition box alongside a miniature model of Michael Goulian¡¯s Red Bull Air Race World Championship competition airplane¡± and is aimed at fans of little planes that go really fast.What¡¯s special about this watch? Well, it¡¯s a nicely made automatic watch at a price point that is on par with other entry-level pieces in the space. It has great lume ? the numerals and hands glow in the dark making it very readable ? and the band is a little thin but well-made. If you particularly like this mix of red, black, and titanium it¡¯s a definite keeper.I, for one, prefer either a steel or dark PVD pilot¡¯s watch. All the bright metal on this piece is a bit distracting and takes away from the utilitarian nature of the original pilot¡¯s watches. The traditional pilots watch also has broadarrow hands ? IWC makes one that is a good example of the standard design ? and the decision to add thinner hands to this piece is a bit incongruous.I wore it off and on for a week and found it to be very readable and very precise. Watches slow down over time but this one managed to keep solid time over seven days with an average loss of a few minutes by the time my test was over. Again, you don¡¯t buy these sorts of things to maintain atomic accuracy, you buy them to be reminded of a simpler time in aviation history.Ultimately when it comes to a piece like this you¡¯re buying quality and then design. The quality is there as Alpina has been making solid, dependable watches for decades. The design is subjective and if you¡¯re into a ¡°rather more than usually prominent¡± crown with a bold, handsome face then you could do worse for yourself. Now all you have to do is buy yourself some whacking great RAF pilot¡¯s gloves and you¡¯ll be set to take to the skies."
90,gadgets,"TGiven that there was such an appetite for a beefier computer in this pocket of hardware, and given that it was already in motion to re-think the Mac Pro entirely, Apple decided to see exactly how ridiculous it could get with iMac performance inside what is essentially the exact same shell as the current machines ? with a nice coat of color treatment and a few additional cosmetic differences.You may recall that back in April of this year, Apple was abnormally candid about its failures with the Mac Pro. It had painted itself into a corner with that design, and needed to go back to step one to rethink its approach. During that session, Apple executives told a roundtable that they were also rethinking what it meant to be a professional customer of Macs.¡°First of all, when we talk about pro customers, it¡¯s important to be clear that there isn¡¯t one prototypical pro customer. Pro is such a broad term, and it covers many many categories of customers. And we care about all of these categories, and there¡¯s a variety of different products those customers want,¡± says Schiller.?¡°There¡¯s music creators, there¡¯s video editors, there¡¯s graphic designers ? a really great segment with the Mac. There¡¯s scientists, engineers, architects, software programmers ? increasingly growing, particularly our App development in the app store. So there are many many things and people called pros, Pro workflows, so we should be careful not to over simplify and say ¡®Pros want this¡¯ or ¡®don¡¯t want that¡¯ ? it¡¯s much more complex than that.¡°Apple iMac ProSchiller said that 15% of Mac customers use professional apps multiple times a week and 30% use them in some manner. And the large majority of those pros use MacBooks. However, the iMac was beginning to be disproportionately used by pros who either found the screens or form factor compelling or found the pace of updates of the Mac Pro stagnant.¡°So many of our customers were moving to iMac that we saw a path to address many, many more of those that were finding themselves limited by Mac Pro through a next generation iMac,¡± said Apple¡¯s Craig Federighi, ¡°And [we] really put a lot of our energy behind that. [But,] while that [upgraded iMac] system is going to be fantastic for a huge number of customers ? we want to do more.¡±That more will be the upcoming Mac Pro. But the now is the iMac Pro ? a machine that will hold an allure for pros looking for a beefy piece of hardware that can handle demanding tasks from rendering to medical imaging to VR ? but that also holds some clues for the future of all of Apple¡¯s Macs.I was able to see the iMac Pro and its new space grey accessories in New York yesterday, along with a series of demos from pros that Apple seeded with the machines for a few days to allow them to get a feel for what kinds of gains they would see from it.The machine itself is physically a near match for the current iMac, aside from the dark grey finish.The rear ports are definitely different, of course. You have 4 Thunderbolt 3 ports, which run on two separate controllers, 2 ports each. So you should get blazing speeds on those whether they¡¯re used for e-GPUs or storage or displays. There are 4 USB 3.0 A ports and an SD slot and, for the first time ever, a 10 gigabit Ethernet port right on the back.The 5k display is the same as the one that ships with current iMacs. You can order 1, 2 and 4 Terabyte SSD options with the new machine for storage.Another change is the fact that you can now remove the stand from the iMac entirely and VESA mount it. Previously, you had to either use an after-market solution to mount an iMac or order it specially from the factory with the stand deleted, allowing for mounting.Apple iMac Pro backNot every configuration of the iMac Pro will be available to order today online and in stores next week. You¡¯ll be able to get the 8 and 10-core Intel Xeon W versions of the machine with any other memory, graphics or storage options you like, but the 14- and 18-core editions are coming in January. Each has 1MB of L2 and 1.365MB of L3 cache.To be clear: you can order any options the iMac offers today, except for the two higher-core processors. This, it turns out, is not that big of a limitation as the 10-core should really be the sweet spot anyway. The 10-core model offers the highest turbo speeds at 4.5GHz for single threaded performance and supports hyper threading, allowing 20 threads at a time to operate on tasks. This is enough to enable real-time playback on an 8k Red Weapon footage file in ProRes 4¡¿4, for instance ? or a 140 track Logic file.The higher-core options are really best suited for applications that take full advantage of so many lower frequency cores. Machine learning or AI applications that use the multiple CPU cores to schedule jobs for the GPUs, for instance, or rendering pipelines for external GPUs now supported by iMac.Apple iMac Pro cameraIf you¡¯re not sure what to order, go 10-core. You¡¯ll be able to jack the memory up to 128GB (non upgradeable by users, but upgradeable at a service center or store) and get the beefier Vega 64 graphics cards offered to end up with an incredibly impressive machine.The Vega 56 and 64 options are absolutely the most powerful graphics cards that have ever been included in a Mac and I was able to see demanding VR applications, rendering tasks and real-time manipulation of 3D and video that would be completely impossible on any other iMac hardware ? and would chug on the relatively beefy PC I use for VR currently.These new processors support AVX-512 instructions as well, which will give developer users of multi-core iMac Pros a nice ¡°free¡± performance bump if they¡¯re using Apple libraries (or manually calling the instructions themselves).The most interesting piece of hardware from an overall perspective, however, isn¡¯t the more exotic graphics or processor options, but a system controller chip called the T2.The T2 is an iteration of the T1 chips that are in current MacBooks, but it brings more functions of the machine into the fold. It controls the ISP that runs the 1080p camera, the audio controller including the 4 microphones and the louder speakers, the SSD controller and, importantly, the Secure Enclave that¡¯s included in the iMac Pro.The SE handles real-time automatic encryption for the SSD. This means hardware-based encryption with zero hit on the CPU, something that was always a compromise of FileVault. If your SSD is separated from the SE it cannot be read. If you want an additional layer of protection, you can also still use FileVault to inject your user key into the mix, preventing target disk access.The T2 also validates the entire boot process (an option that can be disabled) from start to finish, preventing injection attacks at a physical access level.The T2¡¯s additional layers of security are absolutely coming to the rest of the Mac line. That¡¯s a personal prediction, by the way; Apple wouldn¡¯t say. But duh. It struck me, though, that this beefier security which has built-in protections against sophisticated attackers, would be very popular in government or research applications. If I¡¯m a buyer with security-heightened needs, issa bulk buy, imo.Which brings us to the real question.The demos that Apple had lined up tell the tale of who they¡¯re pitching this machine to. Four different VR applications, several render-heavy workflows that were upgraded from minutes or hours of waiting to real-time on the iMac Pro, and a session with a bunch of simultaneous multi-device simulators running on top of browser tests running in emulators of Windows and OS X machines all while compiling Linux from source ? and nary a fan was heard spinning up.Survios showed off Electronauts, its music creation/rhythm game hybrid on a Vive, which added support via Steam earlier this year. Using a full-fledged VR application from one of the best developers in the field on a Mac was a treat. I¡¯ve run VR systems on my iMac and it has never been a pleasant experience. Sitting at my desk now I have an entire PC tower just to the right of my legs almost solely to support the multiple headsets I run. It will be great to be able to move back to a single machine for gaming and VR for me. But, more importantly, the iMac Pro is now suddenly a viable option for VR developers.This becomes important in mixed-pipeline environments, pointed out Oluwaseyi Sosanya of 3D design tool Gravity Sketch. Because they¡¯re super focused on supporting the automotive industry, they¡¯re used to designers having to leave the Mac to jump to their modeling tools and then back to the Mac where they love to design. The iMac Pro plugs that gap and makes it easier for designers to adopt digital modeling tools that would normally have relied on a PC workflow being inserted into the process.Some folks from Cinema 4D were on hand to talk about stacking external GPUs onto the Thunderbolt arrays, ramping up and down on the complexity of a scene, enabling them to work in real rendered viewports which took only a few seconds to get a usable frame and a few minutes to display at production quality ? something that would normally require shipping off to a render farm and waiting.Real-time and near-real-time rendering of architectural scenes, medical imaging and digital compositing also showed off the machine¡¯s power.OsiriX MDThe messaging was interesting to me. It was absolutely, clearly, a love letter to developers. Most of the Mac and iOS developers I know use iMacs or MacBook Pro machines ? especially given the limited nature of the Mac Pro as it exists now. And given that Apple says the Mac Pro will focus on ¡®modularity¡¯, I think that the iMac Pro is going to be one of the most powerful integrated machines of its generation.There¡¯s nothing here that recommends waiting for a software developer. I really believe that the Mac Pro will fall much more on the industrialized spectrum than in previous generations. The pricing is comparable to build-your-own options, and you don¡¯t get Apple¡¯s all-in-one system tricks like the T2. And while the price tag is nothing to joke about ? $4,999 to start ? it¡¯s a drop in the bucket for the medical and professional industries. A $700 seat of OsiriX and an iMac Pro to stack slices of a CAT scan into a real-time 3D model of a vascular system in distress is nothing to a surgeon looking for more precision.And, of course, Apple¡¯s own data supports that there was a chunk of open air underneath the Mac Pro, even at its newest.All of the benchmarks and real-world stress tests will follow to tell us exactly how well the iMac Pro pays off on its promises, but so far it¡¯s looking like Apple has a powerful new machine to plug its leaky Pro hole."
91,gadgets,"The Google Assistant, Google¡¯s take on Siri, Cortana and Alexa without the approachable name, has long been available on most modern phones and tablets. But given the fragmentation of the Android ecosystem, many older devices will never get the newer versions of Android that actually feature built-in support for the Assistant. Now, however, Google is bringing support for its voice-activated helper to phones running Android 5.0 Lollipop and tablets running Android 7.0 Nougat and 6.0 Marshmallow.Lollipop launched back in 2014, so we¡¯re talking about a rather old phone operating system here (Android 8.1 is now standard on Google¡¯s own Pixel phones), but according to Google, more than 26 percent of all Android devices still run some version of Android 5.0 Lollipop. Just over 30 percent run Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Still, with an update to the Google Play Services, even these older devices will now get access to all the goodies that the Google Assistant promises ? and often delivers.If you still own one of these older Lollipop phones, you should see an update relatively soon. It¡¯ll only be available to users who set their language to English in the U.S., U.K., India, Australia, Canada and Singapore, as well as to those who have set their default language to Spanish in the U.S., Mexico and Spain. Google says it will also roll out to users in Italy, Japan, Germany, Brazil and Korea.Because the Assistant on these older devices isn¡¯t baked right into the launcher, though, you¡¯ll have to launch the Google Assistant app before you can ask your phone for directions, the weather, recipes or jokes (in case you are feeling sad).As for Marshmallow and Nougat tablet users, they¡¯ll get the update over the course of the coming week, as long as they are in the U.S. and have set their language to English."

93,gadgets,"Apple announced a substantial investment in Finisar. Apple is giving Finisar $390 million to build a new 700,000-square-foot manufacturing plant in Sherman, Texas. Finisar is going to hire 500 people to work on the laser sensor in the TrueDepth camera in the iPhone X.Today¡¯s investment is part of Apple¡¯s commitment to invest $1 billion in U.S.-based companies with its Advanced Manufacturing Fund.Apple says that Finisar is going to work on both research & development and high-volume production of optical communications components. The most complicated components are the vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) used in the iPhone X for Face ID, Animoji, Portrait mode and other face-mapping technologies. But Finisar also works on proximity sensors including the ones in the AirPods.And it¡¯s quite easy to understand why Apple is investing in Finisar. There are simply not enough suppliers in this field today. In the fourth quarter of 2017 alone, the company will purchase 10 times more VCSEL wafers than the entire VCSEL?production in the world during the fourth quarter of 2016. So Apple needs to foster production.The new facility should be up and running at some point during the second half of 2018."
94,gadgets,"TI tested these headphones in a way that I thought they would be most widely used. I pitted them against several competitors using my iPhone 8 with Spotify. I also used an Onkyo stereo receiver with a Audio Technica turntable to test their upper limit. It was an enjoyable afternoon.Before we get started, it¡¯s important to note that I¡¯m not a professional audio reviewer. I don¡¯t have balanced power cables or a selection of FLAC tracks dedicated to testing equipment. But I do have a nice collection of headphones and a rather shitty taste in music. I don¡¯t like a lot so I listen to the same stuff over and over. That¡¯s annoying for passengers on road trips but handy when testing headphones.The Shinola Canfields are the company¡¯s first set of headphones. They¡¯re built overseas, and tested in Detroit where Shinola also puts together watches and constructs leather goods. These come from America. Kind of. Let¡¯s back up.Shinola is a watch company born from the minds behind Fossil and launched as a marketing scheme out of Plano, Texas. The company set up shop in Detroit where it starting assembling quartz watches, adopting the Made In Detroit tagline. Later the company expanded to leather goods, bikes, and other products including turntables and now headphones.Here¡¯s the kicker: Shinola headphones are much like Shinola watches. They look fantastic. They¡¯re heavy, solid, and feel like they¡¯ll last a lifetime. They¡¯re not worth the price. The appeal stops at the casing. The insides, much like Shinola watches, are comprised of low-end components, not worthy of the lofty price tag.IClassic rock is a great place to start with headphone reviews. First, the music is amazing, but second there¡¯s generally a range of instruments with great soundstage separation.?Carry on Wayward Son starts with a beautiful harmony of vocals followed by a couple quick hits on the snare and guitars. Through the $600 Canfields, the vocals are muddled together where on the $449 Audeze Sine headphones the soundstage opens up and there¡¯s distinct separation that¡¯s simply beautiful.The dull vocals are even more evident in Pink Floyd¡¯s?Wish you Were Here. I have the original vinyl and it¡¯s of course on Spotify, too, making it a great test track. The intro is long and classic Pink Floyd but it¡¯s telling as a sample. Here I used the Audeze Sine headphones and the Massdrop-made Sennheiser HD 6XX headphones and the difference is stunning. Details are simply missing when the track is listened to through the Shinola headphones. The Shinola headphones did not reproduce David Gilmour¡¯s smoker?coughs and sniffles during the song¡¯s intro; one cough sounds like shuffling papers. The sounds are clearly audible through the other headphones. When Gilmour finally starts playing, the Audeze headphones produce a stunningly clear guitar twang where the Canfields fall flat.When this track is played through the turntable and amp, the differences are magnified. While the Shinola headphones sound better than when used with amp, the Sennheisers sound exponentially better and this track, and others like it, come alive.Even when compared to Bose Quiet Comfort 35s, the Shinola Canfields come up short. The Bose headphones have a notoriously small range, but I use them a lot. I¡¯m on a plane every few weeks. I put up with middle-of-the-road range because the noise cancelation is the best available. I threw Green Day on the turntable and loaded it on Spotify and found yet again, the Shinola headphones did not live up to their price.I never found a music genre where the Canfields lived comfortably though they fared better with hip-hop than most. They do not have the soundstage or highs required by classic rock and jazz is a sloppy mess. It was hip-hop where they finally started sounding the part.I turned on Flint¡¯s homegrown Bootleg of the Dayton Family and the bassline surprised me. It was full though lacking the sheer power found in other headphones. Yet despite the lower power, the Shinola headphones were fine. I guess. It¡¯s kind of hard to mess up hip-hop if the bass line is sufficient.The Canfields stand out in one way, though. They look and feel amazing. They¡¯re made out of leather, lambskin and stainless steel. The earpads are interchangeable and the headphones comfortably fit my big head.The cans themselves are solid and thanks to the stainless steel are cool to the touch. These headphones feel like $600 headphones; I just wish they sounded like $600 headphones.TThe sub-par performance could be overlooked if the price was more in line with other fashion headphones. At $600 these headphones are competing in the same space as products from Audeze, Master and Dynamic, and Grado ? which is a fantastic family owned business out of Brooklyn in case there¡¯s interest in supporting American-made products like Shinola.I can¡¯t see any reason to buy the Shinola Canfields besides the look.

You can¡¯t buy a Renault car with Devialet speakers just yet, but there¡¯s a Renault concept car with those speakers.Devialet has always said that it wasn¡¯t just a speaker manufacturer. The French startup has worked on its own amplification technology. It is supposed to be much better than everything else out there when it comes to building powerful-yet-compact speakers.The company first partnered with Sky to build a surround sound TV speaker. And now, Devialet wants to be in your car.Renault has been demonstrating its Symbioz concept car as the future of autonomous, connected and electric cars. And it seemed like a good playing ground to show off Devialet¡¯s technology.First, Devialet isn¡¯t using traditional in-door speakers and subwoofers. The company relies on tiny sound modules that are six times smaller than traditional car speakers.Second, the company uses empty spaces and pipes and makes them vibrate, creating a network of passive speakers to immerse yourself in the music.Finally, the startup also has some custom software features to route the sound to the right speaker. Passive speakers can be used for background sounds while sound modules can take care of the rest.This sounds nice on paper, so let¡¯s hope that Renault is going to bring this technology to production vehicles. It¡¯s clear that Devialet wants to go beyond putting its brand on regular speakers. The company wants to control the entire audio experience."

Why not get a head start with the MakeX Migo backpack that lets you carry your ultra-small 3D printer anywhere you need to go?This wild, see-through backpack is designed to hold a Migo 3D Printer (the thing MakeX is actually trying to sell). The backpack fits the Migo perfectly and offers the maximum visibility for your 3D printer thanks to the clear hardshell outer casing.The printer itself is fairly standard. It prints ABS or PLA plastic and includes modeling software. It weighs about 4 pounds and has a 100x120x100 mm build envelope which means you can print things like smaller action figures and other fun models. Early birds get the printer for $219 and backpack will be a $70 add-on.3D printers are essentially commodities but by adding wacky but endearing things like this fun backpack the makers are really taking 3D printing to the next ? and not-so-obvious ? level."

The keylogger is deactivated by default but could represent a privacy concern if an attacker has physical access to the computer.¡°Some time ago someone asked me if I can figure out how to control HP¡¯s laptop keyboard backlight,¡± wrote Myng. ¡°I asked for the keyboard driver SynTP.sys, opened it in IDA, and after some browsing noticed a few interesting strings.¡±The strings led to something that appeared to be a hidden keylogger ? a program that sends typed characters to an attacker ? in a Synaptics device driver. Given that the decompiled code prepared and sent key presses to an unnamed target, Myng was fairly certain he had something interesting on his hands.Luckily, HP responded quickly.¡°I tried to find HP laptop for rent and asked a few communities about that but got almost no replies,¡± he said. ¡°One guy even thought that I am a thief trying to rob someone.

99,gadgets,"Skiing has always been something of a nightmare for me. I first ¡°learned¡± how to ski in middle school, and still to this day don¡¯t really understand how to stop. I once went to a ¡°black diamond¡± mountain in Minnesota (read: gently sloping Midwest hill) and had to slam myself into the ground before skiing straight into the ski chalet.I¡¯m hardly alone in my fear of skiing. The ski and snowboard industry is suffering a generational downturn in the sport, driven by less snow due to climate change as well as an increasingly sedentary population of young athletes more addicted to their smartphones than to the slopes. While several top resorts are growing exceptionally well, many other locations are shrinking and at risk of disappearing.Cue Sno-Go. The product, the brainchild of Utah-based co-founders Chase Wagstaff and Obed Marrder, is a ¡°snow bike¡± with three skis and handlebars that allows any person to get back onto the mountains.Riding the bike is simple. Riders stand on the back two skis just as they normally would with traditional skis, but instead of holding ski poles, they grip the handlebars connected to the front ski. The whole bike articulates as you move your weight from one side of the bike to the other, allowing the rider to navigate hills with ease.For Wagstaff and Marrder, the product ? and the startup they are building ? is the culmination of a years-long pursuit of a better ski experience.The two first met in seventh grade, and both faced similar challenges with skiing. ¡°I come from a family of five boys, and all of my brothers are practically professional skiers, so from an early age I was forced to go to the mountains,¡± Wagstaff explained. Yet, he didn¡¯t like skiing, and couldn¡¯t get into snowboarding either. Marrder tried skiing, but on his first attempt broke his wrist, and on his first attempt to snowboard, broke a thumb.Instead, the two got into mountain biking, and biked every summer. That worked great when the mountains were clear, but was hard in winter when snow made biking impossible. ¡°Winter-time was just dreadful since we didn¡¯t participate in any winter sport,¡± Wagstaff said, and so he and Marrder would be left behind as his family and friends headed up to the ski resorts for a weekend of fun.After graduating high school, the two hatched a variety of businesses, together and separately, including businesses in auto detailing, mobile phone repair, and nutrition supplements. Despite hard work around each of their entrepreneurial ventures, the two walked away with a string of failures, and their goal of becoming millionaires impossibly distant. Then an epiphany came. ¡°Our businesses were all failing, and we hadn¡¯t had much success,¡± Wagstaff explained. ¡°We realized we weren¡¯t passionate about what we were doing, and we were just starting businesses.¡±The two ran into the snow bike concept online and were intrigued by the technology. They ordered a couple of models and for the first time, started to enjoy their time on the ski slopes.The two decided to try prototyping some snow bike concepts. Wagstaff noted that at the time, only one resort in all of Utah would allow ski bikes ? Brighton Ski Resort. So the two started inquiring what the resorts concerns were. Two main issues came up that blocked allowance: the challenge of getting a ski bike onto a chairlift, and the risk that the bike would cut deep treads into the snow, making the mountain unsafe for other skiers.Most ski bikes at the time used two skis, but the two founders realized that a three-ski model made far more sense. They could align the three skis in such a way that the treads they left behind were identical to a standard pair of skis. They now had a concept, but prototyping a bike was expensive. Engineering and production would cost tens of thousands of dollars to get a model out, and unlike in Silicon Valley, there wasn¡¯t an immediate rush of venture capital to launch the company, nor was their exit money from a pervious venture return.So Wagstaff and Marrder did what any bootstrapped entrepreneur knows dearly: they worked side gigs to fund their dreams. ¡°What we did was do door-to-door sales every summer, and then we just poured that money into development,¡± Wagstaff said. Over a period of five years, the pair built a series of seven prototypes, each one getting better and more focused on their vision of what a snow bike could be.In 2015, they were ready to go. The two scouted out a manufacturing partner in Utah with factories in China to produce the units. And then they launched a Kickstarter, which raised $42,710 from more than one hundred backers, with sales to more than 15 countries. ¡°We realized we were on to something, so we started talking with some local investors,¡± and the two built a syndicate of local Utah business leaders to fund the first round into the company.Fast-forward a season, and Sno-Go has launched an Indiegogo that has already raised almost $60,000. The base cost of their bike is $1,699, with a special rate for Indiegogo backers of $1,399. Part of that cost is the state-of-the-art Rockshox fork, which itself is hundreds of dollars per unit. Moving forward, the company intends to build a kids bike targeting a $700-800 price point so that whole families can come together skiing.For Wagstaff, seeing the vision for the product come to life has been rewarding, but the true value has come from customers who have suddenly gained the ability to ski for the first time. ¡°We get a ton [of customers] from the adaptive community,¡± Wagstaff said. He noted that several customers are veterans with injuries who can¡¯t use traditional skis, but can ride a snow bike because it gives them more stability while riding.Wagstaff noted that, ¡°When we started this business, it was just for us, we didn¡¯t have any intentions of impacting the lives that we are. So many people can benefit from us.¡± For two bootstrapped founders, toiling summer after summer has suddenly meant building a far more vibrant winter, and a path to becoming the ski business moguls they always dreamed about."
100,gadgets,"3D printers are useful devices for all kinds of reasons, but most have a critical weakness: they simply take a long time to actually make anything. That¡¯s because additive manufacturing generally works by putting down an object one microscopic layer at a time. But a new holographic printing technique makes it possible to create the entire thing at once ? in as little as a second or two.Light-based 3D printing techniques generally use lasers to cause a layer of resin to harden in a pattern, but like extrusion printers, they have to do it layer by layer. If the laser shined all the way through the liquid resin, it would cause a big line of it to cure.But what if you shined multiple weaker lasers through the resin, none of which was powerful enough to cure it except when they all intersected? That¡¯s the technique developed by a team led by researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.This basic idea has been applied in several other domains: by carefully overlapping weak beams of light, sound or radiation, you can expose a chosen volume to a critical amount while leaving other areas largely untouched.In this case, the three beams of light must be carefully patterned to only intersect with each other and produce that constructive interference in the exact points that need to solidify. And once that pattern is set, it only takes a handful of seconds to actually complete the process of curing the resin ? drain it away and your object is ready to use. A couple of other techniques have attempted something like this, but haven¡¯t been able to create complete 3D shapes like this.This figure from the paper shows the lensing and holographic setup as well as several examples of shapes printed using the technique.The advantages are plenty: you could, for instance, produce structures with other structures freely moving inside of them, like gears in a gearbox. There¡¯s no need for support structures underneath overhangs, so certain shapes that were impractical or impossible when printing from the bottom up or top down are straightforward to create this way. You also could quickly print multiple structures simultaneously ? a bunch of dice, for instance.It¡¯s still a bit crude compared with what comes out of most commercial 3D printers, but that¡¯s to be expected ? this is really just a proof of concept in a lab.¡°With this work we¡¯ve taken a solid first shot at this to demonstrate and prove out that ¡®3D all at once¡¯ fabrication is possible,¡± lead researcher?Maxim Shusteff told TechCrunch in an email. ¡°So we haven¡¯t yet pushed the limits of any of the build performance metrics (speed, build size, resolution, complexity).¡±Ultimately the ¡°resolution¡± will likely be determined by the smallest bit of resin that can reliably be solidified, which has to do with a number of chemical and optical factors. It would be premature to speculate on what that resolution might be, but from the results already obtained it seems clear that it will certainly work for the complexity levels for which 3D printers are already being used.Shusteff and his colleagues at LLNL, MIT, Berkeley and the University of Rochester aim to continue to develop this highly promising technique. Commercial applications are still a ways away, but it¡¯s not hard to imagine parties that would be interested in a 3D printer that creates things in a few seconds rather than, at the very least, several minutes, and more often, hours."

Now researchers University of California, Berkeley are working on a system that lets robots ¡°imagine the future of their actions¡± so that they can interact with things they¡¯ve never seen before.The technology is called visual foresight and it allows ¡°robots to predict what their cameras will see if they perform a particular sequence of movements.¡±Write the researchers:¡°In the same way that we can imagine how our actions will move the objects in our environment, this method can enable a robot to visualize how different behaviors will affect the world around it,¡± said Sergey Levine, assistant professor at Berkeley¡¯s Department of Electrical Engineeing and Computer Sciences. ¡°This can enable intelligent planning of highly flexible skills in complex real-world situations.¡±The system uses convolutional recurrent video prediction to ¡°predict how pixels in an image will move from one frame to the next based on the robot¡¯s actions.¡± This means that it can play out scenarios before it begins touching or moving objects.¡°In that past, robots have learned skills with a human supervisor helping and providing feedback. What makes this work exciting is that the robots can learn a range of visual object manipulation skills entirely on their own,¡± said Chelsea Finn, a doctoral student in Levine¡¯s lab and inventor of the original DNA model.The robot needs no special information about its surroundings or any special sensors. A camera is used to analyze the scene and then act accordingly, much as we can predict what will happen if we move objects on a table into each other.¡°Children can learn about their world by playing with toys, moving them around, grasping, and so forth. Our aim with this research is to enable a robot to do the same: to learn about how the world works through autonomous interaction,¡± Levine said. ¡°The capabilities of this robot are still limited, but its skills are learned entirely automatically, and allow it to predict complex physical interactions with objects that it has never seen before by building on previously observed patterns of interaction.¡±"

What¡¯s the biggest announcement, you ask? It¡¯s probably a tie between the sudden release of a new expansion for Zelda: Breath of the Wild and a teaser for the next project from From Software, the creators of Dark Souls and Bloodborne.Well, let¡¯s be honest ? a new Zelda expansion, available now, is pretty much the only thing that matters in the world. Everything else can wait.The Champions¡¯ Ballad appears to be a follow-up to the original story, with the four champions working to defeat ¡°the beast¡± once and for all. More importantly, there¡¯s new horse armor that lets you teleport your mount to your location instantly. New weapons and armor await, and it also looks like there are a number of new shrines and larger dungeons. Oh, and you get an ¡°ancient¡± motorcycle. I¡¯d be playing it now if I hadn¡¯t left my Zelda cartridge in the U.S. when I crossed the pond for Disrupt Berlin. What was I thinking?!Less immediate but perhaps ultimately more intriguing is From Software¡¯s minimal trailer for its new game, which has no name but does have a tagline: ¡°Shadows Die Twice.¡± Some speculate this is a reboot of Shadow Tower, one of From¡¯s earliest games, but others point out that not only is this a line from venerated ninja series Tenchu, but the music and writing suggest a Japanese theme. No one is quite sure what the gruesome hardware on display is, though my guess is it¡¯s a grapple made from a bone.Next on the hype train is Death Stranding, the next project from Hideo Kojima, of Metal Gear fame. In the longest and most substantive look at the game so far, which really isn¡¯t saying much, we see a space-suited-up Norman Reedus attempting in vain to hide from invisible and enigmatic pursuers that seem to be attracted to¡¦ suffering? Life? Anything but the baby in bottle that later turns up inside Reedus.We¡¯re really no wiser than we were before, but Kojima¡¯s eye for the uncanny and dramatic is clear. He may be rather off the rails, but often our most interesting artists are.Some other trailers of note: The developers of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, a creepy mystery, show off their latest project, Witchfire.But if you were expecting another somber, slow-moving affair, the developers would like to remind you that they were also behind the excellent Painkiller and underrated Bulletstorm. It looks like a high-energy shoot-em-up in a strange, arcane world.I¡¯m particularly interested in Campo Santo¡¯s In the Valley of the Gods, in which it appears you and a partner (likely computer controlled) infiltrate a tomb not to raid it, but to document it with an old-timey movie camera.Perhaps you¡¯re not as much of an antiquarian as I am, but this looks like it should be a very interesting little adventure.Some other things worth noting: Bayonetta 3 was teased as a Switch exclusive, along with remasters of 1 and 2. This should please hardcore action fans who might not be satisfied with the console¡¯s otherwise great selection of games.And the soul still burns: Soul Calibur 6 was announced, though honestly I¡¯m still happy to play the original on Dreamcast."

This will turn a handful of those pictures, where they had been embedded on the web over the past few years, into empty frames. If you want to see light field images now, you¡¯ll need to see them in the desktop app.In 2012, when I reviewed the original Lytro camera, I wrote:¡°The Lytro software is limited to browsing your photos and grouping them into ¡®stories,¡¯ and you can upload them directly to (and only to) Lytro, which will serve them for¡¦ eternity, you hope. Not much of a choice there.¡±As I half expected would be the case at the time, eternity turned out to be on the short side ? until it became inconvenient for the company to host it. Of course, it¡¯s unlikely there were many active users of the service now; Lytro left the consumer camera market two years ago when there proved to be little demand for its technically amazing but ultimately gimmicky cameras.Non-living pictureOne never should trust services that offer so little flexibility in how you access and serve your own data, but Lytro¡¯s tech was unique in that it essentially required a special plug-in to view properly. These plug-ins you would embed wherever you wanted to share a ¡°living picture,¡± a rather clumsy solution that contributed to the usability problems endemic to the whole Lytro proposition.The living picture format is done forever unless the company releases some way to self-host them, but it seems unlikely. Any remaining users will have to export to ordinary stills or movie files in the desktop app.I¡¯m happy to see Lytro evolving and applying its very cool tech to a new market, but the bumpy road it has traveled is littered with lessons for young hardware startups."

108,gadgets,"Solar power could transform small communities around the world, but remote villages can¡¯t always scrape together the thousands of dollars required to install the requisite cells. The Sun Exchange wants to change that by leveraging the hearts and wallets of hobby investors who cover the installation costs and then have their share of the revenue trickle in for years to come. There¡¯s even a cryptocurrency!The whole thing, as explained onstage at Disrupt Berlin today, works like this. First, the Sun Exchange and its partners (solar companies in various sun-drenched locations around the world) locate projects where a small installation ? think less than a megawatt ? could make a big impact, for instance rural clinics or villages with inconsistent power.The installation is planned and priced out, and this info is put online at a dedicated page. At that point people can purchase a number of the solar cells in the facility, from a few bucks¡¯ worth to a major investment.Once the costs are covered, the array is constructed and put online within 60 days, its power provided to the community for a usage fee like any utility and investors (and the company) get a part of that fee proportionate to their ownership of the array. And it really is ownership: ¡°You¡¯re now the proud owner of some solar cells soaking up glorious African sunshine,¡± the FAQ reads, and the Sun Exchange just handles the leasing and fee collection. (And insurance and paperwork, of course.)Ideally, it¡¯s a win-win situation. The local community gets reliable, cheap power, and you get a steady (if small) source of income essentially coming straight from the sun.Founder Abraham Cambridge started working on the business years ago, raising a little money on Indiegogo and building a prototype with it in early 2016. But it was only when he got a bit of angel money that summer (from BoostVC) that he began making it into a real business. A $1.6 million seed round announced last month ought to keep the lights on (though that shouldn¡¯t be a problem with all that solar power).¡°Our main goal is to make the deal look attractive enough to encourage customers to take money out of existing investments that are backing fossil fuels and be put into solar energy,¡± Cambridge told me. ¡°It¡¯s up to you to decide whether it¡¯s a worthwhile investment.¡±There¡¯s also the feel-good factor, which can¡¯t be dismissed. These are investments that might otherwise never have been made. As Cambridge pointed out to me, they¡¯re well below the megawatt scale that established power companies would prefer to deploy. And decentralizing ownership is not just a good idea, it¡¯s only possible right now through small deployments of renewables with manageable costs.The cryptocurrency side of things isn¡¯t a gimmick. It¡¯s a way to move small amounts of capital from (say) the U.S. to South Africa without fiddling about too much with exchanges and bank fees. You can do a traditional currency exchange in order to pay in rand or another local currency, but that means your returns will be in that currency as well, so you¡¯ll have to convert back if you want to get paid. Using bitcoin can certainly make simple purchases more complicated than they need to be, but for good-size international money transfers, it¡¯s a pretty nice instrument.And then there¡¯s SolarCoin: it¡¯s another cryptocurrency, one that is awarded to you as a solar power operator for every megawatt-hour of juice your cells generate. They¡¯re not particularly valuable (currently around 50 cents per coin) but hey, it adds up.Cambridge has been refining things and smoothing out obstacles since the idea struck him, but said that more than anything the interest shown by users has vindicated the model.¡°I spent the first year of the business mapping out obstacles and so the model we¡¯ve been running with is pretty resilient,¡± he told me when I asked how he had improved things compared with the early stages. ¡°What is stronger is people signing up and using the service, proving wrong the naysayers who said that no one would want to buy solar panels in this way and that bitcoin was a fad.¡±The skyrocketing price of bitcoin has also led to larger-than-expected transaction fees, meaning he¡¯s had to adjust the funding process a bit. But Cambridge is confident that will work itself out. In the meantime, the site and service are live, as are the initial successful installations. If you¡¯d like to bring a little light into someone¡¯s life and maybe make a buck off it, you can sign up at The Sun Exchange now."
109,gadgets,"Cars these days are basically computers with wheels, and as with other computers, you¡¯ll probably want to make a few changes to protect against cyberthreats. Trillium, presenting today on Disrupt Berlin¡¯s Startup Battlefield stage, is looking to be the security solution for in-car computer systems, adding extra encryption, intrusion detection and other firewall-like features.We¡¯ve already seen demonstrations of cars being hacked while on the road; the danger may be largely theoretical today, but it could make the jump to practical tomorrow.¡°Hacked cars pose a far greater danger than hacked desktop consumers,¡± Trillium¡¯s Adrian Sossna told me. ¡°The possible damage that a rogue hacked car can make is vast. It¡¯s already happening, and I am concerned that we will see large hacks in the next 12 months.¡±It behooves auto manufacturers to inoculate against it, considering how hard they¡¯re pushing connectivity as a marquee feature. Trillium aims to be a one-stop shop for that protection.Trillium¡¯s software lives on the car¡¯s computing hardware, doing a couple of main duties. First, it encrypts all in-car transmissions; this prevents a security soft spot like a backseat media screen or Wi-Fi hotspot from becoming a back door into more critical systems. And second, it watches over the car¡¯s networks for unusual activity that could indicate an intrusion attempt. The software updates itself.To be clear, this isn¡¯t something you¡¯ll plug in and install on your 2014 Accord. You can¡¯t actually fiddle with your car¡¯s internals to that extent ? it would be a serious safety hazard if anyone could tweak their car¡¯s engine control unit at will. Instead, it would be built into cars at the model level based on the needs of certain markets.¡°Trillium¡¯s solution is built to be embedded into the car when it rolls out of the factory,¡±?explained Sossna. ¡°Our future end-customer is a fleet owner that needs to protect its employees, cargo and society at large from car hacks.¡±So imagine you¡¯re a cab company and you¡¯re going to lease 20 new Priuses (Prii?) to add to your fleet. Looking at the models available, you see some have bigger wheels, some have leather trim, and so on ? and some will have Trillium built in. Considering a bad hack could do irreparable damage to your business, you¡¯ll probably want that last option. And eventually, Trillium¡¯s founders theorize, insurance could require this sort of thing, at which point it ceases being an option and becomes a standard safety feature.The pricing model is simple: $10 per car per month (not per day, as I had written here earlier), paid by fleet owners, not drivers or manufacturers ? think ambulance and limo companies, metro authorities, and so on. That way it¡¯s a continuing service that justifies itself with frequent updates.Of course, car manufacturers and in-car systems makers are already working on security measures, but Trillium plans to improve on those capabilities ? while also working as a turnkey solution that can easily be adapted to nearly any model. Currently the company is working on its final product with OEM, insurance, and Tier 1 supplier partners in Japan.Trillium claims to be hardware, OS, and cypher agnostic, so it can easily be adapted for a new model or deployed across multiple vehicle classes that might not share their network components. It works because their software acts more as a transport layer, not digging deep into the applications and data themselves but just moderating their communications.Cybersecurity in the automotive world is almost certain to become a major market, but it remains to be seen if there¡¯s room for an ambitious startup solution like Trillium¡¯s."

The company, which received funding through SOSVentures and Hax Accelerator, allows users to scan their bodies in motion, allowing for powerful analytics on golf swings, gymnastics, routines and everyday activities.The company is currently working with partners to create 3D recordings of various PGA instructions and pro golf players. One partner, 4DMotionSports, is creating 3D recordings of athletes for later playback.¡°Notch is the first company to bring true motion capture to smartphones and the only platform for motion capture-based apps that offers SDK for Android and iOS for building consumer-ready motion analysis products,¡± said Ozsvald. ¡°Compared to other products, Notch allows scalability from one to dozens of sensors and cost savings up to 10 times compared to products utilizing similar principles.¡±You can order a six-sensor Notch kit for $387 and they¡¯ve already sold 10,000 devices in the past few years.The company completed a successful Kickstarter and is now releasing their commercial product and app."
111,gadgets,"The traditional pregnancy test hasn¡¯t seen any innovation in over 30 years, with the exception of adding a digital component. Lia Diagnostics, launching today at TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin, wants to change that. The Lia pregnancy test will be the first-ever flushable test to hit the market, offering a more sustainable, disposable, convenient and private way for women to find out if they¡¯re pregnant or not.The company was founded in 2015 by?Bethany Edwards and?Anna Simpson, following research Edwards had worked on as part of her Master¡¯s at the University of Pennsylvania. She was interested in innovations in material science ? specifically, the idea of temporality and creating products that match up to their lifestyle, she says.A single-use pregnancy test, for example, is made with non-biodegradable materials, so it ends up in landfills if not recycled.¡°Single-use diagnostics are only used for a couple of minutes, and they¡¯re all made out of plastic and non-sustainable materials,¡± explains Edwards.She wanted to redesign how these products were made and manufactured so the product would biodegrade. The choice to launch with pregnancy tests came about because they hadn¡¯t been updated in decades.¡°It¡¯s been the same stick test since 1987, and that¡¯s kind of crazy,¡± Edwards says.The Lia test offers an alternative to traditional tests, but works in much the same way.Like other tests, it¡¯s a stick that reacts to urine to determine pregnancy, and it displays results as two lines if pregnant or one line if not, as before. There¡¯s a larger collection area on the test, which makes it easier to use, but the real change is around how the test is made.Unlike traditional tests, Lia¡¯s tests are made from a special paper that will disperse in water and biodegrade, allowing it to be flushed. That means women won¡¯t have to hide the tests in the trash, take tests in public restrooms, or any of the other things they do in order to have privacy around this often anxiety-producing event ? no matter what results they¡¯re hoping for.The tests will also appeal to those who want to buy a more natural product than one made of plastic.The company has patented the technology around the tests themselves, including both design and utility patents, with several others still pending.At TechCrunch Disrupt, Lia is announcing it has received FDA approval and is planning to start selling its tests online in mid-2018, initially via its own website and on Amazon. It will later evaluate its retail strategy.The test will cost somewhere in the middle of today¡¯s range for traditional tests ? that is, between $9 and $22 (the prices for a single generic test to an advanced digital one).Additionally, visitors to the Lia website can choose to donate a test for $10 to partner organizations the company is working with, including Planned Parenthood Global, SOS in Canada, and others.The plan is to make the test available worldwide.However, the company¡¯s technology has more applications beyond pregnancy tests in the long-term, Edwards notes.¡°What we¡¯ve done here is essentially creating a new category of water-dispersable, biodegradable diagnostics,¡± she says. ¡°This is just the start for us.¡±Based in Philadelphia, Lia is a team of seven full-time and growing. It¡¯s backed by seed funding from DreamIt Ventures, Ben Franklin Technology Partners, and other angel investors."
112,gadgets,"S¡°At that point I was probably like 30 watches in so I thought I knew what I was doing,¡± said Dakin, describing his early collecting experiences.Many first-time collectors like to create huge collections of watches, picking up cheaper pieces to get a feel for the market. This Movado was something special, however. It was made by a classic maker made famous by their ultra-minimalist Museum watch, a piece featuring a dot, a noon and nothing else. The watch arrived in the mail and it looked legitimate. He wore it for a while and then took it to a jeweler to see how much it would be worth if he cleaned it up and resold it.The jeweler took the watch to the back of the shop and came back upset.It was a fake. A very good fake.Ebay and other online markets have always trafficked in fakes. From fake memory cards to swap meet Louis it¡¯s hard for the average online consumer to tell if they are buying real products and often they don¡¯t care. But in the case of watches like Movado, Omega and Rolex, it¡¯s getting harder to tell the real from the replica and the stakes are surprisingly high.¡°I would have worn and eventually sold it thinking it was real had I never compared to a real one,¡± said Dakin. He was impressed.¡°Once you see a good fake it¡¯s actually scary to think about how many people are walking around with a fake watch that they think is real and they will sell or pass down to someone thinking it¡¯s real,¡± he said.Fake watches have always plagued the horological arts. But these fakes ? created so that they can sell for a maximum price to unsuspecting buyers ? are getting better and better. In fact, the Movado Dakin bought seven years ago was probably far from the best available fake on the market.Welcome to the strange world of SuperFakes, a new breed of fake watch that, thanks to advances in manufacturing and 3D printing, are often indistinguishable from the real thing. Fakers make these pieces for pennies and can sell them for thousands, often duping first-time collectors and experienced resellers with their high-quality creations.Fakes have been around as long as watches have graced the pockets and wrists of folks who would pay for them. In the 1800s, boulevardiers considered American watches made by Hampden and Elgin to be the best in the world. Made in bulk using new machining techniques, American watches beat Swiss and French pieces in quality and reliability. Swiss watchmakers found themselves at a loss. They depended on untrained laborers and older milling and cutting machinery, and they found their pieces were getting steadily worse.Swiss watchmakers had a plan, however. They would use American techniques to create exact copies of American watches.The most frequently duplicated pieces were popular ¡°railroad watches,¡± the saucer-sized pocket watches carried by old-timey train conductors. Rather than copy the pieces wholesale, the Swiss depended on marketing slight of hand to sell their wares: They changed popular brand names slightly to avoid detection and simply sold them alongside the superior American pieces. Illinois-made Elgin became the Swiss-made Elfin. Marion Watch Company became Marvin (which, in turn, investors revived as a luxury brand in the 21st century), and ¡°A.W.W.Co¡± became ¡°B.W.W.Co.¡±. These fakes, far from being the worst of the lot, were designed to copy the superior American wares in every way.This habit fell away as Switzerland caught up with and surpassed American manufacturers. Now, however, it¡¯s the Swiss suffering from the same fake fate that befell the American brands.The fakes industry ? created as a reaction to the changes in engineering techniques in the 18th and 19th centuries ? resurfaced in the 20th century when watchmakers began selling luxury watches made of steel and brands like Rolex gained prominence. Because it was far easier to fake a watch in plain metal than in a gold, Canal Street in New York became a veritable wholesale market for fake Presidents and Daytonas. Many of these reproductions were laughably bad with poorly placed logos, fake chronograph pushers, and even quartz movements in watches that were supposed to be completely mechanical and ¡°hand made.¡± But that didn¡¯t stop buyers from snapping up these ¡°faux-lexes¡± as status symbols.These obvious fakes have slowly given way to fakes that are so uniquely well-made that they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing.The Federation of the Swiss Watch industry says Switzerland produces 30 million watches a year. They estimate that fakers build 1.6 million a year, ensuring that your chances of finding a fake in the wild are fairly high. The new manufacturing technologies that make it easier for Chanel to make ceramic cases make it easy for fakers to produce something similar, if not identical, to the real thing. It is trivial to get these fakes from the factory to the street, leading to a flood of fake watches that are almost indistinguishable from real watches to the average consumer.Hamilton Powell sees the flood of SuperFakes almost every day. His company, Crown & Caliber, specializes in reselling pre-owned watches. Owners send in their watches for appraisal and receive a check. Crown & Caliber¡¯s in-house watchmakers clean and regulate the pieces and then sell them to collectors who want a deal on popular pieces like Rolex Submariners, Omega Speedmasters, and Panerai Submersibles. The company has processed 15,000 fine watches and has seen hundreds of fakes.¡°Historically, less than 5 percent of the watches that we authenticate are fake,¡± said Powell. ¡°At one point this number was as high as 10 percent.¡± However, the numbers are growing.Powell is pragmatic about the fakes market. It¡¯s inevitable.¡°E-commerce has been a blessing and a curse,¡± he said. ¡°The blessing? The world is at your fingertips, and we can now find and receive goods faster than ever before. With that, there are legitimate resale platforms out there, making it easy to find and access a wide selection of luxury timepieces. These sites have built their business on authentication and quality. However, there is a market of people who are selling fake goods passed off as real.¡°Technology advancements and access are the culprits. To start, access to high-tech machinery is more prevalent than ever,¡± he continued. ¡°So, what could have been a rare or cost-prohibitive piece of equipment is now available to more people.¡±?F¡°Panerai SuperFakes are some of the best out there given the minimalism on the dials,¡± said Powell.These watch brands are entry-level in the strange and pricey Pantheon of luxury watches. However, said Powell, less popular and more expensive makers like Chopard, Piaget and Hublot are seeing fakes hit the market, a testament to the broad popularity of once-exclusive watch models. While actually quite difficult, fakers spend extra time and money on creating realistic SuperFakes because the stakes are so high.Emma Monks, head of social media risk at Crisp, a brand-safety adviser, says that fakes worth ¡°nearly half a trillion dollars¡± hit the market yearly.¡°It¡¯s not just an issue of hitting the luxury brand¡¯s bottom line, though. The reputational damage and loss of consumer trust are massive problems,¡± she said. ¡°Counterfeits are often of inferior quality leading to, at best, an influx of customer complaints and, at worst, injury from dangerous fakes. If the buyer believed the product they bought to be genuine, even after they approach the brand and discover it¡¯s a fake, the lingering bad taste from the experience can sour their trust and appreciation of the brand.¡±In other words, fakers can make thousands of dollars on a good fake rather than a few dollars on an obvious fake. In fact there is an entire world of ¡±replica watches¡±?that sell many exact copies of popular watches. This strange underworld is similar to the replica car market where fans buy supercars for $20,000 because they are ¡°reskinned¡± Toyota Camrys and Corollas.These replicas live in the murky world of dedicated fandom if you can convince an eBay buyer that the Rolex they are buying is authentic a $300 replica turns into a $5,000 jackpot.¡°The high price-point of luxury is what appeals to these counterfeit craftsmen,¡± said Powell. ¡°They can make a lot of money without a lot of investment into each piece.¡±Thanks to a rise in the vintage market, fakers can also turn old watches into Rolexes and Omegas by replacing parts like faces, hands and movements. In fact, some fakers create real-looking parts on authentic equipment, a wild extravagance that is well worth the time and effort. Some fakers also create frankenwatches, pieces that use real parts to create a watch that is more valuable and collectable than the original piece.¡°When a brand hits a rough patch, they will sometimes sell off some of their equipment,¡± said Powell. ¡°This allows people to create inauthentic parts made on authentic machines.¡±How do fakers make these watches so realistic? They begin by choosing an easily reproducible design. Take these Panerai Luminors, for example. The real model, on the right, would be indistinguishable from the fake on the left to the untrained eye. The font and hand style look quite similar and only small clues ? the thickness of the hands, the quality of the illumination ? would give away the trick.?The trouble continues inside these pieces. In the photo above, the piece on the right is the fake. Compare it to the more austere but real movement on the left. The fake movement, a copy of the Unitas 6497, has been engraved with repeating logos and ¡°beautified¡± with a few unique additions to an otherwise generic movement.This exuberant modification is designed to through the unwary off the trail. After all, a storied watchmaker like Panerai wouldn¡¯t put such a boring movement into a $10,000 watch¡¦ or would it???T¡°SLS type of metal parts are too porous and have a matte finish,¡± said Jon Buford, a 3D printing expert in Hong Kong. ¡°For the most part, the precision isn¡¯t there for the feature size. You are probably more likely to be able to do a micro-CNC (subtractive) type of process to make things and have the same output as the traditional processes. Another possibility would be to do additive 3D printing process and then do precision subtractive processes to clean them up.¡±High end fakers aren¡¯t just effecting watchmakers, however. Fakers are taking the tricks they learned in manufacturing to other products. A few months ago Benjamin Saks of Kerfcase needed a copy of an iPhone X to test a new case model. They visited the web and found just the thing.¡°Since apple announced in September but the iPhone X didn¡¯t drop till November This gave us a lot of time to look at the drawings and photos of the phone, but I really wanted one in the shop to test,¡± he said. ¡°I had looked around on the typical places. Alibaba and AliExpress have shady dummy phones, in bulk, but it¡¯s always a crapshoot. I thought, hey, Amazon has everything. Literally. Maybe not for the best price, but it was worth a shot. So I did a simple search for ¡®dummy iPhone¡¯ and found this.¡±It was a near perfect replica of an iPhone made with extremely high-quality components.¡°It has a steel plate inside the injection-molded ABS frame. There is glass on the front and back (thin) and buttons with de-dents so they click. The port has nothing in it, and the speakers also are just holes. A close inspection would let you figure out it is a fake, but if left on the bar at your favorite watering hole, it would for sure get swiped,¡± he said.¡°It is incredible that a whole industry exists to make products like this. The quality of the molds is very high ? ejector pins are clean, seams are tight and the hand assembly that has to be done is amazing for something that likely costs a few bucks to manufacture.¡±This frustrates everyone in the manufacturing industry.¡°Detecting and combating counterfeiters is not easy,¡± said Monks. ¡°Many are operating out of countries where prosecution may be impossible, and that gives them the confidence to flaunt their products on image-driven social platforms such as Instagram. Taking action against their accounts is digital whack-a-mole; the counterfeiter generally has dozens more accounts already created and ready to activate in order to avoid disruption to their trade.¡±Ultimately these fakes end up hurting consumers and forces makers to dedicate precious resources to fake reduction rather than innovation. As wristwatches fall in popularity there is less to be made in the luxury watch market, making it all the more important for storied brands to fight back against fakes.Whether or not you see the value in buying a $12,000 watch that can be faked for $5, watchmaking is a rapidly diminishing art and watchmakers are slowly leaving the field, disheartened by consumers who are happy to tote around a $300 fake Rolex over a real piece with history, provenance, and quality. Still, sometimes fakes make it through to consumers who end up disappointed that their amazing watch isn¡¯t quite as amazing as they thought.¡°We offer all of our customers an ¡®out¡¯ ? we send them an empathetic email apologizing for having to be the bearer of bad news that the watch they sent us was a replica, we don¡¯t use the word fake,¡± said Powell. ¡°Most of these people never contact us back. The ones who do are generally really embarrassed and apologetic because they had no idea.¡±"
113,gadgets,"While some spacecraft get the chance to go out in a blaze of glory, others are in it for the long haul ? Voyager 1 more so than any other. The mission celebrated its 40th anniversary this year, but it¡¯s not just a lump of metal floating through interstellar space: that baby still runs. Thrusts, rather.Of course, many parts of the Voyager craft still work despite their age ? they¡¯ve been sending reliable telemetry back since launch, including the memorable data in 2012 indicating that Voyager 1 had entered interstellar space. But the crafts¡¯ power sources are estimated to run dry around 2025, at which point they will no longer be reachable.In anticipation of that moment, perhaps, a group of engineers at NASA¡¯s Jet Propulsion Laboratory have been kicking the tires on Voyager 1. They noticed that the craft¡¯s attitude control thrusters, which it uses to keep itself pointed the right direction, have been falling in efficiency for years.Fortunately, the Voyagers are equipped with backup thrusters included with this eventuality in mind. Only one problem: the last time they were used was 37 years ago, in 1980.To reawaken these dormant thrusters the team had to go back to the original Voyager documentation.¡°The Voyager flight team dug up decades-old data and examined the software that was coded in an outdated assembler language, to make sure we could safely test the thrusters,¡± said JPL¡¯s Chris Jones, who led the effort, in a JPL news release.That¡¯s because for all the team now knows, not being the original software engineers, there could be some bug or strange feature in the code that might interrupt normal operations or (heaven forbid). And the thrusters had never been tested for the 10-millisecond ¡°puffs¡± needed for reorientation.On November 28, the team sent the signal to warm up the thruster and fire off a few puffs. The radio waves traveled for 19 hours and 35 minutes before reaching Voyager 1 13 billion miles away; 19 hours and 35 minutes after that, they got the results of their little experiment.¡°The mood was one of relief, joy and incredulity after witnessing these well-rested thrusters pick up the baton as if no time had passed at all,¡± said Todd Barber.The test went so well that not only will Voyager 1 be switching over to the backup thrusters until there¡¯s no longer enough power to keep them warm, but they¡¯re looking into to doing the same thing for its twin, Voyager 2 ? after proper testing, of course."

The company still needs to flip a switch on its servers to enable it.Today¡¯s update also enables support for faster 7.5W Qi wireless charging. If you have an iPhone 8 or an iPhone X as well as a wireless charger that supports 7.5W or more, your phone will now charge more quickly as Apple first limited wireless charging to 5W.Some users have had some issues with the autocorrect feature. The default iOS keyboard would change ¡®it¡¯ into ¡®I.T¡¯ for no apparent reason. iOS 11.2 should fix that too.In iOS 11, if you tap on the Wi-Fi or Bluetooth icons in Control Center, iOS doesn¡¯t disable Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Instead, your phone disconnects itself from Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth accessories until the next day at 5 AM (or you restart your device, or you go to a new place for Wi-Fi).Apple doesn¡¯t disable those features so that you can connect your Apple Watch or Apple Pencil, enable Personal Hotspot from another device and use Wi-Fi for more accurate location features. With iOS 11.2, the icons are no longer greyed out. You¡¯ll now see white icons to indicate that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth still work, you¡¯re just not connected to any network or accessory.In smaller news, iOS 11.2 brings a couple of revamped emojis, new wallpapers, a new indicator at the top right of the lock screen to help you find Control Center and better Wi-Fi and Bluetooth indications.Releasing iOS 11.2 on a Friday night is a bit odd, but that might be because some iPhones keep rebooting themselves because of a time bug. After your device¡¯s clock passes 12:15 AM on December 2nd, 2017, apps with local notifications crash your phone (workout or meditation apps for instance). Apple may have rushed iOS 11.2 to fix this bug.

Great fire will come from the sky and burn the wicked and the good alike. A Furby will speak in the voice of Alexa. The Turtle of the Universe will cough up her young to pass judgement on our collective consciousness.At least one of those things has just come true. In this clever DIY project we learn how to add a Raspberry Pi Zero W to an old Furby and essentially train this little monster to tell us if our paper towel order shipped.The project uses an original 1998 Furby and essentially replaces the obfuscated CPU in the original model with a single-board computer, amplifier, and microphone. The Raspberry Pi is connected to Furby¡¯s facial expressions and there are plans to connect to Furby¡¯s IR sensor and emitter although that is beyond the scope of this project.The Furby runs Alexa Voice Services to offer complete Amazon Echo functionality. This means you can ask Furby the weather or even to turn off your compatible lights.The project took months to figure out but should only take you a few hours to complete with the right parts. The creator, Zach Levine, wrote that this project was particularly tricky.¡°This was probably my longest-running project ?

The new capability makes it possible for the device to accomplish two different missions at the same time. It was rolled out with little fanfare and first noted by CNET. We¡¯ve since confirmed the addition with Google. It¡¯s a bit surprising that the company rolled it out to Home units with no mention. It¡¯s a handy addition to what¡¯s essentially been a single-minded device. The company has been promising to add Routines since the Pixel 2 event a few months back, essentially creating pre-determined scenes that tie a bunch of actions to a command (something that¡¯s been supported by both Siri and Alexa for a while).?This is something else, though. Rather than having to preload all of that via an app, you can simply ask it to perform two jobs simultaneously. Only two, though. Not three or four ? that would be flying a little too close to the sun. You also have to separate tasks into individual commands, as the device won¡¯t understand two tasks crammed into the same sentence. Even though it¡¯s limited, the silently released feature is arguably more handy than the forthcoming Routines as it can be accomplished on the fly. In spite of letting Alexa get a pretty massive head start, Google¡¯s done a pretty solid job playing catch-up to the Echo¡¯s existing skill set. The new one comes as the company readies Home Max, a premium addition to the Home line due out sometime next month. "

Nest¡¯s lineup works with Google Assistant, but also with Amazon¡¯s Alexa; bringing it back into Google¡¯s core hardware team could help develop better integration with Assistant and the company¡¯s other mobile and networking devices, building a more extensive competitive hedge.Now that Google is developing out its Google hardware business in earnest, it also makes a bunch of sense to bring this together in terms of branding and making sure that consumers are clear about the relationships and advantages inherent in Google¡¯s growing device ecosystem.This is still just a move that¡¯s being considered, per this report, and not something final ? but it¡¯s hard to see what the big advantages are at this stage in terms of keeping Google and Nest distinct, especially with Google¡¯s focus on Pixel, its Wi-Fi products and Google Home along with its Assistant companion."

120,gadgets,"The Food and Drug Administration has just cleared AliveCor¡¯s Kardiaband EKG reader as the first medical device accessory for the Apple Watch.Europe has been able to use a version of the Kardiaband for Apple Watch for some time now but, thanks to the new FDA approval, the device can now be used in the U.S., marking the first time an Apple Watch accessory will be able to be used as a medical device in the States.Up until now, AliveCor has used the KardiaMobile device, which was stuck to the back of your smartphone and paired with an app to detect abnormal heart rhythm and atrial fibrillation (AFib). The new Apple Watch accessory, Kardiaband, clicks into a slot on the Watch band to do the same thing.However, rather than needing to hold your smartphone with both hands for 30 seconds to get a reading, you can get an EKG reading continuously and discreetly just by touching the band¡¯s integrated sensor.Along with the new Kardiaband for Apple Watch announcement, AliveCor is introducing a software feature called SmartRhythm, which uses a deep neural network to give you insight into your heart rate and can potentially detect an abnormal heart beat using the Kardiaband or KardiaMobile EKG reader.Note, there have been a couple studies conducted using just the Apple Watch¡¯s built-in heart rate monitor to detect an abnormal heart rhythm. This spring, UCSF and Cardiogram conducted one such study, concluding the Apple Watch could detect an abnormal heart rhythm with a 97 percent accuracy when paired with?an AI-based algorithm called DeepHeart.Later, the same eHealth study concluded the Watch could also detect sleep apnea and hypertension with similar accuracy using its built-in sensor.But, as AliveCor CEO Vic Gundotra points out, it¡¯s one thing to be able to detect and another thing to get FDA approval to use your sensor as a medical device.¡°Apple might be able to say ¡®oh your heart rate is high¡¯ ¡¦but what does that mean? Does that mean you should go to the hospital? And if you go to the hospital what are they going to do?. Any doctor will say ¡®ok come in, let¡¯s get an EKG reading¡¯,¡± Gundotra told TechCrunch.EKGs are usually only available in offices and hospitals ? and only after a life-threatening event. Having one on your wrist that you can use to check your heart and then send a readout straight to your doctor is vital to prevention of a heart attack or stroke.And, as Gundotra also points out, ¡°It¡¯s not possible to diagnose atrial fibrillation without FDA clearance. That is a big, big play.¡±It¡¯s worth noting Apple could easily replicate what AliveCor is doing. It has all the right equipment within the Apple Watch and? the manpower to do so. However, it doesn¡¯t seem likely Apple would want to go through the hassle of FDA approval for the Watch, which is a general purpose device used for numerous other applications besides getting your heart rate.The FDA has also told TechCrunch in the past that it would be the software, not the platform on which it operates, that would be regulated anyway.That¡¯s not to say someone else couldn¡¯t come up with an FDA-approved EKG reader but so far AliveCor seems to have the market on that for both the KardiaMobile and now the Kardiaband.That¡¯s an important marker for the company.?AFib is the most common heart arrhythmia, and a leading cause of stroke. In fact, one in four adults over the age of 40 could be at risk.¡°This is a medical device. This is not a toy that says your heart might be irregular. This is an FDA-cleared device. It¡¯s one of the hardest things I¡¯ve ever done in my life,¡± Gundotra said.Those interested can get their own Kardiaband starting today for $199 on AlivCor¡¯s site.

122,gadgets,"Apple hasn¡¯t shared any exact number, but Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang calculated that Apple may have sold as many as 6 million iPhone X units this weekend alone, StreetInsider reported.With such a big number, it¡¯s hard to grasp Apple¡¯s success with the iPhone X. Last quarter, Apple sold 39.3 million iPhones when you combine all iPhone models. In other words, Apple usually sells around 1.75 million iPhones during a 4-day period.So this weekend was a huge weekend for Apple, even if you don¡¯t take into account other iPhone models. The company sold more than 17 iPhone X units every single second during four days.Rosenblatt also says that Apple currently produces 3 million units per week. But this could increase to 4 million units per week in just a few weeks. Overall, Apple may have sold 15 million iPhone X units ever since it went on sale.Zhang says that most people buy the more expensive 256GB model. Apple is currently selling twice as many 256GB units of the iPhone X compared to the 64GB model.This should greatly improve Apple¡¯s average selling price in the company¡¯s next earnings report. Apple could end up selling 30 million iPhone X units during the current quarter that ends in December, and 40 million units during the next quarter. It turns out that a premium iPhone wasn¡¯t a bad idea."

QKD is the process of distributing keys during a transmission and in a way that will tell both sides of the conversation that someone is eavesdropping. The new system, which uses lasers to transmit multiple bits at once, can be used to connect and secure quantum computers in the future.¡°We are now likely to have a functioning quantum computer that might be able to start breaking the existing cryptographic codes in the near future,¡± said Daniel Gauthier, a professor of physics at The Ohio State University. ¡°We really need to be thinking hard now of different techniques that we could use for trying to secure the internet.¡±Their paper is available here.Most current QKD systems transmit data ¡°between tens to hundreds of kilobytes per second,¡± a rate not sufficient for most uses, including chat and telephony. The researchers can inject more information into each photon transmitted by adjusting the release time and the phase, thereby encoding two bits instead of just one. This means they can transmit keys quickly and securely and, more importantly, over fast fiber optic cables.The system uses off-the-shelf parts and, barring the detectors, nothing unavailable to normal telecommunications providers.¡°All of this equipment, apart from the single-photon detectors, exist in the telecommunications industry, and with some engineering we could probably fit the entire transmitter and receiver in a box as big as a computer CPU,¡± said Duke graduate student Nurul Taimur Islam."

125,gadgets,"Anything you can do, AI can do better. Eventually.On October 12, NASA put on its own demonstration, pitting an AI-piloted racing drone against world-renowned drone pilot Ken Loo.Researchers at NASA¡¯s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who have spent the last two years working on drone autonomy (which was funded by Google), built three custom drones equipped with cameras for vision and algorithms that would help them fly at high speeds while still avoiding obstacles.The drones, named Batman, Joker, and Nightwing, used algorithms that were integrated with Google¡¯s Tango technology, which helps AI map out 3D spaces.These drones could fly up to 80mph in a straight line, but on this particularly cramped course, were only able to hit 40mph.In a press release, NASA explained the pros and cons of both the autonomous drones and the human pilot. While the AI-powered drones were able to fly more consistently, they were also more cautious and, at times, ran into problems with motion blur at higher speeds. On the other hand, Loo was able to learn the course after a few laps and fly with much more agility than the autonomous drones, but is susceptible to fatigue.¡°This is definitely the densest track I¡¯ve ever flown,¡± Loo said in the release. ¡°One of my faults as a pilot is I get tired easily. When I get mentally fatigued, I start to get lost, even if I¡¯ve flown the course 10 times.¡±Long story short, the AI and the human started out with similar lap times, but Loo eventually won out and ended up with a faster average lap time than the AI.The implications here are big: autonomous drones may eventually be used for surveillance, emergency response, or inventory in warehouses."
126,gadgets,"The UK government has announced it will introduce draft legislation in the spring aimed at preventing unsafe or criminal use of drones.Last year it ran a public consultation that recommended addressing safety, security and privacy challenges around drone technology.Among the measures planned for the forthcoming Drone Bill plus secondary legislation amendments the government has planned are new powers for police to order an operator to ground a drone if it¡¯s deemed necessary.Police will also be able to seize drone parts to prove it has been used to commit a criminal offense, the government said yesterday.It had already announced its intention to set out a registration plan for drones?weighing 250 grams or more. Yesterday it reiterated that the incoming legislative changes will mean drone owners are required to register their devices.They will also have to sit safety awareness tests, as well as being required to use certain apps ? ¡°so they can access the information needed to make sure any planned flight can be made safely and legally¡±.In a statement, aviation minister Baroness Sugg said: ¡°Drones have great potential and we want to do everything possible to harness the benefits of this technology as it develops. But if we are to realize the full potential of this incredibly exciting technology, we have to take steps to stop illegal use of these devices and address safety and privacy concerns.¡±¡°Do not take this lightly ? if you use a drone to invade people¡¯s privacy or engage in disruptive behaviour, you could face serious criminal charges,¡± added assistant chief constable Serena Kennedy,?the National Police Chiefs¡¯ Council Lead for Criminal Misuse of Drones, in another supporting statement.While the UK currently has a Drone Code?intended to encourage drone operators to fly safely and responsibly, there have still been multiple reports of near misses between drones and aircraft ? and the government clearly feels the code needs to be backed up by new laws and powers.Yesterday it said it is considering whether to ban drones from flying near airports or above 400 feet ? noting these measures could form part of the new regulations.Safety research?it published this summer found that drones weighing 400 grams or more can damage the windscreens of helicopters.It added that it is also continuing to work ¡°closely¡± with drone manufacturers to use geofencing technology to prevent drones from entering restricted zones ? such as military sites.Another problematic use of drone tech that has emerged is for smuggling contraband over prison walls. Although it¡¯s not yet clear whether the government wants prisons to be included in the ¡®no fly zones¡¯ manufacturers bake into devices.¡°These new laws strike a balance, to allow the vast majority of drone users to continue flying safely and responsibly, while also paving the way for drone technology to revolutionise businesses and public services,¡± added Sugg.Also commenting in a statement, Tim Johnson, policy director at the Civil Aviation Authority, said: ¡°Drones can bring economic and workplace safety benefits but to achieve those we need everyone flying a drone now to do so safely. We welcome plans to increase drone operator training, safety awareness and the creation of no-fly zones.¡±At the same time as announcing incoming drone regulations draft, the government revealed it¡¯s funding a drone innovation project which launches today ? inviting UK cities to get involved in R&D focused on using the tech to transform critical services, such as emergency health services and organ transport, essential infrastructure assessment and repair, and parcel delivery and logistics.Up to five cities will be able to gain government support for carrying out some drone R&D as part of what it¡¯s dubbed The Flying High Challenge.The project is being run by Nesta in partnership with the?Innovate UK government agency."

The very experience of holding the phone and touching it is itself associated with that pleasure ? so much so that you might wish you were doing it even when you don¡¯t want to actually use the phone. That¡¯s when you need one of Klemens Schillinger¡¯s ¡°Substitute Phones.¡±The devices, if you can really call them that, are inert pieces of heavy, high-quality plastic in which are embedded stone beads that let you run your fingers along them to simulate various gestures.

128,gadgets,"Everyone loves drones, including companies with very specific needs. Drones once were the hot new thing and the perfect birthday gift. But drone makers are now realizing that there¡¯s a bigger opportunity with commercial use cases, from farming to inspection. That¡¯s why we¡¯re excited to announce that three founders of three amazing companies in the drone industry will?join us on stage at?TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin?on December 4-5, 2017.As we already announced, Henri Seydoux from Parrot is going to tell us about his company¡¯s shift. Parrot has been a pioneer in the drone industry. The company took advantage of the accelerometers, gyroscopes, wireless chips and energy-efficient processors that you can find in smartphones to power tiny quadcopters.But Parrot has also made multiple acquisitions for its commercial drone division. SenseFly, Airinov, MicaSense and Pix4D are now all owned by Parrot. The French company also owns multiple patents on drone technologies and sells integrated software and hardware solutions for firefighters, farmers and more.Second, James Harrison from Sky-Futures has been building software solutions for drone inspections. The company first focused on the oil and gas industry. When you think about it, it¡¯s so much easier to fly a drone around an offshore oil drilling platform to see if everything works fine.Other industries also have a hard time keeping an eye on inaccessible sites. If you¡¯re maintaining bridges, keeping an eye on wind turbines or overseeing construction sites, drones can be much cheaper than human inspection. Sky-Futures lets you record, log and share all your observations.Finally, Cl?ment Christomanos from Uavia has been working on remote aerial inspection. If you¡¯ve ever played with a drone, you know that they have limited battery life and that you need to stay in range.Uavia thinks this can be an issue if you need to inspect multiple sites around the country. You either need to train people on the ground or send drone pilots. With Uavia, you can control a drone thousands of miles away from your web browser.Drones receive instructions from traditional cell towers and then go back to charging stations when they¡¯re done. This can replace or supplement surveillance cameras in sensitive areas.All those use cases are just the tip of the iceberg. Goldman Sachs recently shared a report on commercial drones. There are more than a dozen industries that could greatly benefit from using drones.Get your Disrupt tickets right now to see the founders of Parrot, Sky-Futures and Uavia tell you everything about the future of drones. You¡¯ll also see the Startup Battlefield competition, in which a handful of startups pitch our judges with the hopes of winning the coveted Disrupt Cup and a cash prize.You¡¯ll get to chat with plenty of promising startups in Startup Alley, see amazing talks on the main stage, and unwind after a long day at the show with a cocktail and some new friends at the Disrupt after party.Do you run a startup?

130,gadgets,"French startup Snips is now helping you build a custom voice assistant for your device. Snips doesn¡¯t use Amazon¡¯s Alexa Voice Service or Google Assistant SDK ? the company is building its own voice assistant so that you can embed it on your devices. And the best part is that it doesn¡¯t send anything to the cloud as it works offline.If you want to understand how a voice assistant works, you can split it into multiple parts. First, it starts with a wakeword. Snips has a handful of wakewords by default, such as ¡°Hey Snips,¡± but you can also pay the company to create your own wakeword.For instance, if you¡¯re building a multimedia robot called Keecker, you can create a custom ¡°Hey Keecker¡± hot word. Snips then uses deep learning to accurately detect when someone is trying to talk to your voice assistant.The second part is automatic speech recognition. A voice assistant transcribes your voice into a text query. Popular home assistants usually send a small audio file with your voice and use servers to transcribe your query.Snips can transcribe your voice into text on the device itself. It works on anything that is more powerful than a Raspberry Pi. For now, Snips is limited to English and French. You¡¯ll have to use a third-party automatic speech recognition API for other languages.Then, Snips needs to understand your query. The company has developed natural language capabilities. But there are hundreds, or even thousands of different ways to ask a simple question about the weather for instance.That¡¯s why Snips is launching a data generation service today. I saw a demo yesterday, and the interface looks like Automator on macOS or Workflow on iOS. You define some variables, such as ¡°date¡± and ¡°location¡±, you define if they are mandatory for the query and you enter a few examples.But instead of manually entering hundreds of variations of the same query, you can pay $100 to $800 to let Snips do the work for you. The startup manually checks your request then posts it on Amazon Mechanical Turk and other crowdsourcing marketplaces. Finally, Snips cleans up your data set and sends it back to you.You can either download it and reuse it in another chatbot or voice assistant, or you can use it with Snips¡¯ own voice assistant. You can also make your capability public. Other Snips users can add this capability to their own assistant by browsing a repository of pre-trained capabilities.A Snips voice assistant typically requires hundreds of megabytes but is quite easy to update. After installing the Snips app on your device, you just need to replace a zip library file to add new capabilities.You also need to implement the actual actions. Snips only translates what someone is saying into a parsable query. For instance, Snips can understand that ¡°could you please turn on the bedroom light?¡± means ¡°light + bedroom + on.¡± A developer still needs to implement the action based on those three parameters.Developers are already playing with Snips to test its capabilities. But the company hopes that big device manufacturers are going to embed Snips into their future products. Eventually, you could think about a coffee maker with a Snips voice assistant.Compared to Amazon¡¯s or Google¡¯s wide-ranging assistants, Snips thinks that you don¡¯t need to embed a complete voice assistant into all your devices. You only want to tell your Roomba to start vacuuming ? no need to let you start a Spotify playlist from your vacuum cleaner.This approach presents a few advantages when it comes to privacy and network effects. Big tech companies are creating ecosystem of internet-of-things devices. People are buying lightbulbs, security cameras and door locks that work with the Amazon Echo for instance.But if you can talk to the devices themselves, you don¡¯t need to hook up your devices with a central home speaker ? the central hub disappears. If voice assistants are more than a fad, Snips is building some promising technology. And Snips could get some licensing revenue for each device that comes with its voice assistant."

The CosmicWatch is basically a little box that can detect high-energy cosmic rays as they hit the Earth¡¯s atmosphere and decay into muons.Muons hit the Earth in a ¡°light drizzle¡± say the device¡¯s creator, Spencer Axani. He and the other members of the team, Katarzyna Frankiewicz and Pawe©© Przew©©ocki of the National Centre for Nuclear Research in Warsaw as well as Janet Conrad at MIT, created an entire DIY system for building and measuring muons as they pass through the detector. You can find the DIY plans here and even download the project code on Github.

They plan on sending a detector up in a suborbital rocket.¡°At sea level, you might see one count every two seconds at sea level, but on a plane at cruising altitude, that rate increases by about a factor of 50 ? a dramatic change,¡± said Axani. ¡°From the measured rate you can back-calculate what the actual altitude of the plane was.¡±You can also use this device to map through walls, allowing you to make a map of another floor simply by seeing where the muons are more prevalent.¡°That¡¯s something I¡¯d like to try out at some point, maybe to map out the office on the floor above me,¡± said Axani."
133,gadgets,"French startup Blade, the company behind Shadow, announced at a press conference that it is launching new offers, updating specifications and the ability to become a client and buy a subscription without any waiting list.Shadow is a gaming PC in the cloud for a monthly fee. The company has been running thousands of computers with an Intel Xeon processor and an Nvidia GTX 1070 in a data center near Paris. You can then play demanding PC games on a crappy laptop, on a TV thanks to Shadow¡¯s own little device (pictured above), on an Android phone and more.Let¡¯s start with the new specifications. ¡°The next-generation Shadow is more powerful. When we started Shadow, we said obsolescence would be a thing of the past,¡± co-founder and CEO Emmanuel?Freund said. ¡°That¡¯s what we want to prove today.¡±Existing Shadow instances will be updated and have 8.2 teraflops of computing power compared to 6.5 teraflops with the previous configuration. The company says it is the equivalent of a $1,900 computer (¢æ1,600).When David Legrand from Next INpact asked about the new GPU, Freund didn¡¯t want to name the exact model. From what I¡¯ve heard, it¡¯ll be a mix of GeForce?GTX 1080 and Quadro P5000 at first. Nvidia doesn¡¯t recommend using consumer cards in servers because they¡¯re not meant to be running 24/7. At the same time, professional cards are more expensive.But it¡¯s clear that Nvidia wants Shadow to switch to server-grade GPUs in the near future ? Quadro P5000 and GeForce GTX 1080 should be more or less as powerful. When it comes to CPU, Shadow currently uses Intel Xeon 2620 processors.While there are already thousands of clients, Shadow has been very slowly rolling out its service. There¡¯s now a huge waiting list of people waiting for the next batch of instances. Starting on November 29, you¡¯ll be able to subscribe instantly.The company is opening two new data centers ? one in France for the company¡¯s home countries and neighbouring countries, and another data center in Santa Clara. Shadow has signed a partnership with Equinix, and 2CRSI is manufacturing custom servers for Shadow with four GPUs per server.A Shadow account will cost $53 per month, or $41 per month with a three-month commitment, or $35 if you¡¯re willing to pay for a year (¢æ44.95/¢æ34.95/¢æ29.95). Those prices aren¡¯t changing, but there are two major changes ? you get a beefier computer and you don¡¯t get Shadow¡¯s own device by default.Now, you can pay $140 or $9 per month (¢æ119.95/¢æ7.95) to receive Shadow¡¯s bridge computer. It is a good way to use your Shadow on your TV for instance. But if you only plan on using Shadow with your existing computer with Shadow¡¯s apps, you don¡¯t have to pay for this option anymore.In addition to that, Shadow is launching a second version of its app called Shadow Beyond. ¡°On an Android phone or a TV, you rarely use a keyboard and a mouse to browse Windows,¡± Freund said. So the company is launching a sort of media center interface to access your content. You¡¯ll be able to launch games, movies, photos, music and files.Freund reiterated that the company wants to attract 100,000 customers by the end of 2018. In order to do this, Shadow has added adaptive streaming?to its streaming clients. When you stream a video on YouTube, your browser automatically switches from 480p to 1080p if you have enough bandwidth, and sticks to 480p if you don¡¯t have a fast connection.Shadow is using a similar technique to downgrade image quality if you¡¯re using a DSL connection with only 15Mb/s. ¡°15 million homes [in France] can now use Shadow instead of 5 million homes,¡± Freund said.Back in June, the company raised a Series A round of $57.1 million (¢æ51 million). Many companies are working on computer instances in the cloud, such as Nvidia with GeForce Now and Amazon with WorkSpaces.Shadow is focusing on gamers first as they¡¯re demanding clients when it comes to latency and service quality. The company hopes that this narrow focus will help them improve the service and attract more clients in the future beyond gamers."

Gamevice is a bit like way to turn your iPhone or iPad into a Switch, at least in terms of adding physical controls to your gaming experience. But now the add-on can go beyond gaming, offering a way to easily control the DJI Spark with added precision and improved ergonomics when compared to just using a touchscreen device on its own.This is actually great news for Spark owners, since the diminutive drone has a lot going for it, including relative affordability, and decent picture quality. But the one thing it¡¯s lacking that the rest of the DJI lineup boasts is a solid physical controller experience included in the box ? the Gamevice provides that, with a design that¡¯s actually superior to the official DJI controller in a number of ways.You plug your phone or tablet into the Gamevice directly via Lightning connector, and the physical controls reside on either side. There¡¯s a full complement of buttons that allow you to control all aspects of the drone, including flight and photo and video capture.In addition to Spark support, the Gamevice now works with Sphero¡¯s SPRK+ programmable robot. If you¡¯ve ever used a Sphero spherical bot, you might already be aware that physical controls easily trump the onscreen touch sensitive variety.Gamevice starts at $59.99, and also still supports a range of games including Minecraft¡¯s mobile iteration. If you¡¯re a Spark fan, it¡¯s definitely worth a look, since it basically addresses one of the only weaknesses of the DJI drone without requiring a significant financial investment."

Toyota has a new, third-generation humanoid robot bears the charming name ¡°T-HR3¡± and is designed to be a helpful and safe assistant to humans. It also features a so-called ¡°master maneuvering systems,¡± which is essentially a VR-powered remote operating platform that a human can use to have the T-HR3 mirror its movements. Yes, kind of like a jaeger from kaiju movie Pacific Rim.The T-HR3 is designed to work in an assistant capacity to humans across a range of different potential uses, including in-home care, at hospitals, on construction sites, in areas impacted by disaster and even, Toyota says, in the far reaches of outer space. The robot resembles a somewhat short person with long arms and smooth white panels covering its mechanical bits, with optical sensors but into the head.An operator in the Master Maneuvering System has both arm and leg coverings that will convey their movements to the robot, allowing the operator to use a full range of motion to walk in place, manipulate arms and even grip with direct translation of their natural actions. The operator can also see from the robot¡¯s perspective, thanks to a head-mounted display (an HTC Vive, in the video) they wear.The synced up movement also has safeguards in place to ensure that the robot¡¯s movements don¡¯t interfere with the operator, so that you can¡¯t accidentally (or intentionally, I guess) club yourself with the bot while sitting in the chair.Remotely operated, dexterous humanoid robots have a lot of potential across basically all of human activity.

138,gadgets,"The Kindle has become one of the most ubiquitous pieces of specialty electronics in the world since it launched 10 years ago today, but the device has changed so much since its debut that one can hardly believe the oldest and newest models are meant to do the same thing.Amazon¡¯s Chris Green, VP of Design at its Lab126 hardware arm, talked with me for a retrospective of the design choices that have defined and redefined the device, and the reasoning behind them. Green has been at Lab126 for a long time, but not quite for the entire Kindle project, as he explained to me.For the next decade he¡¯d work on getting the Kindle closer to what he called the ¡°gold standard¡±: paper.¡°We can never be better than paper, but we can be as compelling,¡± he said. ¡°We really didn¡¯t want any bezel or bling or even page-turn buttons ? everything we¡¯ve done over 15 generations has been to reduce it to basically a piece of paper.¡± (With the new Oasis there have actually been a total of 16 ¡°generations¡± or models.)That may come as a surprise to those who remember the first Kindle, which with its chunky angles, slab-like buttons and aggressively ergonomic keyboard, seems almost brutalist. I¡¯ve always thought it would look at home on the set of Alien.Although he didn¡¯t help create the first generation, Green is plenty familiar with its design language. Turns out there¡¯s a very simple reason behind the angles.¡°If you have one of those around, you¡¯ll notice that the cross section is actually that of a paperback book ? the pages go at that angle,¡± Green said. ¡°The dimensions are even a standard paperback¡¯s. They were trying their hardest even at that early stage to represent a paperback book.¡±That consideration more or less went out the window with the second-generation Kindle, which did away with the sloping pages visual metaphor and walked back many of the other bold but unusual choices.¡°All the pitch points of the original Kindle ? the little Chiclets, and the fact that the keyboard was split ? those were very logical. It¡¯s very ergonomic,¡± said Green. ¡°So everything is very logical ? but when you take a deep breath, and take your head out of the bucket, you¡¯re like, wait, there¡¯s an easier way to do this. There¡¯s no reason for those keys to actually be shaped like that.¡±The redesign was aimed at making it approachable and attractive to a wider demographic ? one that might not appreciate the severity of the original. In my opinion, it worked: the clean lines and carefully designed proportions made the Kindle 2 a real looker, and years later it still holds its own.After this, Amazon introduced the short-lived Kindle DX, a large-format e-reader that didn¡¯t catch on, partly because the market for larger-format reading (articles, journals) wasn¡¯t as large or ready to spend money than the paperback-buying contingent.One particularly high-end feature got nixed before the DX even hit the market:¡°In the first version of the Kindle DX, the back had a fully quilted surface ? originally it was actually fabric, but that was too expensive,¡± Green said. But more importantly, he said, ¡°the highs and lows get wear and tear. We don¡¯t want people to be on the treadmill of upgrading, so we put a lot of effort into durability.¡±Green also mentioned the attention paid to features that are less easy to define ? basically, all the tiny things that make a device better or worse to read on.¡°Over the first few generations we spent a lot of time with customers ? we went everywhere with them,¡± he said. ¡°We had a really cool reading lab in our building where we would watch people read and see how quickly people¡¯s eyes got bored as they scan a line of text.¡± (¡°When people read,¡± he added, ¡°they fidget like crazy. It¡¯s uncomfortable to watch.¡±They determined the best spacing, kerning, line length and so on, making sure that the device improved in readability even as they changed other aspects of it.The third generation made a few small changes and one big one. The physical interface continued to shrink relative to the screen, moving slowly toward that gold standard. But more importantly, the device¡¯s main color went from off-white to off-black (¡°graphite¡±).Was this a response to black smartphones? Fingerprint complains? Material shortages? Nope: as some have suggested, it¡¯s meant to trick the eye.See, e-paper isn¡¯t really white, it¡¯s really a shade of grey, and not even a particularly light one. So when you give it a white bezel, the white plastic shows it up and makes it look even more grey. But with a black bezel, it works in the opposite direction: it makes the grey look lighter, and as a consequence, the ¡°black¡± letters, actually just a darker grey, look even darker.¡°That¡¯s exactly the reason,¡± Green said. ¡°We moved over the graphite to help with the contrast ratio. We wanted the black text to pop more on the display.¡±Combined with a new Pearl display from E Ink, it made for a major jump in contrast. And they¡¯d need that before moving on to the next generation.The fourth-generation Kindle was the first to do away with the keyboard, producing a notably smaller device. It seems to me to have lost something of its soul with this change, though; the Kindle 4 and its successors reminded me more of budget tablets of years past rather than a brand new device.It was the Kindle Touch, however, that signaled the future of the device ? although at the time, I wasn¡¯t very impressed with it or its competitors.¡°We always wanted touch,¡± explained Green; the keyboard and other buttons on early models were largely necessitated by the low refresh rate of e-paper displays. ¡°The thing is, those touch displays aren¡¯t optically clear. When there wasn¡¯t a frontlight, and you put this yellowing, sepia layer on it, it really made the contrast ratio worse.¡±The solution, a network of infrared blasters and sensors that could only tell roughly where you put your finger, was a stopgap measure.¡°If you have to take your thumb off the bezel, and put it over the display and put it down, that¡¯s cognitive load right there,¡± Green said. We used that IR window until we got the frontlight working, because that would burn away that sepia layer.¡±The frontlight was already well under way, and would be announced in the form of the Kindle Paperwhite. I saw a prototype several months before that, and it turns out Amazon had quietly acquired a company in 2010 called Oy Modilis that specialized in light-guiding films like those used in the Paperwhite.At the time, having taken care of even lighting, the designers were mostly worried about color temperature. The warmth of a tungsten bulb or flame illuminating a creamy page and ink-black (naturally) text is very difficult to replicate, and at the time they had to settle for something quite a bit colder, color-wise.¡°White LEDs are binned into 3 different temperatures: warm, blue, and neutral,¡± Green explained. ¡°And by mixing those bins you can get a nice blend. So we¡¯ve played with those blends to get where we are now ? but there¡¯s always room for improvement.¡±Although a frontlight makes for a vastly more convenient reading device, the color cast isn¡¯t for everyone. But Kindle has never gone the way Kobo did, adding a user-selectable color temperature setting. The team opted to keep things simple, Green said.In 2014 the Kindle line split again, adding the Voyage to the mix. In service of streamlining the device further it was decided to add an invisible alternative to tapping the screen to advance the page. PagePress used sensors inside the body of the device to tell when a user gave the edge a little squeeze, allowing them to advance the page even more intuitively. To Green¡¯s surprise, the feature wasn¡¯t particularly popular.¡°The page-turn buttons on the Voyage were expensive and very cool, but there¡¯s something about the button snap that¡¯s very satisfying,¡± he said. ¡°I was so surprised that people didn¡¯t like the PagePress tech, because it was silent, and a dome switch is noisy. People complained that the noise kept people up.¡± A lot of research had gone into it, but ultimately PagePress didn¡¯t become a staple of Kindle design.Some six months later, the third-generation Paperwhite appeared; its chief improvement was a new high-resolution display, but what can¡¯t be ignored is what that improvement allowed typographically. Amazon commissioned a completely new font built from the ground up for the Kindle¡¯s display and type engine: Bookerly.Bookerly wasn¡¯t a huge advance in typography or anything, but it¡¯s an important philosophical shift ? acknowledging the strengths and limitations of the type environment and designing for them, rather than attempting to ape paper. An e-paper display needs its own font and styling just as a newspaper does, or a textbook, or a logotype. Custom e-reader fonts had appeared elsewhere, so it was well past time Amazon did its own or risk looking lax in its dedication to the platform.The Oasis represented the largest change to the design of the Kindle perhaps since the loss of the keyboard. It also signaled further commitment to the e-reader as its own entity that only needs to replicate the printed page in some ways. Green said that the departure from the old style was a refreshing one for him.¡°There are certain things in the world that humans consider beautiful: the Golden Ratio, Fibonacci sequences, and of course symmetry,¡± he said. ¡°We got in a tight spot with the symmetrical design in that we couldn¡¯t take it any further ? so we took a bold shot with the Oasis.¡±¡°When you see people using these devices,¡± he explained, ¡°it becomes very clear that they want the center of gravity in their hand and the button under their thumb. But having physical buttons on both sides would be prohibitive [in terms of space]. An e-ink device today is basically a stack of display components and a stack of battery components, and those technologies are progressing at very different rates.¡±So they isolated the battery on one side, making it asymmetric (at least, in its normal orientation) but also solving the center of gravity, handedness and page-turn problems.The new Oasis is actually a major departure from its predecessor in that its screen has expanded to fill more of the device: it¡¯s the first Kindle with a 7-inch display, yet it¡¯s no larger than before. That takes us closer to the ¡°gold standard.¡±It also brings us up to the present, though the design is sure to evolve in the future.I asked Green if among the many, many Kindles there was one he¡¯d call his baby, a sentimental favorite.¡°My answer¡¯s a cop-out,¡± he said, truthfully, ¡°but it¡¯s the one you¡¯ve not seen yet.¡±He was extremely optimistic as to the future of e-readers in general. It¡¯s a great example of how a device with a single purpose is often the right tool for the job.¡°It¡¯s the difference between a hammer and a Swiss Army Knife, isn¡¯t it? If you want to go on a vacation or commute, you want a hammer ? you want a real e-reader, so you don¡¯t fall down a rabbit hole of your phone.¡±And the Kindle business, he pointed out, is booming: ¡°The last Prime Day was the best sales day ever in the U.S. ? and the market is just growing. It¡¯s taking off,¡± he said.¡°We¡¯re going to be here for a long time.¡±"

140,gadgets,"Swiss watchmakers have long resisted the siren call of ecommerce. While many of their products sold online ? you can find everything from Swatch to Breguet on the ¡°grey market¡± ? there were no official online channels for many brands. Until now.Omega, a Swiss watchmaker whose wares now grace the wrist of James Bond, just started selling online, joining Panerai and others in a move that signals a major change in the way expensive watches are bought.Historically, watch companies sold through authorized dealers. These were medium to large jewelry shops that had to show a certain level of traffic and earning potential. These ADs had to take whatever was given ? boxes of unwanted straps, older watches, etc. ? in order to get the latest models. Smaller shops could even lose privileges if they didn¡¯t sell enough, reducing their draw among the watch cognoscenti. Further, these dealers also took advantage of keystone pricing ? essentially doubling the wholesale price ? a deal that gave jewelry salespeople and the shop quite a chunk of profit.The AD network is clearly fading. Whereas once watchmakers advertised the number of ¡°doors¡± they sold out of the move to ecommerce shows that keystone is no longer in fashion and selling out of a jewelry shop, even one with a dedicated watchmaker on staff, is unappealing to the new consumer. While watch lovers have been buying and selling online for a decade, watch newbies almost always used to go into the shop to get a more hands-on introduction to the hobby. This is no longer the case.Further, ecommerce means that Omega gets to keep most of its profit. You¡¯re not going to get a special deal if you buy online and Swiss watchmakers rarely discount so, while it may be in your interest to pick up an Omega at a duty free, if you¡¯re in a hurry you¡¯re best served just checking out online. After all, when you¡¯re planning on spending $12,000 on a arguably beautiful Speedmaster you don¡¯t want to have to haggle with a jeweler in an ill-fitting suit.Things are changing rapidly in the Swiss watch game and this move by Omega is just one more step towards a new ? and potentially disruptive ? future for an industry that survived two World Wars and the onslaught of quartz technology. Whether or not it weathers this storm is anyones guess, but now it may have a fighting chance."
141,gadgets,"Amazon¡¯s newest Kindle Oasis arrived like the answer to a timely question ?? mostly because I happened to request an update to the device right before it actually arrived. I¡¯m an unabashed fan of the Kindle, dating back to its earliest days, so take that into consideration, but believe me when I say: The new Kindle Oasis is the Kindle update I¡¯d hoped for, and more.The new Oasis looks like the original version, but larger ? but looks don¡¯t tell the whole story. The new Oasis keeps all its battery in-house, meaning that you don¡¯t need a cover with it to get the full battery life out of the Kindle, as you did with the old one. It also has a 7-inch display, which is the largest to date on a Kindle barring the absurdly large (but still impressive in its own right) Kindle DX. It also has an IPX-8 water resistance rating, which means you can easily use it while on vacation without having any fear of damaging the thing.In short, it ticks all the boxes for what an e-reader should do; Amazon has taken a long time getting here, but this is finally the Kindle that leaves little to no room for ¡°I just wish it also¡¦¡± style statements. Amazon even added Bluetooth support for connecting a headset so you can listen to audiobooks, which now integrate much more seamlessly with their printed counterparts for switching between the two.Possibly the best part of the Kindle Oasis is how quickly it becomes essentially invisible; it¡¯s so ergonomic, with easily readable text and a glare-free screen with ambient lighting detection and a high enough resolution that you¡¯ll quickly forget you¡¯re using a gadget at all. An ideal e-reader is a conduit to the imaginative worlds created by books, and I¡¯d argue that nothing accomplishes this better than the new Oasis, which is at once immersive thanks to its large screen, while also being light and small enough to make it easier to handle than your average paperback.Battery life is a big step up from the original Oasis, and the added waterproofing takes away that one remaining worry you have if you¡¯re the kind to stress about device durability while trying to otherwise rally (at the beach, for instance). And the version with a built-in data connection and 32GB of storage satisfies the needs of anyone who reads a lot of comics or wants to travel without worrying about when they¡¯ll get a chance to download their next book.Amazon also sells covers for the Kindle Oasis, which connect like the one on the original version, adding relatively little in the way of bulk and protecting the display. These also double as stands for propping it up to read while you¡¯re doing something else, like eating in the cramped quarters of an airplane seat. But the Kindle works just as great with or without the cover, in my experience, so it¡¯s truly up to personal preference.In the end, when I asked Amazon for an updated Kindle this year, the new Oasis is basically exactly what I had in mind. It¡¯s still a bit pricey, but it¡¯s well worth it for any readers who love the experience, and want to make it better."
142,gadgets,"Independent watchmaker Defakto creates some stunning timepieces via its regular collection, but it has a new limited series that is particularly eye-catching. The new Defakto Stille Nacht is a collaboration with artist Friederike Bellman, and it uses a hand-painted star field to brighten and distinguish each watchface for the 50-piece limited edition run.The Stille Nacht (¡®Silent Night,¡¯ in English) arrives just in time for the holidays, appropriately, and it offers no traditional time indices, but instead shows a dense surface of points that also feature lime so that they glow in the dark. The hands (or hand, if you prefer the single-hand configuration also available) aren¡¯t coated with lume, so the star field will stand out on its own when in dim lightning conditions.As mentioned, that star scape is hand painted, airbrushed to make each of the 50-piece series totally unique. The watch features a 40mm face, a matte finish night-blue backdrop for the dial, a sapphire crystal and a Swiss-made Ronda 712 Quartz movement. It retails for around $320 US after conversion from EUR, without import duties.The watch can also be custom-built for either right- or left-handed individuals, and features a thin, 6.6mm case. It¡¯s a visually stunning piece and a good deal for a one-of-a-kind watch, so definitely take a look if you¡¯re a watch fan, or know one and are looking for a unique holiday gift to leave in their stocking."
143,gadgets,"A German regulator has banned domestic sales of children¡¯s smartwatches that have a listening function ? warning that parents have been using the devices to secretly eavesdrop on teachers at their kids¡¯ school.In an announcement on Friday, the Federal Network Agency telecoms watchdog said it had already taken action against some online sellers.?The target group for the smartwatches are children between the ages of 5 and 12 years.¡°Via an app, parents can use such children¡¯s watches to listen unnoticed to the child¡¯s environment and they are to be regarded as an unauthorized transmitting system,¡± said Jochen Homann, president of the Federal Network Agency in a statement. ¡°According to our research, parents¡¯ watches are also used to listen to teachers in the classroom.¡±Back in February, the same federal agency banned sales of an Internet connected doll ? called My Friend Cayla ? in the country where it¡¯s illegal to manufacture, sell or possess surveillance devices disguised as another object.On Friday the agency warned there are a large number of providers in the German market that are offering smartwatches for children which contain a listening function, often referred to as a ¡°baby monitor¡± or ¡°monitor function¡± in the companion app.The app owner is able to silently call the device via such functions and listen unnoticed to the conversations of the watch wearer and others in their vicinity ? an act of covert surveillance that is illegal in Germany.The agency has instructed parents to destroy any devices they have bought, and asked schools to be on the look out for smartwatches being used by children ? and to request destruction of listening devices they identify.The?Federal Network Agency is not the only European body concerned about risks posed by children¡¯s connected toys, nor specifically by kids smartwatches. Last month the Norwegian Consumer Council put out a report about children¡¯s smartwatches, raising concerns about security flaws, privacy concerns,?and risks posed by what they described as unreliable features.While this month a UK consumer rights group also raised concerns about poorly secured IoT toys which it said could enable strangers to talk to children. The group also called for devices with known security flaws to be banned from sale.The latest ban may increase pressure for the European Commission to consider whether European Union-wide regulation is needed for Internet connected toys. Back in February, the commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, expressed concern, telling the?BBC: ¡°I¡¯m worried about the impact of connected dolls on children¡¯s privacy and safety.¡±"

150,gadgets,"Microsoft¡¯s Surface Book 2 is the most powerful mobile Surface device yet. It easily blows away the Surface Pro, Surface Laptop and, of course, the old Surface Book. It¡¯s also one of the odder devices in the lineup, though. It¡¯s not just a Surface Pro with a rigid keyboard. It¡¯s a relatively heavy base with a powerful processor and graphics card and a big battery ? and it has a surprisingly light removable screen that turns it into a tablet and that features a less powerful processor and graphics chip.Microsoft shipped me a top-of-the-line 15-inch Surface Book 2 review unit with the latest Intel Core i7-8650U CPU clocked at 1.9 GHz, a discrete Nvidia 1060 GPU with 6GB of RAM, 16GB of memory and a terabyte SSD. That¡¯s $3,299 worth of Surface Book, though at the low-end, you can also get a 13-inch machine for $1,499 with an i5 processor, 8GB of RAM and an integrated Intel GPU. In between, there are a number of other 15-inch models with Nvidia 1050 GPUs and varying numbers for RAM and disk space.There surely a world of difference between the performance of these low-end and high-end machines, so you get what you pay for. But Microsoft¡¯s message here is pretty clear: the Surface Book 2 is basically a mobile workstation for those who want to edit videos and photos, play games on the road or just need a really powerful mobile machine to crunch numbers or compile a Linux kernel or two. It¡¯s Microsoft¡¯s challenger to the MacBook Pro and it¡¯s not shying away from the comparison.I¡¯ve only had the Surface Book 2 on my desk for just over 24 hours, so this isn¡¯t a definitive review (I have barely been able to run the battery down once in that time, after all). We¡¯ll do that in a week or so, after I¡¯ve had some more real-world experience with it.Even after a short time with the new Surface Book, I¡¯ve come away impressed (anything else at this price would be quite a disappointment, of course).We can argue about its design ? that rounded hinge that leaves quite a gap even when the laptop is closed wasn¡¯t everyone¡¯s cup of tea when the first version launched and while Microsoft has tweaked the hinge, the gap is still as prominent as ever. You may even call it ugly. But it sure makes it stand out in this crowded laptop market.What you can¡¯t argue about, though, is the overall quality of the build. The base is a solid piece of metal. The tablet/screen is securely attached to it (and the keyboard has a key that releases it from its base). The large chiclet keyboard has enough travel and gives you a good indication that you¡¯ve pressed a button, making it quite comfortable to type on.The touch-sensitive screen is bright and at a resolution of 3240¡¿2160, you¡¯re getting a higher pixel density than on the MacBook Pro. Thankfully, Microsoft and the software developers in its ecosystem have fixed most of Windows 10¡¯s issues with high-density displays, so you can actually now enjoy the experience. The screen may just be a bit too glossy for some (too many laptop screens these days are), but it¡¯s winter in Oregon and we won¡¯t see the sun until next year, so I haven¡¯t been able to test that.Let¡¯s talk about the key feature of the Surface Book 2 for a moment: the detachable screen. It¡¯s surprisingly light, especially when you consider that it¡¯s a 15-inch tablet with a promised five-hour battery life. But is it more than just a novelty? Microsoft argues that you can detach it and use it as a tablet, fold it around to go into ¡°studio mode¡± for comfortable sketching, or detach the screen, turn it around, re-attach it for mobile presentation.Some of these feel like niche use cases and I can¡¯t quite see myself doing any of this on a regular basis but that¡¯s probably a personal thing. I¡¯d be quite happy with the Surface Book 2 if the screen didn¡¯t detach, too (though at a lower price).The power of the dedicated GPU should make for a pretty good gaming experience (though not at full resolution and the highest settings ? it¡¯s not a 1080, after all. We¡¯ll run some benchmarks in the next few days.Oh ? and if you¡¯re worried about having to use dongles for this laptop, don¡¯t worry. It comes with a USB-C port, two regular USB-A ports, an SD-card slot and the usual Surface connector for charging and attaching the Surface Dock if you have one. And there¡¯s a headphone jack, too. There¡¯s no Mini DisplayPort like in the first-gen model, but you can connect up to two 4K monitors at 30Hz or a single 4k monitor at 60Hz via the USB-C port ? or via a Surface Dock, of course. You can¡¯t drive four screen by using both the USB-C and Surface Dock simultaneously, though.What about the negatives? The fan, especially in the screen, tends to kick in a bit too often. It¡¯s quiet but noticeable, even when the CPU load isn¡¯t all that high. The screen can also get a bit warmer than I¡¯d like. It¡¯s also heavy. At 4.2 lbs, you¡¯re not going to have to double-check that it¡¯s in your backpack. And there¡¯s the design with its odd hinge ? but I already mentioned that.Unlike the first-gen Surface Book, this one doesn¡¯t seem to suffer from the regular blue screens of death and other issues that buyers of its predecessor had to deal with. I hope that remains true as I continue to use it.Microsoft is clearly making a play for disgruntled MacBook users by throwing in a three-month subscription to Adobe¡¯s Creative Cloud Photography plan for the next two months, talking up how well Autodesk Maya and other apps work on the Surface Book 2, and ? most importantly ? by simply making this a high performance machine.So will the Surface Book 2 get MacBook Pro users to switch? That probably depends on how much you love/hate Windows 10, but it strikes me as a good ? and far more powerful ? alternative to Apple¡¯s current mobile offerings. And it¡¯s copious amount of power that sets it apart from the masses (plus its detachable screen, but I just don¡¯t know how big a selling point that¡¯ll be for potential users).The new Surface Books are available for pre-order now and will start shipping tomorrow."

For now Pip remains a prototype ? and the Glasgow, UK based startup still needs to reach its ?30k funding goal on Kickstarter, though it¡¯s already around half way there after a few days running the campaign.Early bird pre-order pricing for the Pip device is ?150, with the intended future RRP being ?200.It¡¯s true that kids today are already pretty spoiled for choice when it comes to learn to code and/or hardware hack gizmos parents can buy them. So we asked Pip¡¯s founders what makes their approach different?They described ¡°pocket-sized portability¡± as Pip¡¯s ¡°main USP¡± ? combined with its ¡°integrated touchscreen and friction-free, open-ended programmability¡±.¡°Pip is compatible with cheap electronics components that can be bought anywhere, as well as the thriving Raspberry Pi HAT ecosystem,¡± said co-founders Sukhvir Dhillon and?Jason Frame.¡°Pip makes use of standard languages and tools. Yes, it supports block-based programming for beginners, but once they¡¯re ready to move on we will support for a number of popular languages¡¦ all of which have a huge number of freely available resources online for learning.¡°Our role in this is to remove the barriers between idea and creation, making these tools immediately usable. Then you can take this knowledge and skill to go on to make things beyond the Pip platform.¡±They also noted that Pip is also ¡°still a Pi¡± ? meaning users ¡°can easily swap the SD card, and Pip can become a capable desktop computer (when connected to a monitor, mouse and keyboard), or even a portable RetroPie-powered emulation station¡±.Having a goal to support open standards and standard programming languages could indeed make for a device with greater longevity and utility than a learn to code gadget that only supports ¡®programming¡¯ via a proprietary and over simplified code blocks system (say), which a child may soon outgrow.Although very many learn to code devices will fail to make any serious dent in learning outcomes without the support of educational institutions to establish use of the device within a more structured learning environment ? to counteract the problem of individual kids getting bored and putting the toy away in a drawer.Pip¡¯s co-founders are initially targeting the product at parents (and/or ¡®big kid¡¯ makers) but say their long term goal is to get the product (and accompanying subscription-based software platform) into educational institutions.¡°The software has been developed in such a way that students can write code and test it on whatever equipment the school has available, before running it on Pip itself ? this means that schools are not forced to purchase one Pip for every student,¡± they noted.The bootstrapping team has been developing Pip since late 2016, taking in some support from Scottish Enterprise?but without any formal investors.At this stage they say they¡¯ve built?five working prototypes of their pre-production v5 model ? including ¡°custom circuit board built around the Raspberry Pi Compute Module and associated peripherals, high resolution touchscreen, built-in battery, six-piece resin-cast case with integrated kickstand¡±.Though there¡¯s clearly still a long way to turn the prototype into shipping product.They have a Kickstarter timeline of August-September 2018 for shipping Pip to backers. But as ever with crowdfunding campaigns the usual strong caveats apply: You¡¯re making a bet on an idea that may never come to fruition. Many crowdfunded projects fail entirely to deliver.Hardware can also be especially complex. And even if a device makes it, it may take longer than expected and not be exactly what was originally billed ? so, if you are happy to take a punt, it also pays to expect delays and not get too hung up on specific details."

The release of Echo hardware has been long awaited by America¡¯s northern neighbor, which could only watch and wait as Echo went through two generations in the U.S.Echo Dot, the second generation Echo and the Echo Plus with integrated smart home hub are all on sale in Canada as of today, compete with full Alexa voice assistant support. The Dot is $49.99 for a limited time (regular $69.99), the Echo is $99.99 (normally $129.99) and the Plus is $169.99 ($199.99 normally).The launch also comes alongside amazon opening a dedicated smart home devices store in Canada, and offering access to Amazon Prime Music for Canadians, with over 1 million songs available to stream free for Prime members.A lot of Canadians are already using Alexa and Echo, having procured them from US retailers or third parties who will ship across the border, but this has always involved workarounds like having a US Amazon account. Echo finally being available to Canadians officially is a big step, and is likely to strike a chord with customers. Google Home launched in the market earlier this year, too, so now consumers have some variety in their smart home speaker options.Devices are on sale now, but will start to ship at the beginning of December"
153,gadgets,"Ahead of 2017¡¯s present buying season, UK consumer rights group Which? has warned parents about the risks of giving connected toys to their children, and called for devices with known security and/or privacy risks to be banned from sale on kids safety grounds.Working with security researchers the group has spent the past 12 months investigating several popular Bluetooth or wi-fi toys that are on sale at major retailers, and says it found ¡°concerning vulnerabilities¡± in several devices that could ¡°enable anyone to effectively talk to a child through their toy¡±.It¡¯s published?specific findings on four of the toys it looked at: Namely the Furby Connect; I-Que Intelligent Robot; Toy-fi Teddy; and CloudPets cuddly toy.The latter toy drew major criticism from security experts in February when it was discovered that its maker had stored thousands of unencrypted voice recordings of kids and parents using the toy in a publicly accessible online database ? with no authentication required to access the data. (Data was subsequently deleted and ransomed.)Which? says in all cases it was found to be far too easy for someone to illicitly pair their own device to the toys and use the tech to talk to a child. It especially highlights Bluetooth connections not having been properly secured ? noting for example there was no requirement for a user to enter a password, PIN code or any other authentication to gain access.¡°That person would need hardly any technical know-how to ¡®hack¡¯ your child¡¯s toy,¡± it writes. ¡°Bluetooth has a range limit, usually 10 meters, so the immediate concern would be someone with malicious intentions nearby. However, there are methods for extending Bluetooth range, and it¡¯s possible someone could set up a mobile system in a vehicle to trawl the streets hunting for unsecured toys.¡±In the case of the Furby, Which?¡¯s external security researchers also thought it would be possible for someone to re-engineer its firmware to turn the toy into a listening device due to a vulnerability they found in the toy¡¯s design (which it¡¯s not publicly disclosing).Although they were not themselves able to do this during the time they had for the investigation.Which? describes its findings as ¡°the tip of a very worrying iceberg¡± ? also flagging other concerns raised over kids¡¯ IoT devices from several European regulatory bodies.Last month, for example, the Norwegian Consumer Council warned over similar security and privacy concerns pertaining to kids¡¯ smartwatches.This summer the?FBI?also issued a consumer notice warning that IoT toys ¡°could?put the privacy and safety of children at risk due to the large amount of personal information that may be unwittingly disclosed¡±.¡°You wouldn¡¯t let a young child play with a smartphone unsupervised and our investigation shows parents need to apply the same level of caution if considering giving a child a connected toy,¡± said Alex Neill, Which?

155,gadgets,"When goTenna put out their Mesh device earlier this year, I thought the off-grid communication gadgets would be great for an emergency kit or back-country hike. But it turns out that both I and goTenna underestimated how hungry people were for a resilient, user-powered mesh network: thousands of dedicated nodes now populate cities across the country, and volunteers are using them to get Puerto Rico back online after a devastating hurricane season.The Mesh works a lot like the original goTenna, which pairs to your phone using Bluetooth, then uses walkie-talkie radio frequencies to send text communications (no cell network necessary) to another device paired to someone else¡¯s phone ? perhaps a mile or two away.What the Mesh added was the ability to relay those messages: a chain or group of the devices will hear the message (it¡¯s encrypted, of course) and pass it on until it reaches its destination. You can even set up your Mesh as a stationary relay, which in concert with other devices might let entire neighborhoods or even cities communicate, even in cases of a power or telecommunications outage.I¡¯ve always found mesh networks compelling, but I just sort of assumed they would emerge out of the proliferation of wireless devices we already have: phones, routers, laptops. But so far no one has been able to unify the clans and produce some kind of universal relay protocol. The goTenna Mesh, of course, is built for it out of the box. (I have a couple of units they sent me to review, but have only had the chance to test the most basic features.)When I talked to Daniela Perdomo, founder and CEO of goTenna, around the time of the Mesh launch, a handful of early users had registered their devices on a map and forum the company started, called IMeshYou. The volume of users creating permanent nodes took the company by surprise, and both the map and Mesh firmware were updated to accommodate them.¡°What I didn¡¯t expect is that the long-term potential would be so obvious to other people so early on, this power to create your own networks,¡± said Perdomo. And sure enough, the map has exploded with devices.The exact number of nodes changes regularly, as only some are permanent ¡°fixed relays¡± (indicated by a lightning bolt) and the others may come and go. But it¡¯s clearly a popular use case for the people who have bought a Mesh device ? numbering nearly 100,000 now, Perdomo revealed.¡°The network layer we¡¯re creating here is new,¡± she said. ¡°Some people thought this was junk spectrum ? but we can create an always available, bottom up, decentralized mesh network like this. If things go down, you can¡¯t have Netflix, but you can say ¡®hey, meet me here.¡¯ ¡±You could deploy it one time and forget about it; a solar-powered stationary relay will operate continuously or wait patiently until it¡¯s needed.It turns out that¡¯s a particularly compelling use case when you live on, say, an island where the communications infrastructure has been devastated by a series of hurricanes. The company has embraced the opportunity to help the disconnected citizens of Puerto Rico, and to show the potential of a user-powered telecommunications network.¡°After the hurricane, reports were that 93 percent of telecommunications were down, and I can tell you, it felt like 100%,¡± explained Javier Malav?, director of the PR Reconnects project. ¡°I drove around and all the antennas were down, the satellite dishes were down, the transport and backbone layers were down.¡±In other words, it wasn¡¯t just about getting a generator to power up cell towers ? generators and fuel were hard enough to come by anyway ? even if you could, they wouldn¡¯t be able to connect to the backbone. Especially in the inland communities where infrastructure was already tenuous, people were completely disconnected.¡°If you don¡¯t have backhaul, forget about Wi-Fi or internet,¡± he said. ¡°After a little brainstorming, we thought the best solution would be something that can provide at least text communication in an area.¡±He had heard of goTenna and decided to ask them for help; after a pilot campaign, goTenna and?Malav? launched the PR Reconnects crowdfunding campaign on Razoo. Perdomo said that she was excited to be able to help out. (goTenna has also sent devices to Houston and the U.S. Virgin Islands.)¡°Part of my reason for starting goTenna was Hurricane Sandy,¡± she said. ¡°So it¡¯s really personally fulfilling to see something that came out of a storm like this¡¦ you know, help people in a storm like this.¡±They shipped down some devices to help Malav? and a couple of volunteers mesh up San Juan ? no small task, he noted, owing to the way the city is constructed.This looks like a good spot¡°In Puerto Rico we basically live in basically RF bunkers,¡± he said. If you just have an RF device in the living room of your place in the city, ¡°the signal won¡¯t even make it out of your house.¡±¡°We had to actually map things out,¡± he continued. ¡°We talked with an agronomist who drove us around and found spots where you had line of sight to other places. We went house by house asking people to let us have access to their roof to put a solar charger and a goTenna.¡±Getting people on the app was similarly challenging. With no internet, they couldn¡¯t download it, and while sideloading was sometimes an option, people are unlikely to just hand over their phone and say ¡°Sure, attach your weird flash drive and load up some software I¡¯ve never heard of.¡±So they ended up having to cut the Gordian Knot: ¡°We just bought iPod touches.¡± Expensive, but the idea wasn¡¯t to get every single citizen back online, just restore some basic conveniences.Barranquitas is a small town located in the mountainous center of the island, where lacking telecommunications the people were getting information around the old-fashioned way: walking. ¡°The parish has this organic network of communication,¡± said Malav?. But a handful of goTenna devices in strategic locations made it so that, for instance, instead of walking 40 minutes to the hospital to ask for medical aid, a person could walk 3 minutes to the church, where they could send a message to the hospital instantly.So far the volunteer group has a bunch of devices around San Juan and is working with a few smaller communities to set up small networks like the one in Barranquitas. They¡¯ve also set up endpoints at places where connectivity can be relied on ? a working satellite connection that can send text messages (the Mesh can act as an SMS gateway, sending texts coming from locations where there¡¯s no signal) or connect to web tool APIs like Twitter¡¯s. Like Perdomo says, it¡¯s not Netflix, but in the aftermath of a storm, Netflix is pretty low on the list of priorities.If you¡¯d like to help out, feel free to donate to PR Reconnects or send over a spare solar charger or Mesh device if you have one.A very different approach to reestablishing communication, Google¡¯s Loon project claims to have connected 100,000 people via balloons launched after the storms; but the balloons really act as a bridge between phones and distant, working cell networks. Lacking those (the backhaul Malav? mentioned), the system wouldn¡¯t be able to do much ? although in this case it looks like they were able to. But judging from the Google blog post, it looks like it was fantastically expensive to do and took weeks to get into action.A Loon balloon being launched in Nevada ahead of going online over Puerto RicoA one-time setup cost, perhaps in the tens of thousands, for a mesh network (goTenna or not) could provide an entire city and much of the surrounding area with basic text communication, one of the most critical capabilities following a natural disaster.But perhaps we won¡¯t have to: considering the popularity of the goTenna Mesh and the tendency of its users to buy three or four and set one up as a relay, it might be that major cities will already be meshed up by motivated users before the next storm hits.¡°When disasters like this are in the mainstream consciousness, it allows us to have interesting conversations about infrastructure,¡± said Perdomo. ¡°These events feel extraordinary, but really, they happen every day ? and we should be asking questions about the resilience of our infrastructure. A key part of that going forward is distributed systems, wind and solar and all that, but people aren¡¯t having that conversation about communications. No particular network is the be-all, end-all, but I think the future of communications includes a peer to peer layer.¡±And perhaps in the end, Perdomo suggested, goTenna will actually make its own hardware obsolete:¡°Today our phones don¡¯t allow us to do what goTenna does, but we¡¯re going to prove that they should be able to.¡±"

But iPhone Qi charging is currently limited to 5W, or the slowest wireless charging speed. Apple is currently working on iOS 11.2 ? this update is going to support 7.5W charging, as MacRumors spotted.Wireless charging is nice if you don¡¯t want to plug in your phone every time you want to charge it. But it¡¯s not a groundbreaking feature as you still have to plug your charger to the wall. You also need to put your phone on the charger. So it¡¯s not really wireless.But if you tend to pick up your phone very often and the cable gets in the way, you might want a wireless charger for your desk or nightstand. When new iPhones came out, Apple said that they would only support 5W charging for now.Apple is currently testing iOS 11.2 with beta testers, and this update unlocks wireless charging speed. 5W wireless charging is more or less as fast as using the charger accessory that comes with the iPhone.MacRumors tested iOS 11.2 with a 7.5W charger and a 5W charger. After the update, wireless charging with a 7.5W charger was 43 percent faster.This is encouraging and more useful than wireless charging in its current form. Apple currently sells a Mophie and a Belkin charger in its stores. Both support 7.5W charging. Some chargers on Amazon also support 10W or even 15W. It won¡¯t be any use for now, but maybe next year¡¯s iPhone is going to get improved wireless charging.And if you like cables, don¡¯t forget that you can use a 10/12W iPad charger to charge your iPhone in no time.

It also lets you do selfies in Portrait mode. According to a new Bloomberg report, Apple now wants to improve the rear camera with 3D-sensing capabilities.Bloomberg says that Apple won¡¯t use the exact same technology in the rear sensor. The iPhone X currently projects a grid of thousands of laser dots and look at the distorsion of those dots on your face.This rumored 3D sensor would project laser dots and calculate how long it takes to bounce back and come back to the phone. Apple currently uses two cameras to understand what¡¯s closer to you.But this new system would be much more accurate. Your phone could understand your surrounding and create a rough 3D map of your environment. It would be quite useful for ARKit and other augmented reality features.Apple is getting serious about augmented reality ? Bloomberg also reported that the company has been working on an AR headset. Adding new AR capabilities to the iPhone could be a great way to convince people to buy an AR headset in a few years.It reminds me of Google¡¯s Project Tango. It never really took off and Google pivoted to ARCore. But the idea behind Project Tango might live on with Apple¡¯s upcoming phones.

You now have a few options, including a new $49.99 accessory from voice tech company Speak Music, which is launching Muse, essentially a Bluetooth-enabled Amazon Echo for the car. The small device allows you to access Alexa skills while on the go, using voice commands and the ¡°Alexa¡± wake word, while connecting to your in-car stereo system via Bluetooth, aux input or USB.Muse uses your smartphone¡¯s data connection to connect to the Alexa service, which in turn provides you the ability to stream music, listen to live streaming radio stations, command your smart home gadgets while you¡¯re away or even make hands-free calls. You can also get news briefings, listen to audiobooks, add to your shopping list, check the weather and more.The Muse ships with a dual socket car USB charger for power, and a magnetic mounting kit. It¡¯s a small, circular gadget which should be relatively easy to stick somewhere on your dash, and it has back and forward buttons as well as a microphone button for physical activation (though it passively listens for the Alexa wake word, too).There are other methods for getting Amazon¡¯s voice assistant in your car, including first-party support from some manufacturers, but also via accessories like the Garmin Speak with Alexa, which became available just last month. The Speak also has full access to Amazon¡¯s skill library, but builds in Garmin voice-based turn-by-turn navigation and a small, simple OLED screen too for $150, too. You could also plug an Echo Dot into power and connect it to your Smartphone via hotspot.Muse is the same price as an Echo Dot, however, and offers all the same Alexa functionality, with a form factor and features designed for the car.

According to Kuo, this new iPhone would feature a 5.8-inch display with a density of 458 pixels per inch. This is exactly the same specifications as the current display in the iPhone X.But if a 5.8-inch display is not enough, KGI Securities thinks there will be a bigger phone with a 6.5-inch display. It¡¯ll also be an OLED display with a pixel density of 480-500 pixels per inch. In other words, there might be a second-gen iPhone X Plus.That¡¯s not all. Apple doesn¡¯t plan to focus on high-end phones that cost $1,000 or more. The company is also going to release a successor to the iPhone 8. But Apple plans to bring some of the innovations in the iPhone X to this new device.This lower-end iPhone (but still very expensive) could cost between $649 and $749 and feature an edge-to-edge display with a notch. But there will be tradeoffs. For instance, you can expect a traditional LCD display with a lower resolution (roughly 320 to 330 pixels per inch).It could have a 6.1-inch display, which would make it slightly bigger than the iPhone X.

No one seems to know what causes it or how prevalent it actually is. I¡¯ve asked Apple for comment.We can at least speculate on one part of that. iPhone Xs have a new diamond sub-pixel pattern in their displays, and as such all green sub-pixels appear in lines, while red and blue alternate. You can see that in this image taken as part of DisplayMate¡¯s tests:It seems likely that an electrical fault in a few phones is causing voltage to flow to all the green sub-pixels in a line. That it stretches all the way from top to bottom suggests it¡¯s something at the edge of the display that¡¯s sending an incorrect voltage down a few lines of pixels (if it were just one line of sub-pixels, it would appear much thinner). The line tends to be close to the right or left side of the phone, but that¡¯s harder to diagnose.This kind of issue always pops up in ambitious devices that use several new kinds of tech at scale. It happened to Samsung last year, except the line was pink. Even if only 0.001 percent of the displays they put together were faulty, a frequency that¡¯s nearly impossible to test for, a few users will still end up with a bum phone.One such user already reports that their phone was replaced at the Apple store, so it seems unlikely that this is a software issue.

That¡¯s why we¡¯re excited to announce that Parrot founder and CEO Henri Seydoux will join us on stage at?TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin?on December 4-5, 2017.When I last interviewed Seydoux, he looked back at the origin story of the first drones. He realized that he could re-use the same sensors and processors that you can find in a smartphone.But instead of building phones, you could take advantage of the accelerometers, gyroscopes, wireless chips and energy-efficient processors to power tiny quadcopters. Since then, drones have become a big industry. It¡¯s hard to find a reality TV show without drone shots now.Things worked well for a while. Parrot managed to sell a ton of consumer drones and it quickly became a great gift for the holiday season. But increased competition and shrinking margins led to some difficult decisions.It hasn¡¯t always been a smooth ride for Parrot. In January, the company laid off 35 percent of its drone team to focus on commercial drones. The company has made a few acquisitions to become a key player in this space. SenseFly, Airinov, MicaSense and Pix4D are now all owned by Parrot.And now, Parrot sells integrated software and hardware solutions for very special use cases. Just two weeks ago, Parrot released drones for firefighters and farmers. You can also imagine using drones for 3D modeling, inspection, deliveries and more.Those products can be expensive as Parrot controls the software platform. But it still feels like tech companies are scratching the surface when it comes to commercial drones.

If there¡¯s been one thing missing on the Switch experience, which is fantastic overall, it¡¯s the availability of streaming media services, since it¡¯s a great portable media player and a fantastic way to watch content on bigger screens while travelling, for instance.Hulu was listed alongside a few other relatively unremarkable game titles on the list of launch titles for the November 9 update. It¡¯s a free download, as you¡¯d expect, and there¡¯s also a free trial available for users new to the service, but then it¡¯ll require a paid subscription as it does on other platforms.Hopefully this means that other services will make their way to the console soon, including Netflix. A Netflix app with the ability to download and store TV shows and movies for offline viewing, a feature offers on Netflix¡¯s Android and iOS apps, would be fantastic for making the portable console an even better travel companion."
166,gadgets,"A driverless shuttle set free in downtown Las Vegas was involved in a minor accident less than an hour after it hit the streets, reported the local NBC affiliate KSNV. Not really the kind of publicity you want, or that self-driving cars need.The shuttle, an egglike 8-seater Navya, is operated by the AAA and Keolis. It was a test deployment along half a mile of the Fremont East ¡°Innovation District,¡± so this thing wasn¡¯t cruising the strip. Probably a good thing.Now, it must be said that technically the robo-car was not at fault. It was struck by a semi that was backing up, and really just grazed ? none of the passengers was hurt.Like any functioning autonomous vehicle, the shuttle can avoid obstacles and stop in a hurry if needed. What it apparently can¡¯t do is move a couple feet out of the way when it looks like a 20-ton truck is going to back into it.A passenger interviewed by KSNV shared her frustration:The shuttle just stayed still and we were like, ¡®oh my gosh, it¡¯s gonna hit us, it¡¯s gonna hit us!¡¯ and then.. it hit us! And the shuttle didn¡¯t have the ability to move back, either. Like, the shuttle just stayed still.Surely this situation is not so rare that the shuttle¡¯s designers did not allow for it? Moving the car out of the way of an oncoming vehicle seems like a pretty elementary safety measure.A City of Las Vegas representative issued a statement that the shuttle ¡°did what it was supposed to do, in that its sensors registered the truck and the shuttle stopped to avoid the accident.¡± It also claims, lamely, that ¡°Had the truck had the same sensing equipment that the shuttle has the accident would have been avoided.¡±Not if it failed to react properly, as arguably was the case with the shuttle. Testing will continue, but I have to say I wouldn¡¯t get on this thing until they demonstrate that it can do more than just stop."

Yet it has never been done, and likely never will be. Reflex is the latest to try, though, with a brand new 35mm camera built for the modern, smartphone-toting photographer.The idea behind the crowdfunding campaign was to create a sort of system-agnostic film SLR. The Reflex¡¯s modular build means you can swap out the lens mount for any of the majors: Canon, Nikon, Pentax and so on. Bigger lens selection is always good, but is that enough to make people want to buy in?To sweeten the pot, the project is offering as Kickstarter rewards (in addition to the camera, of course) refurbished off-brand (but still well-known) lenses: a Helios-44 56mm f/2 and a Pentacon 50mm F/1.8. It¡¯s a fun bonus and the results should be interesting.The film back is removable as well, but you have to stick to 35mm; you can¡¯t swap in 120 or something.In front you have a regular flash but also an LED illuminator that gives a steady light. That¡¯s definitely not something you found on SLRs in the ¡¯70s, but it could prove useful.The most modern component has to be the Bluetooth unit. If the project hits ?150,000, an app will be developed that the camera will sync its settings to, letting you know exactly what settings you had for a given shot. I would have preferred an electronically activated shutter for time-lapse, app-triggered exposures, and so on ? but maybe that proved too hard to implement.The magnesium alloy body has a sort of generic look to it, but I¡¯m glad to see there¡¯s a grip bump on the right and a secondary shutter release on the front. The viewfinder is a x0.86 magnification prism, but the focus glass style is ¡°still under debate.¡±But why buy one of these instead of getting a used 35mm camera just about anywhere and using that? I couldn¡¯t really tell you ? they both seem like perfectly good options if you want to shoot film.The advantage of the Reflex is of course its flexibility ? it would be fun for lens collectors ? but also the fact that it¡¯s new. Used cameras might have light leaks, old corroded batteries that are out of production, creaky or rusty mechanisms and so on ? mint condition isn¡¯t always an option if you don¡¯t want to pay top dollar. So for $450 you can get a Reflex and shoot film on something guaranteed to work well. At least, as much of a guarantee as you can get with something from Kickstarter.There may be interesting new accessories coming down the line as well: ¡°a range of accompanying accessories and technology¡± are on the way, apparently. That¡¯s assuming the crowdfunding effort succeeds, I imagine ? but at about 80 percent funded in one day, I¡¯d say they have a good chance. At the very least it¡¯s nice to see people attempting to bridge the analog/digital divide in photography."
168,gadgets,"Apple is reportedly working on a redesign of the iPad that includes dropping the Home button and slimming down the bezels on the top-end model, as well as adding facial recognition tech to allow for Face ID unlocking and more. Bloomberg says the redesigned iPad could make its consumer debut as early as next year.The upgraded tablet would likely sit at the top of the iPad line, which would probably make it an iPad Pro, and would not pack in an OLED screen in addition to the other changes it would inherit from the iPhone X. It¡¯s said to be similar in size to the 10.5-inch iPad Pro, at least (no word yet on a 12.9 version), with a release date late in the year.Dropping the home button on the iPad would allow for a larger screen in the same physical footprint. Apple already reduced the thickness of the edges on the 10.5-inch version vs. the 9.7-inch model it replaced, to maximize screen real estate, and it could go further still with additional space savings from reducing the ¡®chin¡¯ of the front of the device.Making OLED displays at scale for the new iPad would be too much of a technical and financial hurdle, according to the report, hence it not making the jump from iPhone X to iPad. But Face ID for unlocking will make its iPad debut, per Bloomberg¡¯s sources, along with improved internal specs, and a brand new version of the Apple Pencil.The report makes no mention of a ¡®notch¡¯ design that would eliminate most of the top bezel, as well. It¡¯s possible that this wouldn¡¯t make as much sense on a larger device like this which is often used for consuming video in landscape format.Obviously, Apple taking the technical achievements of its iPhone X and spreading them around its other products was bound to happen, but if it really is in the next iPad revision then Apple¡¯s moving pretty quickly to capitalize on its main iPhone X innovations."
169,gadgets,"Apple has updated its App Store support page with new metrics. As of November 6, 2017, iOS 11 is now installed on 52 percent of iPhones and iPads currently in use. 38 percent of devices still run iOS 10, and only 10 percent of people are using an earlier version of iOS.Apple usually updates this page quite quickly after the release of a major iOS update. This year, the company waited a bit as the iPhone X was released just last week, creating a new influx of iOS 11 users.And it looks like adoption rate is a bit slower this year. Last year, Apple reported roughly the same numbers on October 11 with 54 percent of users running iOS 10.The iPhone X could be part of the reason why it took longer to reach the same number. But my theory is that emojis are the main driving force when it comes to iOS updates.Last year, iOS 10.0 shipped with dozens of new emojis. This year, Apple added new emojis as part of iOS 11.1, which was released last week.Many users don¡¯t want to be left behind on the emoji front. It has become such an important part of pop culture that many users want to be able to see all emojis and not just question marks for missing characters.Still, 52 percent of market share in just a couple of months is quite impressive. Most Android users are still using Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Google released this version more than two years ago.Apple is currently working on iOS 11.2. This release should be available in just a few weeks and come with a major new features for U.S. customers ? Apple Pay Cash. This could be enough to push people to update."
170,gadgets,"Apple is working on technology that would enable it to build an augmented reality headset by 2019, with shipping targeted for as soon as 2020, according to a new report from Bloomberg. The device would be independent from Apple¡¯s iPhone or other mobile devices, with its own built-in display, OS (dubbed ¡®rOS¡¯ internally), and a new custom processor, per the report.Apple CEO Tim Cook has been bullish on the prospects of AR in past interviews, and iOS 11 includes a built-in feature to support the development of AR experiences called ARKit, which allows developers to easily leverage those features within its apps. Earlier reports from Bloomberg noted that Apple has hired on a number of AR experts, and that the team is being run by former Dolby Labs engineering executive Mike Rockwell.Recently, Cook told press that the technology is just not there yet for there to be an augmented reality headset available to consumers that offers a satisfying experience, while chiding ¡°anything you would see on the market any time soon¡± in that category. This likely refers obliquely to at least Windows HoloLens, if not other products also on the horizon like whatever Magic Leap ends up releasing.Apple is still firming up plans for this future device, per Bloomberg, but it¡¯s exploring various interaction methods including touch sensitive input, Siri voice interaction and even head gestures. The team are also building out applications, including messaging, virtual meetings, 360 video and navigation, and there are plans to potentially build out an App Store for the hardware.Testing is being done internally on the HTC Vive and a device that uses an iPhone screen but is similar to a Samsung Gear VR, per the report. Apple recently made its most recent Macs compatible with external GPUs and the HTC Vive for the purposes of developing VR content, so this seems like one motivating factor. The report also claims that Apple will release a new version of ARKit in 2018 that will pave the way for developers to begin building experiences that could target this device.Apple spins up a wide range of experimental projects, and not all of them result in shipping products. But Cook has spoken about AR and its future potential enough to suggest they have more than a passing interest in the technology."
171,gadgets,"Researchers at Dartmouth University have found that a 3D printed shape covered in aluminum foil can improve wireless range and increase Wi-Fi security. The project, which appeared on Eurekalert, involves placing a reflector on and around a Wi-Fi router¡¯s antennae to shape the beam, increasing range and preventing it from passing through to unwanted spaces.¡°With a simple investment of about $35 and specifying coverage requirements, a wireless reflector can be custom-built to outperform antennae that cost thousands of dollars,¡± said Xia Zhou, a Dartmouth assistant professor.In their paper, Zhou and her colleagues tested multiple styles of directional antennas and also tested an ¡°anecdotal¡± solution that involved sticking a soda can behind a router to shape the radio waves towards a target. After a few iterations, they were able to create specific shapes to increase Wi-Fi reception in specific rooms. They then created a program called WiPrint that 3D prints the exact shape needed to form the beams for better coverage and security. Once printed all you have to do is cover them in aluminum foil.The team found that their reflectors could accurately shape Wi-Fi beams to avoid some spaces and favor others, thereby increasing security and coverage. For example, you could shape your beam to avoid going out a window into the street but be stronger in a room nearby.They haven¡¯t yet released the software but rest assured that your grandpa was right: aluminum foil and antennas do mix."
172,gadgets,"BOLDR is a small watch company with a distinct style. Selling primarily on Kickstarter, the company has gone through a number of design iterations to land on the Expedition, a watch designed to take you to the farthest reaches of the Earth and/or the copier down the hall.The Expedition is reminiscent of some of the Hamilton Field Watches but it is improved immensely by color schemes that are designed to remind us of famous mountain ranges. The model I tested, the Fuji, featured a grey-on-grey design and orange hands and pips. The piece looks artfully faded, a style that comes from so-called ¡°tropical¡± Rolex watches that spent decades in the heat and sun.The watches range from the all-black Kilimanjaro to the surprisingly bright Eiger. Each have a Sellita SW200-1 automatic movement and Superluminova lume on the hands and pips. Early birds will pay $395 for one of these and each includes an internal crown for countdown timing and direction-setting.I found the watches to be quite well-made and, as I noted before, on par with anything Hamilton has been making in their Khaki Field line. While I¡¯m not a huge fan of three-handed pieces, the design, the lume, and the entire color scheme make this a hit. It¡¯s a bit small for my wrist ? 41mm is just a bit too wee for my meaty appendages ? but it¡¯s a nice beater watch that can stand everyday use including the occasional hike.On the whole it¡¯s rare for me to find a Kickstarter watch I truly like. This one hits on all the right notes ? history, design, provenance, and materials ? and the price for early birds is just about right. It¡¯s also great that the team is shipping quickly and they¡¯ve already surpassed their goal.While this watch might not tell you your current GPS coordinates, calorie count, or speed, it¡¯s nice to know that it will remain ticking long after your Apple Watch has rusted into a little hunk of steel and silicon."

This fierce flier can swoop for up to sixty minutes with the included batteries and a first-person view is available using Parrot¡¯s VR glasses and a cellphone.I was quite please with the drone¡¯s performance and I was especially enamored by the included Skycontroller 2, a handheld controller that lets you hold your phone while twiddling with the drone¡¯s joysticks. In fact I actually preferred controlling the drone with the controller rather than the phone, a first for me when it comes to more professional models.The Bebop 2 Power costs $599 and for that you get the FPV goggles, the controller, and two batteries. The drone has two modes ? sport and camera ? which slows things down or speeds things up depending on how fast you want to fly.I was pleasantly surprised by this thing and found it to be one of the best drones I¡¯ve flown in a while. It¡¯s well worth checking out."
174,gadgets,"What do you get if you combine the Internet of Things with the business of home insurance? U.K. startup Neos is hoping the answer is prevention rather than (just) payouts.Its home insurance product is intended to lean on sensor tech and wireless connectivity to reduce home-related risks ? like fire and water damage, break-ins and burglary ? by having customers install a range of largely third-party internet-connected sensors inside their home, included in the price of the insurance product. So it¡¯s a smart home via the insured backdoor, as it were.Customers also get an app?to manage the various sensors so they can monitor and even control some of the connected components, which can include motion sensors, cameras and smoke detectors.The Neos app is also designed to alert users to potentially problematic events ? like the front door being left open or water starting to leak under their kitchen sink ? the associated risk of which a little timely intervention might well mitigate.It sees additional revenue opportunity there too ? and is aiming to connect customers with repair services via its platform. So the service could?help a customer who¡¯s away on holiday arrange for a plumber to come in and fix their leaky sink, for example (there are no smart locks currently involved in the equation, though ? Neos customer can name trusted keyholders to be contacted in their absence).¡°The vision really is about moving insurance from a traditional claims, payout type solution¡¦ to one that¡¯s much more preventative, and technology¡¯s really the enabler for that,¡± says?co-founder Matt Poll. ¡°We also think that customers get quite a raw deal from their insurance company¡¦ for being a really good customer and not claiming¡¦ And no value.¡°So what we¡¯re trying to do is to provide value to customers throughout the term of their policy ? allowing them to monitor their own homes, using our cameras and the devices that we give them. If there is an issue, they¡¯ll get alerted. Most importantly they or us through our monitoring center and assistance service can put the things right¡¦ In that sense both the customer and us benefit if we¡¯re successful.¡±On the insurance cover front Poll claims there¡¯s no new responsibilities being placed on customers¡¯ shoulders ? despite all the sensor kit that¡¯s installed as part of the package. ¡°There¡¯s no responsibility placed on the customer. We¡¯re really clear about that,¡± he tells TechCrunch. ¡°Customers do ask this question ? oh what if I don¡¯t arm the alarm, does that mean I¡¯m not covered? And our answer is simply of course you¡¯re covered.¡±The startup was founded 18 months ago by Poll, an ex-insurance guy, combining with a more technical co-founder. The team market tested their proposition last year in and around London, partnering with Hiscox on the insurance product offering for that trial. They¡¯re now launching their own branded insurance offering nationwide.Neos is actually offering a range of home insurance products, including a combined contents plus buildings insurance offering (or either/or) across three pricing tiers ? aiming to support different levels of coverage and different types of customers, such as flat versus house dwellers, for example, or homeowners versus tenants.While it¡¯s generally aiming to be tech agnostic when it comes to which smart home sensors can be used ? supporting a range of third-party devices ? Neos has developed its own smart water valve, for example, as Poll says it couldn¡¯t find an appropriate existing bit of IoT kit in the market for that.¡°It uses machine learning to monitor an individual¡¯s water signature within their property over a period of a couple of weeks and then we can identify from that if there¡¯s any leaks ? small or large ? and most importantly if a leak does arrive the customer or our monitoring sensor can turn the water off remotely,¡± he notes.It¡¯s also built its own hub to control the firmware on the third-party devices its platform is integrating with.?¡°We want to put ourselves out there to give customers the best solution for the job and move as the market moves,¡± says Poll on Neos¡¯ overall philosophy toward hardware.Despite all this additional kit to be installed in customers¡¯ homes, Poll bills the insurance products as competitively priced (and positioned) versus more traditional insurance offerings. Neos¡¯ prices vary from ¡°approximately ?15 to ?50 per month,¡± which it says includes ¡°all the necessary hardware, 24/7 monitoring and assistance plus the comprehensive insurance cover.¡±¡°We¡¯ve got some good early traction and I think the price point that we¡¯ve come in at is attractive, and the value proposition is there,¡± says Poll, noting that the product will be on price comparison sites ¡°by the end of this month ? at the very latest,¡± as well as being offered through property website Zoopla, which is a distribution partner (and investor) in Neos.He also says the insurance quote process has been radically simplified by Neos drawing on a range of publicly available data so that potential customers don¡¯t have to answer a large number of questions just to get a quote.¡°We can actually give customers a full quote from just their postcode and their address,¡± he says. ¡°We use 261 different data sources¡¦ One of our partners and early investors is Zoopla. They have a lot of data that they provide us. We also use data from Landmark and Land Registry ? local authority data.¡°Because all this data¡¯s publicly available. We don¡¯t ultimately need to ask how many bedrooms or bathrooms you¡¯ve got ? in most cases we already know that data. Actually in most cases we know the square footage of your property which is a much more accurate predictor of risk anyway.¡±Another strand of the go-to-market approach is it¡¯s also working with existing insurance brands to white label its offering ? setting it up to scale more quickly into markets (and regulations) outside the U.K.¡°We¡¯re just about to launch an Aviva-backed solution,¡± says Poll. ¡°A lot of the big insurers are looking in this space but haven¡¯t done anything¡¦ So we¡¯ve had a lot of interest outside of just our direct Neos brand from larger insurers based here in the U.K., Europe and also in the U.S.¡±He says Neos is also hopeful of signing a ¡°large-scale partner in the U.S.¡± ? one of the top-five home insurance companies ? which would be a second strand to its white labeling/enterprise solution bow if they nail that deal down.¡°Markets like the U.S¡¦. are very different from a regulation point of view and cost of entry for a small business like us to enter, so that model makes sense. But we¡¯re very much ? certainly now and we¡¯ll always be ? focused on the Neos direct to consumer brand,¡± he adds.Poll says he¡¯s hoping for a minimum of ¡°tens of thousands¡± of customers within a year¡¯s time for Neos¡¯ B2C play ? and ¡°ideally¡± significant growth above that.?¡°If you add in the B2B play, as well, in terms of customers actually utilizing our platform I think the potential is significantly higher than that,¡± he adds.The startup has previously raised ?5 million in Series A funding led by Aviva Ventures and with BBC sporting personality Gary Lineker also investing. As well as Zoopla, another strategic partnership is with Munich Re, which also invested.Interesting takeaways from its beta period include that customers were keen to have help installing all the sensor kit (Neos is offering an installation service for a fixed price if users don¡¯t want to fit the kit relying on its instructions themselves), and that security concerns appeared to be more of a smart home driver for the product than risks such as water leaks, so Neos tweaked some of the sensor bundles it¡¯s now offering.Poll also says customer feedback from the trial pushed it to offer a fix on premiums for their first three years (assuming a customer makes no claims) to reassure potential customers that it isn¡¯t seeking to use smart home hardware to lock them in to its products and then quickly inflate premiums.¡°It¡¯s interesting how customer perceptions are,¡± he says, arguing there¡¯s ¡°a mistrust of the insurance industry as a whole¡± ? which is something else Neos is hoping can be fixed with a little IoT-enabled preventative visibility."
175,gadgets,"Lab tests on the recently released iPhone X put Apple¡¯s new flagship in the highest tiers of quality when it comes to the display and camera, but it¡¯s only in the former category that it truly leaves the competition behind. Of course, what¡¯s the point of having great images if your screen can¡¯t show them properly?Apple doesn¡¯t tend to make their own displays; but while LG, Sharp and, in the iPhone X¡¯s case, Samsung rightfully deserve credit for making them, Apple doesn¡¯t just snatch them off the shelf. A ton of money and time is spent customizing and tweaking them, and phones are individually calibrated before they ship to account for variation in the manufacturing process.DisplayMate¡¯s battery of tests aims at testing the absolute color accuracy, brightness and other objective measures of a display. And by those measures the latest iPhone beats out even the latest OLED displays from Samsung, their parent company, as it were.OLEDs naturally excel in a number of categories, from contrast to color accuracy, and Apple¡¯s software emphasizes these strengths. Its color accuracy in particular is the best DisplayMate has tested. And conveniently, it switches to the correct color profile or gamut depending on the content, meaning you won¡¯t see images intended for display in sRGB shown through the lens of Adobe or DCI-P3.The iPhone X pretty much nails the whole expanded gamut with no weaknesses in any area whatsoever.If that doesn¡¯t mean anything to you, don¡¯t worry ? the whole point is you don¡¯t need to be aware of it, and instead can simply be sure that photos, movies, games and so on will be seen exactly as they should be. All the same, you might want to spend a little time in the display options, since automatic white balance may throw off viewers sensitive to that kind of thing (me, for instance).One change to the display tech that may be considered lateral is the move to diamond sub-pixels. Each pixel in digital displays, as you may know, is generally made up of a number of sub-pixels: different numbers and shapes of red, blue and green that illuminate to various degrees to form in aggregate the colors we perceive.For LCDs this often takes the form of an RGB grid, generally with a square composed of a red, a green, a blue, then maybe another green sub-pixel, or something like that. This has worked well but leads to certain patterns of aliasing, or pixelation. Different sub-pixel layouts produce different aliasing patterns.The iPhone X¡¯s sub-pixel layout is different from every previous iPhone in that the pixels are diamond-shaped and arranged in a diagonally symmetrical grid rather than rectangular and on a rectangular grid:This is a super-close-up of the OLED sub-pixels.Now, ever since the advent of >300 PPI screens, aliasing is much less of a problem than it once was. But some kinds of aliasing are preferable to others, and it happens that the type exhibited by the iPhone X (and others in diamond or Pentile arrangement) is not ideal for vertical and horizontal lines.This comparison shot taken for iMore¡¯s review of the phone illustrates this:Definitely view this at full size if you want to see the difference.On diagonals and round edges, the diamond pattern makes for a more natural curve without stair-stepping. But in straight horizontal and vertical lines, you end up with a sawtooth pattern.That is, if you look at the phone through a microscope. While sawtooth aliasing was a problem back on the original Galaxy S, we¡¯ve come a long way and pixel pitch is much smaller now, making the pattern, while it¡¯s still there, much less noticeable. (I also say this having not looked at the thing in real life, and no one has complained so far that I know of.)DxOMark has tested all the flagships this year with a new set of mobile-focused tests, and while these semi-synthetic metrics should always be taken with a grain of salt, these people know what they¡¯re doing and are of course unregenerate pixel-peepers.The iPhone X surpasses the previous high score in still photos, very narrowly beating out the Galaxy Note 8 and Huawei Mate 10 Pro; it¡¯s also better than the iPhone 8 Plus, which was itself briefly a high-water mark. So it¡¯s excellent, as our review found.As you might expect in a phone with a fantastic screen, color and contrast are particularly well captured. However, like other Apple devices, its shutter lag was frequently longer than the competition ? particularly the Pixel 2, which set a new bar for autofocus speed and precision.It lost points in extreme low light, where it was also bested by the Pixel 2, and its flash portraits seem to be regularly underexposed. This is where it also lost points in video: noise and underexposure marked its 1080p/30 video.It seems as though under good conditions, though, the iPhone X is as unimpeachable as both its predecessors and competition."

177,gadgets,"Bang & Olufsen¡¯s headphones tend to stand out from the crowd, and their new fully wireless mode, the Beoplay E8, is no exception. The E8 is easily the best totally wire-free headphone I¡¯ve used thus far, with comfortable earbuds that should fit regardless of your ear shape, good battery life of around four hours per charge and the best sound quality of any true wireless buds I¡¯ve tested ? and I¡¯ve tested a lot.The Beoplay E8 are diminutive and understated, making for a far better in-ear look than Apple¡¯s somewhat ridiculous-looking AirPods, and they come with a charging case with a full recharge for the buds built in, making for total unplugged play time of 8 hours before you have to find an outlet. The case itself is head and shoulders above the competition, too, with a sleek, pebbled leather outer and no fiddling required to get the buds inserted within for a good connection to their charging contacts.B&O has also done a great job with the companion app for the Beoplay E8, offering easy presets and manually configurable equalizer settings so you can tune the sound based on your preferences or the type of content you¡¯re using them to listen to. The app also uses Bluetooth LE for a super easy out of the box pairing experience, which is only marginally more challenging than Apple¡¯s W1-enabled near-field pairing for the AirPods.In the box, B&O also crucially includes Comply isolating foam earbud tips for the headsets themselves, which really up the game in terms of audio quality. I generally recommend using Comply tips if you want to be able to focus on sound quality with any pair of earbuds, but often they¡¯re only available as an aftermarket add-on, so it¡¯s great to have them included right alongside the other tip options here.Another big benefit here versus some other options are intuitive, touch-based controls built right into the headset. You don¡¯t have to press a physical button into your ear as a result, and the top controls are easy enough to manage once you follow the in-app instructions to learn how to use them to control playback, volume, transparency modes and more. Speaking of transparency, that¡¯s another standout here: You can tap once on the left bud to enable audio passthrough, ensuring you can go about your business during the day without theoretically ever having to take the earbuds out, while, for instance, shopping or paying for a transit ticket.The Beoplay E8s come in either a black or a charcoal sand color; I reviewed the black ones and they¡¯re ideal for anyone hoping to get the most out of truly wireless buds while remaining relatively discreet about their use. Either look is good, however, and the matching case is also terrific to look at.The E8s are also very capable when it comes to using your phone¡¯s virtual assistant, including Siri, and when making calls. People I spoke to reported good sound quality on the other end, using the built-in microphones on the small buds.B&O¡¯s offering is a bit pricier than some of the other options out there, including AirPods, at $299, but they deliver unmatched sound quality in this category for that price, as well as reliable, rock-solid connectivity and great sound customization features. If what you¡¯re after is truly wireless earbuds, and your primary qualification in making a buying decision is that they be the best available all-around, the Beoplay E8 definitely fits the bill."

A few of us over here at TechCrunch received our new toys today and wanted to share some initial thoughts with y¡¯all.Leggo.First up, Megan Rose Dickey, the lunatic who at one point told co-workers she felt like she was on drugs during her initial iPhone X exploration:I could barely sleep last night because I knew that at some point today, my iPhone X would arrive. After getting showered and dressed, I went on over to my parents¡¯ place, where I was set to receive the shipment.FedEx arrived around 11am PT this morning and I promptly lost my shit. The first thing I did, obviously, was try out the animoji. Here¡¯s one I sent to my colleague Darrell Etherington.The animoji are great, but now I want anibitmoji, ya know? Anyway, the Face ID works like magic and I love it.Next up, Sarah Buhr, who did not feel she was on drugs but was definitely grinning from ear-to-ear when the UPS guy arrived today:My previous phone was an iPhone 6 with a hairline crack on the screen I never bothered to fix so the X was a much needed upgrade. It¡¯s also a beautiful piece of machinery. I¡¯m still setting it up this afternoon but so far Face ID seems to work very well. It even recognizes me with glasses on or off.The camera lives up to the hype, too. Hi-res, high-quality. I took a pic of my living room against the window and the light and color still balanced well. Nice touch!One thing I would like to skip is the need to swipe up after the phone IDs your face. The swiping takes some getting used to and there¡¯s a lot of swiping with this phone. Why not just ID my face and let me in?And Darrell Etherington, who reserved the phone for pick-up in-store first thing Friday morning so he could check out the launch-day hype in person:This iPhone replaces the iPhone 8 Plus I had been using (which is now on its way to a new home with my dad). It¡¯s already a huge step-up from the Plus line for me just because of the size, since it¡¯s a lot smaller without sacrificing much screen real estate.I, too, love the Animoji ? I¡¯ve been using them like you¡¯d use voice messages on WhatsApp or WeChat, since they¡¯re incredibly easy to record and I feel like if I¡¯m asking about dinner plans it¡¯s just better coming from a pig or a panda.I¡¯m also surprised at how quickly I adapted to Face ID, which I never thought would even approach Touch ID in terms of convenience. I now already find myself assuming it¡¯s going to work on the 8 Plus and my iPad Pro, and taking a minute to remember to use my thumb or finger instead.Fitz Tepper depended on the hospitality of his hotel and a backup order to make absolutely sure he was ready and armed with iPhone X on day one of availability:I¡¯m pretty weird about needing to get Apple devices the morning they come out. Old-timers will remember my first-ever post on TC was when I camped out at the only store in the U.S. to have the Apple Watch on launch day.SO, when I found out I¡¯d be in Chicago for a conference on the big day, I had to prepare accordingly. I stayed up until 3am on preorder day and somehow managed to get one sent to my hotel, and another one to my house. The idea was that my flight back home was at 4pm, and there was no way I¡¯d be thwarted by a late UPS delivery. Worst case I¡¯d just have the hotel ship me the second one to return or give to a family member.Anyways, I¡¯m just now getting it up and running ? and my only initial thoughts are regarding the size and screen. It¡¯s so small! Coming from many years of using iPhone pluses, it¡¯s weird typing on a smaller keyboard. Of course the trade-off is that the device itself feels great, and fits perfectly in your hand.One other weird thing that¡¯s going to take getting used to ? no home button. I have 10 years of home button muscle memory, and that¡¯s definitely not going to be fixed overnight.We¡¯re by no means trying to sell you on the iPhone X. It¡¯s super expensive and a lot of us will be paying it off for quite some time. But if you like the latest and greatest technology, this is it. Check out TC¡¯s official iPhone X review here."
180,gadgets,"Meural¡¯s second-generation Canvas digital art display is now available, and I¡¯ve been testing one out for the past couple of weeks to see how it stacks up. This is my first experience with any kind of digital canvas product, and I have to admit I had very low expectations going into it ? but the Meural is actually an outstanding gadget, provided you have the means to commit to it, including the base price of purchase and the add-on subscription that Meural also launched to keep it populated with a broad library of content.The Meural Canvas retails for $595 or $695 depending on your preferred frame finish, and includes a 27-inch diagonal full HD (1080P) display. The screen features a glare-free finish, a maximum brightness of 300c/m2, and an auto-dimming feature to help it match the ambient light in the room. The frame also includes Wi-Fi connectivity, with up to 802.11 ac speeds across both 2.4GHz and 5GHz channels, and there¡¯s a computer inside powering the whole thing with a 1.8HGz Quad Core ARM processor, a Cortex-A17 graphics chip, 2GB of RAM and 8GB of onboard storage.The specs are good, but the best part about them is that once you¡¯re up and running with the Canvas (and setup is easy, using the companion mobile app to connect to your Wi-Fi in just a few minutes), you never have to think about them again. Canvas does its job so well you¡¯ll forget it¡¯s a wall-hanging computer, in fact, and come to think of it more like a magical painting whose contents can change, Harry Potter-style, in an instant ? and which even supports artwork with motion elements, including large-format cinemagraphs.Canvas¡¯ real strength is in its proprietary display tech, which combines that glare-free screen with intelligent matching for the room lighting and an uncanny ability to make digital images look like they¡¯re printed or even painted: Depending on your room lighting, the Meural hardware looks like it actually is a genuine painting, and the effect is particularly amazing in well-lit rooms with a lot of natural light.All of this comes at a slight cost in terms of installation requirements, since there¡¯s a power cord supplying the energy needed to run the Canvas. The included cord is a braided white nylon affair which is durable and relatively easy to hide away, however: I ran a cable holder like you might use for a wall-mounted TV to disguise mine, and I¡¯ve received a number of compliments on how well it blends in with the rest of the decor. And in terms of power costs, they¡¯re minimal ? the Canvas only uses the equivalent of less than half of that of a standard light bulb.The physical dimensions of the Canvas itself are also something you need to take into consideration when thinking about buying this, since it¡¯s 30.4-inches by 20-inches, which is likely to take up a decent amount of wall space for many. It was perfect for my high-ceiling apartment on the main floor of a house, however, and truly stands out as a decorative feature regardless of what¡¯s begin shown in the frame, especially in the attractive walnut frame finish ¡®Winslow¡¯ model I tested.To choose what your Meural Canvas shows, you can either navigate to the web interface or use the mobile app. On the web, you can browse a wide variety of collections curated by Meural, some of which are limited to its subscription service, which is available for $4.95 per month or $39.95 per year. The Mural Membership provides access to the entire library, and exclusive feature collections and editorial curation, however. Plus, if you don¡¯t want to pay, you can also upload any of your own art and organize it into playlists, too.Meural also offers a number of different options for how it displays art, including adjustable brightness (or automatic adaptive), duration of time each piece in a collection is shown, whether it¡¯ll rotate through the various collections you have on your Canvas, and whether it¡¯ll display horizontal/vertical/cropped images or any mix of the above.In the box, there¡¯s mounting hardware included which makes it dead simple to install, even if you¡¯re not particularly handy, and you can rotate the Canvas at any time using the clever anchor and frame mount design.Some critics have noted that Meural¡¯s Canvas might not have the highest resolution display (it¡¯s HD in an age of increasingly 4K and Retina screens), but this turned out to be a non-issue for me. The viewing distance for the screen is such that you¡¯re not going to notice any pixelation anyway, and the Meural team has focused on aspects that matter more, including even backlighting, adaptive brightness, proper color rendering and better viewing angles.One unexpected benefit of Meural¡¯s Canvas: It got me doing some with my own photography besides storing it in the cloud. I always have good intentions to print some of my favorite shots from my travel photography, but I never actually do ? on the Canvas, it¡¯s as easy as uploading the images via your desktop browser and creating your own playlists. You can even include photo credits and contextual details, in case you really want to show off.This might be the real target demo sweet spot for Canvas: Artists and photographers who want a personal showcase without the printing. But it¡¯s actually a fantastic addition to any household, provided spending $600 or so on a screen with a very specific purpose makes sense to you. Honestly, I didn¡¯t think it would with the Meural Canvas, but testing the latest generation of the digital frame proved otherwise."
181,gadgets,"The iPhone 8 may have been filled with the expected kit, but we¡¯ve all been looking forward to finding out what fun Apple¡¯s engineers had putting together the all-new iPhone X ? and it doesn¡¯t disappoint. iFixit¡¯s excellent-as-always teardown finds a wealth of strange new components inside the biggest redesign of the device in years.Right off the bat there¡¯s an interesting and first-time choice to split the battery into two parts ? it¡¯s mainly just to better use the space that¡¯s left over after budgeting for the volume of the other parts. It still comes out as a single piece, just a little more L-shaped than the usual rectangle.Users will be glad to hear that the Lightning port has been reinforced; it¡¯s given a little more space and structure inside the body of the phone, which should prevent it from wearing out so quickly.The front-facing camera array, essentially a miniaturized first-generation Kinect, doesn¡¯t have many surprises, but it¡¯s nice to see that it comes out relatively easily and in one piece.It¡¯s the logic board that really impresses, though. When taken out of its little spot, it looks like it¡¯s actually smaller than the iPhone 8¡¯s. How could that be, if it has even more capabilities? Turns out this particular logic board is double-sided.Putting a few pieces on the back of a board is nothing new, but this takes it to a different level. It¡¯s really two very thin and very densely packed logic boards, connected with a spacer PCB and with little tunnels through which data can travel.By doing this, the logic board in the iPhone X manages to take up 30 percent less space, while fitting in 35 percent more components. It¡¯s an admirable feat of miniaturization ? but the flip side, so to speak, is that it puts a great deal of electronic eggs in one basket. If something goes wrong with one bit, you¡¯ll have to replace what¡¯s likely the most complex mobile logic board ever made.The good news is that the most common failure of iPhones ? a cracked screen ? is relatively straightforward to fix. That notch holding the Face ID hardware is separate from the screen, so you can replace the glass without replacing the baby Kinect. The battery is likewise relatively easy to replace. Take care of the back panel, though: if it shatters, you¡¯ll pretty much be stuck with it unless you really want to shell out."
182,gadgets,"This is the Xbox One X. It¡¯s the fastest and smallest Xbox and the first to offer games in 4K. At $499 the higher resolution comes at a steep price. After a week with the console and hours of gaming, I can firmly state the Xbox One X is the best Xbox to date. This Xbox has everything.Think about it. The Xbox One X is the culmination of the Xbox project and, right now, at this moment in history, the system is not missing a critical feature or capability. I¡¯m happy to report it performs as advertised, too. It¡¯s fast, smooth and capable of playing games from the past and the present with the best possible graphics.Even though the Xbox One X provides the best possible Xbox experience, it may not be a system for everyone.The Xbox One X is the third version of the third generation of the Xbox. The original came out in 2001 with the Xbox 360 hitting stores in 2005. The current generation started in 2013 with the Xbox One. The Xbox One X shares a lot of similarities with the first Xbox One yet lacks a feature of the original: Kinect. Microsoft once bet the future of the living room on motion and voice controls. Here we are, some four years later, and the Kinect is dead, and the controller stands tall.With certain games, graphics pop and colors shimmer in a way that was not possible on past consoles. The jump in quality is significant with the One X. The increase in quality feels more like the jump from the 480p Xbox to the 720p Xbox 360 rather than the jump from the 360 to 1080p Xbox One.Simply put, gaming at 4K is brilliant. Gaming at 4K with a faster refresh rate is even better, and this Xbox throws down. Games optimized for the higher resolution and quicker refresh rate look better and play smoother. Likewise, games that are not optimized still benefit from the One X¡¯s extra power with faster load times and improved graphics. I guess. Sometimes I felt older Xbox One games were performing better on the One X than the One S but that could have just been because I was using an Xbox that wasn¡¯t pulling from a full hard drive.New games like Gears of War 4 look stunning in 4K and at 60 frames per second. I found the graphics nearly as good as anything available on a PC. Even during the most intense firefights, the gameplay was beautifully smooth. This wasn¡¯t always the case. Sometimes with past systems there was a bit of slowdown when the action sped up. I played latest Gears last month and yet I played through a good chunk again ? for TechCrunch¡¯s readers, of course ? and for the first time in a Gears game, felt like the system had enough headroom to provide the smoothest possible experience.I literally said ¡°wow¡± during the opening fight scene on Gears of War 4. I had played the game since it was released last month, so it felt like the right place to start. The game is already gorgeous, and even on a One S, the gameplay is smooth. However, on the Xbox One X, the gameplay is smoothed out to a silky experience.This is how good Gears of War 4 looks while you¡¯re playing it. Seriously.All the graphical improvements can be complicated.For Gears of War 4, players have several options. In the game¡¯s setting menu, players can select between Visuals or Performance modes. Select Visuals and the game plays in 4k at 30 fps (the pretty mode). The Performance option bumps the framerate to a 60 fps target and keeps the resolution at 1080p (the smooth mode). But this switch is only for the campaign mode. The Horde mode plays at 60 fps in 4k with adaptive resolution scaling to maintain the high frame rate.And these options are the settings for just Gears of War 4. Each game offers different settings and modes and some do not offer any at all.That¡¯s just the start of the confusion. Other games have been updated to support HDR that provides a broader swath of colors and contrast. HDR lets bright parts of the picture look more vivid and dark parts look darker while serving up more colors in between. Only some games output HDR and 4K and some games support HDR or 4K. It¡¯s a confusing mess, and the consumer will suffer.Games like Gears of War 4 were updated to support both 4K and HDR. Others like Halo 5: Guardians or Killer Instinct only support 4K and not HDR. As a consumer, I find the situation insulting and a drawback to buying the console at launch. Eventually, most games will support at least 4K but until then, gamers will need to suffer through Microsoft¡¯s growing pains of convincing developers to release games in 4K.Microsoft is smart to point out that the extra power inside the Xbox One X improves the graphics even on a 1080p display. If patched for the hardware, these games look marginally better on older displays.Sometimes the differences are inconsequential for a person with a 1080p display and a One X. Most users would be hard pressed to notice the difference outside of a few games. On the home screen, the One S performs as well as the One X thanks to the new UI Microsoft rolled out last month.It¡¯s important to note that the Xbox One X does not automatically make a game 4K. And of course the system has to be hooked up to a 4K TV. Moreover, some 4K TVs offer HDR for better color and faster refresh modes for smoother graphics. It gets complicated. There are many variables, and these variables can be expensive.Right now, 4K titles available on disc have to download a patch to output at a higher resolution. There are also 4K titles available through the online Store. In both cases it¡¯s a chore to discover games available at a higher resolution. Right now, at launch, the best place to find 4K games is with this comprehensive list on the Xbox¡¯s site.Users can search for 4K games through the online Store, but some of the results are not 4K games. To check if a game is available in 4K users must click through and consult the Capabilities box on the game¡¯s product page. It¡¯s a tedious process and Microsoft would be smart to add a label to the title¡¯s box art that¡¯s displayed when browsing the catalog.Sony had a similar issue when the PS4 Pro launch, and it seems like Microsoft is handling it slightly better. The online listing is easier to parse and displayed more prominently. When it comes to retail availability right now, it¡¯s just as hard to find a 4K Xbox game as it was a PS4 4K game. Eventually Xbox games will sport a label on the back of the title displaying its graphical capability but the stores I visited are still working through back stock and have yet to get titles with the new labels. I checked two Best Buy Stores and Forza 7 was the only game labeled as 4K capable. The selection will improve over time but it might be hard around the holidays for mom and dad to identify 4K games to buy for your new 4K gaming system.Microsoft proudly proclaims the Xbox One X as the most powerful console ever. And by all accounts, that¡¯s true. It packs more computing power than the PS4 Pro, which until now, held that title.Listen, the Xbox One X is the best Xbox a gamer can buy. Hands down. It¡¯s smoother, quicker and smaller than the Xbox One S. If the One X replaced the One S at the same price, it would be easy to recommend. With the One X priced at $499, for most people, the $279 Xbox One S is the smarter way to spend money. It offers, in most cases, a similar gaming experience and, in a few cases, slightly less pretty graphics ? which you definitely won¡¯t miss if you aren¡¯t running a 4K-capable display, or viewing your set from the proper distance.There is an appeal to gaming in 4K though I question the current value to gaming in 4K. Are the Xbox One X graphics better than on the Xbox One S? Yes, but sometimes the differences are marginal and often meaningless to the gameplay.Purchasing the Xbox One X right now is an investment. 4K TVs are quickly becoming the standard and now that Microsoft and Sony offer 4K systems, eventually developers will start designing games with 4K as the standard. There will be a time when 1080p is an afterthought and that¡¯s when the Xbox One X will be justified. And by then, the Xbox One X¡¯s price will probably be lower and 4K games will be easier to find.When the Xbox 360 came out, it was a runaway hit. The difference between the Xbox and the Xbox 360 are massive. Then the $500 Xbox One came out and the difference was less dramatic over the Xbox 360. The $500 Xbox One X is an even less meaningful jump in quality over its predecessor and gamers will have a hard time justifying purchasing a One X over a One S. To me, it¡¯s not worth it. At least not right now. If you¡¯re the person who needs the best Xbox possible, the One X is the system for you."
183,gadgets,"Nintendo¡¯s having a good year, and it looks like the latest Mario is set to make it even better. Super Mario Odyssey is the fastest-selling Mario ever, in the U.S. at least, breezing past a million sales in under five days here and selling more than 2 million worldwide ? and counting.This should come as no surprise given the Switch¡¯s swift sales and the obvious pent-up demand for a new Mario game. But it¡¯s still nice to celebrate.Reviews, including mine, have been reverent. The game is a joyous gem by nearly every estimation, and its Metacritic score (always to be taken with a grain of salt but a useful metric) is sitting pretty at 97, tied with the incredible Breath of the Wild for the highest-rated Nintendo game in years.I asked Nintendo for a little extra info on the ¡°in the U.S.¡± limitation; could it be that, for example, worldwide first-week sales of (say) Super Mario Galaxy on the Wii were higher? Nintendo declined to add to what it put in its press release, and I don¡¯t blame them. I looked into it for a bit and really, even if that were the case, it would be comparing apples to oranges.The Switch is in a unique position right now and one very different from where the Wii, Wii U or 3DS were in their first year. Mario and Zelda are both must-buys for the system and chances are a huge majority of players will end up buying them sooner or later, much like Ocarina for N64 or Super Mario Bros. 3 for the NES."
184,gadgets,"Elemental Path has come a long way since it debuted its first Cognitoy on the Hardware Battlefield stage at CES?in 2016. The smart toy maker debuted on Kickstarter with an IBM Watson-powered toy dinosaur kids could talk to.It¡¯s now launching a whole new dino robot, the STEMosaur. The new dino looks similar to Elemental¡¯s original smart toy but is now a translucent green and lets kids put it together and program it, too.One other important update ? the STEMosaur eschews Watson in favor of Elemental¡¯s own proprietary software.Why the switch? ¡°Watson is built for enterprise businesses and pharma, not for kids,¡± founder Donald Coolidge told TechCrunch. ¡°Watson helped us to get to market as fast as possible, but we¡¯ve now collected that data and want to use it to build something centering around child interaction.¡±The STEMosaur is currently up for pre-order on Indiegogo, but Coolidge assures us this is not one of those campaigns where the product never ships or you have to wait for three years after buying. In fact, he says the STEMosaur is already in production and will be ready to go this Christmas.Coolidge¡¯s previous dino toy also met with great success, hitting well past its initial Kickstarter campaign by five fold, and he was able to raise around $4 million in funding for it and develop several retail partnerships to sell the toy, including Toys ¡°R¡± Us and Amazon.He hopes to repeat that success with the STEMosaur and intends for the Indiegogo campaign to help build the fan base.It looks like he¡¯s getting what he wanted out of the platform already. There are still 15 days left in the campaign and it¡¯s already blown 200 percent past its original $25,000 goal.Those interested in getting this little dino bot for their kid should keep in mind it is most suitable for those ages seven and up. You can get the basic unit in time for Christmas for $119 for the next few days on Indiegogo, or wait to buy it in stores for $139."

Children who are about to rock, we salute you. The Loog Pro is a guitar made just for kids and features three strings that can be tuned in various open tunings for easy playing. The original Loog guitar was an acoustic marvel, small enough for a toddler but enough versatile for older players. This new Pro model, which costs $199 online, basically cleans up the concept and offers a very playable and light instrument for kids who want to rock out.My kids learned on Loog before they moved to six-string guitars and, like the Populele, the Loog offers easy lessons for beginners. I could also see this as being a hit in schools simply because the guitar is very easy to store and pass out to eager strummers. Each guitar includes a little pack of cards to learn songs and chords and there are plenty of online resources for beginning players.The creator, Rafael Atijas, built the first Loog in 2010 after realizing that kids were so dedicated to electronics that they forgot the musical arts. Now, seven years later, the company is going strong with a full product line of guitars for kids (and adults). Watch below as I shred a little Loog in my sweet home studio."
186,gadgets,"I doubt there has been a time that I¡¯ve scrolled through Facebook and not seen the G-Ro. While this could be part of the magic of retargeting but it could also be fate because the G-Ro has been one of the biggest and most exciting changes in carry-on luggage since the rucksack.The original G-Ro¡¯s claim to fame were its massive wheels designed to lift over curbs and offer a smooth, steady ride. I tried the original bag recently and found it superior to four-wheeled carry-ons I¡¯ve had but a little oddly shaped. With some practice, however, you learn where to put various sundries to ensure proper load balance.The new bags riff on the original¡¯s style and two models, the Check-In and the Office, include a pair of big wheels and a very sturdy and long handle. The other two, the Backpack XV and Backpack Light, take styling and material cues from the original and offer some interesting features of their own.Most important, obviously, is capacity. The Check-In can hold a massive amount of gear including a few pairs of shoes in a separate pocket and a number of pockets designed for easy access to necessary items. All of the bags include a built-in rechargeable battery so you can charge on the go. It costs $299 during the Kickstarter promotion.The Office acts as a laptop case, a document filing system, and even has room for a few overnight things. This one costs $269. The Backpack XV is more like a wearable duffel that can expand and the Backpack Light is a uniquely styled smaller backpack that can hold a 13-inch laptop. They cost $129 and $179 during the Kickstarter promotion.Bags haven¡¯t changed much since the dawn of time: you hollow something out and put stuff into it. I¡¯m pleased to see G-Ro taking things to the next level with a bag that uses carbon fiber, big wheels, and lots of design smarts to keep us rolling through checkpoints with ease."
187,gadgets,"While many were hoping that GoPro¡¯s efforts to turn the company around would continue with its Q3 earnings release today, Wall Street did not like what they saw, sending GoPro¡¯s stock diving 11 percent after-hours.GoPro beat expectations handily on both revenue and earnings per share, but it was the company¡¯s poor forward-looking guidance that led investors to dump the stock in the aftermath of the release. GoPro announced revenue of $330 million on a non-GAAP EPS of $0.15.The action camera company said that it was expecting its fourth quarter (which includes the holiday season) to deliver between $0.37 and $0.47 earnings per share on $470 million in revenue. This didn¡¯t gel well with investors given analyst expectations that the company would be hitting $0.57 on $521.2 million in revenue.¡°During the quarter we generated $47 million in cash and gross margins were 40 percent. Year-over-year, we grew revenue by 37 percent and dramatically reduced operating costs without impacting our product roadmap,¡± GoPro CEO Nick Woodman said in a statement. ¡°We launched our premium-priced HERO6 Black with global on-shelf availability and strong critical acclaim. We are now focused on driving consumer demand to reach our goal of full-year double-digit revenue growth and non-GAAP profitability.¡±The company announced its latest flagship GoPro HERO6 Black at an event in September and will be launching a 360 camera at the end of November. Today, the company also detailed that its Karma drone is the No. 2-selling drone in the U.S. of those priced $1,000 and above.GoPro has had a rough year, but the past couple of quarters have largely painted a more hopeful picture for the camera company. The disconnect with analysts¡¯ expectations for Q4 throws a wrench in that upward momentum despite the company¡¯s Q3 beat."
188,gadgets,"The Google Pixelbook is a bit of an odd duck among notebooks, or among tablets ? or even among notebook/tablet hybrids. It¡¯s a Chromebook, which by now is an established category, though one with very specific appeal; and it runs Android apps, which makes it feel very much like an iPad competitor. It¡¯s a great device in terms of hardware build and general performance, but it¡¯s obviously not going to work for everyone. It is, however, perfect for one use case, and maybe more so than any other gadget that preceded it: Travel.Pixelbook was my companion for a couple recent trips, and it proved more than equal to the task. The form factor in particular is a big boon, since the convertible keyboard that tucks under the display means you can use it during taxi and takeoff without getting any flack from the flight attendants. It¡¯s also great for ensuring a comfortable viewing angle regardless of how little room you have, owing either to just general airline seat design or to front neighbors who insist on reclining even though we all know that the only people who do so are selfish inconsiderate monsters.Using it in ¡°entertainment mode,¡± with the keyboard reversed and the screen coming forward, proves the perfect solution for watching movies on the foldout meal tray, for instance. And the tent mode is also effective for lower viewing angles depending on whether your maybe get bumped into business. It¡¯s also still a relatively compact notebook for use as an actual notebook with keyboard for when you want to get work done while up in the air.The ability to use Android apps provides even more flexibility in terms of travel options, since you can do things like save Netflix shows for offline viewing. One caveat here: I tried to do the same with Amazon Prime Video, and found that playback stuttered in a way that was unacceptable to me, at least. This seems to be one of the bugs that still affect some Android apps when working in Chrome OS, and will hopefully be resolved via future updates on either the Chrome or Prime app side.Pixelbook can also act as a great offline reader, again supported by the Android app library including Kindle, and it¡¯s a terrific virtual notebook or sketchbook if your interests lean that way thanks to the Pixelbook Pen and its terrific, low latency input. Physical controls and USB-C ports make it a bit more flexible than the iPad for doing things like editing photos in the air, and even though its operating system is based around a web browser, there¡¯s actually a lot it can do while offline. The 10 hours or so of battery life that Google claims for the Pixelbook holds especially true when you¡¯re connecting to the web only intermittently or while laying over between flights, too.One other thing makes it a superior notebook either while travelling, or any time: That keyboard. It¡¯s probably the most satisfying keyboard to type on I¡¯ve ever experienced in a notebook computer, with responsive, pleasing tactile key response, but with minimal noise, which is perfect for confined quarters like an airplane cabin (and starkly opposite the effect of the current MacBook Pro means of type input).Ultimately a lot of mobile devices travel well these days, but the Pixelbook just seems particularly well-suited to this task. It¡¯s also impressive how far Chrome OS has come in terms of serving the needs of a greater number of customers ? it¡¯s very close to being the only device I need to get everything done both personally and professionally, and for a lot of people I¡¯m sure it¡¯s already there."
189,gadgets,"The Essential Phone has come a long way since launch in one key area: Photography. When it first hit the market a few months ago, the camera had a nasty tendency to crash and was a bit slow to load and process photos. But Essential has stayed true to its promise of delivering frequent and effective Camera app updates, and the result is a smartphone total package that is easily the best value today at its reduced price of $499 ? and it¡¯s a good contender for best Android smartphone period, now, too, even with the new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL on the market.I¡¯ve been using the Essential Phone throughout its most recent camera updates, and I paid particular attention to the most recent updates for the app which brought a lot of improved stability and improved loading and capture times. Image quality, too, is improved, particularly in low light, which makes it seem like Essential did some work under the hood to improve the sensor fusion work that combines images from its dual color/mono cameras.You can see examples of photos taken from the updated camera app below, including a selection of images taken in Japan. They definitely optimize for different qualities vs. some of the other leading flagship devices out there, including the iPhone X and the Pixel 2, but I¡¯m a fan of the decisions Essential made with regards to their results, including more muted tones and a tendency to avoid exaggerating things like sky colors.It¡¯s a terrific camera for landscapes and street shots, both day and night, and the video camera is also now fast and reliable, though lacking some of the more advanced features of the Pixel 2 like stabilization (but no other smartphone compares to the Pixel in that regard). It also lacks whiz-bang features like a portrait mode for simulating background blur at low apertures, but its mono sensor mode still produces some of my favorite images I¡¯ve ever captured with a mobile device.Camera aside, Essential has also improved general stability a lot, and with its most recent update, introduced the useful fingerprint sensor swipe gesture to bring down the notification tray that¡¯s been staple of the Pixel line from Google.Pairing all the user experience improvements with the stuff Essential got right immediately out of the gate, including its incredible industrial design (which easily tops the Android crop if not the industry, IMO) and its stellar screen (which avoids a lot of the issues inherent in that of the Pixel 2 XL¡¯s pOLED), there¡¯s no question that Essential¡¯s $499 outright offering price is a no brainer.There are other things in the pipeline for the future that could make the Essential Phone stand out even more, including a forthcoming Android Oreo update, and additional modular add-ons made possible via the magnetic accessory port on the back, but even leaving those aside, Essential is the best deal in smartphones right now, and probably the best device period for a large number of people."
190,gadgets,"The?rumors had it right: Sony is rebooting its robot dog, Aibo, announcing a new four-legged companion AI-powered bot incoming with the same brand name but more rounded corners and visible facial features for extra kawaii, including a pair of expressive, puppy-dog eyes.Deep learning tech, fish-eye cameras and a series of other embedded sensors enable Aibo to detect and?analyze sounds and images so that it can learn and respond to its environment and interact with its owner so it appears less, well, robotic.Sony claims Aibo¡¯s adaptive behavior includes being able to actively seek out its owners; detect words of praise; smiles; head and back scratches; petting, and more.Thanks to the embedded cameras you can also instruct Aibo to take a photo for you ? should you want a dog¡¯s eye view of yourself/your home life.¡°Aibo¡¯s AI learns from interactions with its owners and develops a unique personality over time,¡± it writes. ¡°Further, with its owners¡¯ permission, aibo can collect data from these interactions, then connect to the cloud and access the knowledge accumulated from interactions between different owners and their aibo to become even more clever.¡±So, basically, if you¡¯re comfortable installing a roaming camera, microphone and location sensing device in your home that¡¯s designed to watch your every action, listen to what you¡¯re saying and upload all this intel to the cloud to yield new programming instructions so the device changes how it acts around you in a pantomime of intelligence ? this could be the artificial pet for you.Alternatively, you could make like?Sebastian Thrun?and become the proud owner of a real life puppy.But if Aibo¡¯s hairless lines and plastic smells are melting your heart, then prepare to shell out some serious yen:?The Aibo robot itself is priced at?198,000 JPY (~$1,735) but you also need a subscription plan to connect to the cloud service that powers Aibo¡¯s AI.A basic three-year subscription plan costs?2,980 JPY ($26) per month (or ~$790 if you pay up-front for the full three years).It also looks like Sony is limiting Aibo¡¯s release to its home market ? at least for now. It¡¯s accepting pre-orders for Aibo from today, via its website, but won¡¯t be shipping until January according to Reuters.Owners of the pet bot can also access an Aibo store via the companion app to shell out yet more money to buy additional tricks. Add on hardware accessories are also on the slate, such as a toy bone with a ¡°tentative¡± price of ~$26.Sony is also offering a further optional support care plan which gives Aibo owners a 50 per cent discount on repair fees in the event of malfunction or damage, and 50 per cent on ¡°checkups and inspections¡±, for ~$15 per month. (Presumably that¡¯s if you want to pretend you¡¯re taking your pretend pet to the vet.)Aibo¡¯s battery is good for two hours of activity before it¡¯ll need a recharge on its charging mat (taking three hours to be fully juiced).Under its white plastic hood, the bot is powered by a 64bit Quad-Core CPU and is packing LTE and?Wi-Fi:IEEE 802.11b/g/n radios for connectivity.On the moveable parts front, the robopup has 22 degrees of freedom. While its eyes are comprised of two OLED screens, hence enabling new Aibo to have a range of puppy dog looks.The full list of embedded sensors inside the bot are:2 Cameras (Front camera, SLAM camera)
4 Microphones

4 Paw padsThe original Aibo went on sale in 1999, with Sony going on to ship around 150,000 of the robots before production was ceased in 2006.Speaking at a launch event for its rebooted Aibo robopup today, Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai said: ¡°It was a difficult decision to stop the project in 2006, but we continued development in AI and robotics.¡°I asked our engineers a year and a half ago to develop Aibo because I strongly believe robots capable of building loving relationships with people help realize Sony¡¯s mission.¡±"
191,gadgets,"Nearly three years on from Microsoft unveiling its HoloLens augmented reality headsets, the company today?announced?a major expansion of its availability: 29 more markets in Europe, nearly tripling the total number of countries where you can buy the device up to 39.The news shows that while we don¡¯t have a firm number of how many units have been sold, we do know that Microsoft is banking on the device, a non-immersive experience that lets you interact with visual digital images while still being able to see a room as you would normally, as a core piece of its future hardware and software efforts in a bid to compete against the likes of Apple and Google.¡°This is where we believe computing is going,¡± said Lorraine Bardeen, general manager of Microsoft?HoloLens?and Windows experiences, who announced he expansion today at Microsoft¡¯s Future Decoded event in London. ¡°We can bring all your apps and programs right into your world, but you can still see all the things in your world that matter to you.¡±No details so far on when devices in the expanded list will ship, or what local prices will be (we are asking and will update as we learn more). Currently, Microsoft sells a ¡°Development Edition¡± of the device for $3,000 and a ¡°Commercial Suite¡± with added enterprise features for $5,000.The new countries ? Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey ? come one year after Microsoft first took the HoloLens outside of the U.S., when it launched it in?Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. It has since then also expanded it to its first Asian country, Japan. A reported launch in China earlier this year seems not to have materialised yet.There has been some debate about Microsoft¡¯s strategy of being an early mover in AR ? specifically whether banking it primarily around hardware rather than software for readily-available devices (as Apple and Google have done respectively with ARKit and ARCore) has been the wisest move for the company. For now, it seems that it¡¯s the route that Microsoft will continue to take.If the first wave of international rollouts helped Microsoft hit all Europe¡¯s largest markets, today¡¯s news underscores how Microsoft is now entering a wider, scaling phase for its mixed-reality hardware, and points to the company¡¯s intention to keep it at the center of its future hardware plays, particularly as Microsoft continues to push into enterprise tools and services.¡°At Microsoft we are on a mission to empower every person and organization on the planet to achieve more,¡± said Bardeen. ¡°Mixed reality has the potential to help customers and businesses across the globe do things that, until now, have never been possible.?Mixed reality experiences will help businesses and their employees complete crucial tasks faster, safer, more efficiently, and create new ways to connect to customers and partners.¡±The HoloLens is built to run with Windows 10, which natively supports holographic interfaces at the API level. This lets developers program actions through gaze, gesture, voice and ¡°environmental understanding¡± (that is, making sure that an object doesn¡¯t pass through a wall, but bumps against it); and also more easily translate Windows 10 apps into apps that can work on the HoloLens.While the majority of the world has yet to sign on to using and embracing augmented and virtual reality applications, these are important steps in making mixed-reality applications and devices less awkward and part of the more seamless continuum of consumer electronics and computing."
192,gadgets,"New emojis. Do you need to hear anything else? Apple just released an iOS update. iOS 11.1 is the first feature update for iOS 11. It adds a couple of new things, starting with dozens of new emojis.Apple already previewed some of the new emojis, but they are now available to everyone. It includes mythical creatures, such as wizards, fairies, mermaids and vampires. There are some new activities, such as rock climbing and curling.You¡¯ll also find new clothing elements just in time for the winter, such as gloves, scarf and trench coat. There are a handful of new animals and some new facial expressions. Exploding head might be my favorite one.Overall, Apple promises 70 new emojis, which makes iOS compatible with Unicode 10.0. A couple of emojis have also been redesigned, such as the bee one.As always, each emoji character comes in many variations with multiple genders and skin colors when it¡¯s not an animal or an object. And for the first time, some characters are gender neutral.This update alone is a great way to foster adoption rate. Many people install new iOS updates so that they can see and send new emojis. You don¡¯t want to be left behind when it comes to emojis.In other news, Apple is bringing back a tiny feature that many people probably don¡¯t use. You can force-press on the left edge of the screen to dim the current app and launch the app switcher again. The company has also added a new gesture. If you force-press on the left edge and swipe, you¡¯ll go straight to the next app. This gesture is much more efficient than double-pressing on the home button.Finally, iOS 11 comes with a bunch of bug fixes and security updates. In particular, it fixes the KRACK vulnerability. If you¡¯re already running iOS 11, you should update right away as this version should work better than the previous one. Maybe it¡¯ll improve your battery life.Don¡¯t forget to backup your iPhone to iCloud or iTunes before updating. Then head over to the Settings app, tap General and Software Update."
193,gadgets,"Astropad¡¯s forthcoming Luna display adapter and software turns your iPad into a wireless, essentially lag-free monitor for your Mac ? and the company wanted to make it even cooler by including a clever hack that turned the iPad¡¯s mostly useless front-facing camera into a software button. But, unsurprisingly, Apple has nixed the feature by rejecting the update which included the functionality from the App Store.The Camera Button was rejected based on section 2.5.9 of the App Store¡¯s review guidelines, which states that apps which alter the behavior of native hardware or software elements will be rejected. It¡¯s amorphous enough that it could definitely apply if Apple feels inclined, which in this case it obviously does.Still, it¡¯s a bummer, because developers pushing the boundaries of Apple¡¯s available APIs and developer tools is what makes apps, and iOS in general, better. This also looked like a great way to take a tricky UI problem and turn it into an innovative solution.Astropad¡¯s Luna Display was great before the Camera Button ever came along, however, and it¡¯ll remain great after its gone ? still, you gotta feel for the little guy in this scenario."

195,gadgets,"In July?b2b smart access startup Latch announced a partnership with ecommerce platform Jet.com to install 1,000 of its smart locks on residential apartment buildings in New York. It¡¯s now announced the first ¡°secure, unattended deliveries¡± enabled by the installations.Writing in the customary Medium post, co-founder Luke?Schoenfelder says Latch-enabled unattended deliveries kicked off on Monday ? and are currently available for ¡°thousands¡± of New Yorkers (though installations attached to this partnership are still continuing, so it¡¯s not yet completed the full batch).¡°Thousands of people in New York City are able to order anything they want from our partners online and know that they can return home to their packages without the threat of theft, inclement weather, or the dreaded ¡®sorry we missed you¡¯ door tag,¡± says Schoenfelder.¡°While it may seem like a straightforward idea, executing on this user experience has been surprisingly complex. It has taken us just over four years to perfect and actualize this experience for customers, building owners, and partners, including countless hours of product research, hundreds of people, and millions of dollars in development to make this moment possible,¡± he adds.Some of those Latch development dollars have been spent part-funding installations of the smart lock hardware. And it¡¯s clearly hoping the product will get to work marketing the benefits of smart access to convince more building owners to sign up.On the smart lock front, it¡¯s always looked like a challenge for consumer targeting startups in the space to convince masses of individuals to manage the risk and complexity of a smart lock installation in their own home. (See: August Home selling to a veteran lock giant earlier this month, for example.) And indeed, those living in rented accommodation or apartment buildings likely don¡¯t even have the option to swap out traditional locks themselves.Latch¡¯s b2b positioning sidesteps that problem. Though it does mean the company still has the challenge of convincing building owners to upgrade a key piece of infrastructure that they might otherwise be happy to leave unchanged for years.Hence its strategy of part-funding some installations itself to try to get thousands of tenants chattering about the benefits of unattended deliveries ? and generate market pull for smart locks to be installed by landlords. Whether this approach pans out the way they hope remains to be seen as Latch is just kicking things off.¡°This is just the beginning,¡± writes?Schoenfelder, sketching out his wider disruptive hopes. ¡°We believe these new delivery capabilities will create a fundamental shift in consumer shopping behavior, where people increasingly order more and more products to their urban building (and suburban home) without ever going to a store.¡±The startup¡¯s big ambition to shift even more shopping activity online does also carry some risks too though ? as the backlash against the messaging from a startup like Bodega?shows.Add to that,?when your target customers are building owners, chances are they might also be in the business of renting real estate to commercial clients too (who may not be so happy about the prospect of reduced footfall to their bricks-and-mortar stores¡¦ ).How Latch manages to pluck all these variously tensed threads will be interesting to watch. So far the 2014-founded startup hasn¡¯t broken out overall sales metrics for its various smart access products. When/if it does will be key."

Panos Panay, Microsoft¡¯s corporate VP for Windows devices, made the announcement at the company¡¯s Future Decoded event in London.In the announcement, Panay argues that as the global workforce evolves, being a mobile worker will become the new default for many. ¡°The office is no longer restricted to a set of buildings ? it¡¯s at home, in a caf?, a city across the globe, or on a plane,¡± he writes. ¡°With so many changing locations your device becomes your office, and many of our customers tell us that¡¯s what their Surface is to them ? a mobile office.¡±That¡¯s obviously where the Surface Pro with LTE Advanced fits in. Microsoft says the new Pro will feature a Cat 9 modem?and support for 20 cellular bands, so you should be fine in virtually any country in the world (assuming your roaming plan doesn¡¯t bankrupt you when you use your Surface Pro with LTE Advanced to stream Netflix abroad). The promise of LTE Advanced is higher bandwidth and Microsoft promises download speeds of up to 450 Mbps, compared to about 300 Mbps for a standard Cat 6 modem you¡¯d find in other current LTE-enabled devices.All of that connectivity isn¡¯t very useful if your device runs out of battery after half an hour, of course. For the Surface Pro, Microsoft expects 17 hours of video playback time. That doesn¡¯t tell us much about how the device will fare with LTE enabled, but it should still be plenty of time for most use cases.The most basic version of the Surface Pro with these new connectivity options (Intel i5, 4 GB RAM, 128 GB SSD) will set businesses back $1,149 and the one with an i5 processor and double the RAM and SSD storage will cost $1,449."
199,gadgets,"Square is expanding its hardware lineup with a new point-of-sale device called the Square Register.Square¡¯s Head of Hardware Jesse Dorogusker explained that while the company¡¯s existing products incorporate existing hardware (the Square Stand, for example, turns an iPad into a POS stand), the Square Register is ¡°totally integrated ? our hardware, our software, all in the box, all by Square.¡±CEO Jack Dorsey added that the Register is meant to address concerns from larger sellers using Square or considering using it. For one thing, he said some businesses felt the Stand was ¡°very consumer-focused,¡± so they wanted something ¡°more professional.¡±More specifically, Dorsey said the Register solves a big pain point by coming with separate screens for the buyer and seller. The Square team thought it was ¡°clever¡± to design the Stand to swivel back-and-forth (¡°and it is quite clever¡±), but larger sellers wanted separate displays, allowing the customer to see each product as they¡¯re being rung up.The customer display also allows businesses to show off their imagery and branding. It¡¯s detachable to accommodate different countertops. And it supports tap-to-pay, allowing customers to pay with their phone or watch without having to pass it over to the cashier.Other features include Ethernet and offline support, so that businesses without good WiFi (say at a concert venue, or in the basement of a mall) can still use it without worrying about connectivity, and a five-port USB hub, so that the Register can be connected to other devices.This isn¡¯t necessarily going to replace the Stand or Square¡¯s other hardware. Instead, Dorogusker said this gives larger sellers ¡°two great choices,¡± and he added that the real goal is to replace ¡°the giant beige and gray boxes that are out there in the world.¡±As for whether Square is shifting away from supporting smaller businesses, Dorsey said they¡¯ll ¡°always be a part of our growth plan and always who we serve.¡± At the same time, he said the company decided early on that it wasn¡¯t just going to focus on small and independent retailers: ¡°The problem with that is, they want to grow ¡¦ We can¡¯t be a service that says, ¡®Oh, you¡¯re too big for us.'¡±The Square Register will cost $999, plus a transaction fee of 2.5 percent and 10 cents per transaction. Dorogusker acknowledged that might sound a little pricey (¡°You wouldn¡¯t consider $999 an impulse purchase¡±) but he said larger retailers are already spending thousands of dollars on point-of-sale hardware. Plus, the price is lower than buying two comparable iPads. Square is also offering a financing option where businesses pay $49 a month for 24 months.Ben & Jerry¡¯s Ice Cream is already using the Square Register in select locations. And as part of the launch, Square is hosting a pop-up with Top Dawg Entertainment at the Square Showroom in New York City."
