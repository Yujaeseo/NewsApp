0,apps,"Firefox has two new experimental features for you to try out today. One lets you theme your browser with colors of your choosing, the other lets you view two websites within one tab. Both are part of Firefox?ôs Test Pilot program, which allows you to try new features in the form of extensions and help decide whether they?ôll make their way to the public.
Simply called Firefox Color, the first feature allows you to customize various visual elements of the browser, ?úincluding background texture, text, icons, the toolbar and highlights.??There are few presets, or you can make your own.

The changes are applied automatically, so there?ôs no need to restart Firefox just to try out a new look. You can also save and share your creations with others.
The second feature, called Side View, is a bit more unique. Instead of doing the window dance to arrange to websites side by side in separate tabs, you can view different tabs within the same window. It could come in handy if you?ôre doing research or trying to compare prices across different shopping sites, for instance.

Of course, you can already do all those things with side-by-side windows, but Side View could theoretically help you stay a little more organized and prevent the mess of tabs we?ôve all gotten used to. The feature also lets you keep track of recent comparisons so you can quickly access pages you often reference.
You can check out these and other experimental features on Firefox?ôs Test Pilot page.

1,apps,"At its WWDC event yesterday, Apple revealed the major new features coming to iOS 12. If the presentation got you all hot and bothered, you?ôll be happy to know that you can now get your grubby paws on the beta preview.
The official route requires you to be signed up for the Apple Developer Program so you can get it today; the public beta will arrive later this month. If you can?ôt wait, you can try Apple blogger Sam Henri?ôs method.
Naturally, you?ôll want to proceed with caution and back up your data before trying this out. It?ôs also worth noting that the beta can be unstable, is prone to crashing, and doesn?ôt yet include all the features revealed at WWDC.

Still up to the task? Here?ôs how to do it:
You?ôll need to fire up this page (samhenri.com/ios12) in Safari on your iOS device, and then click on the teal colored button labeled ?òDownload iOS 12??at the bottom of the page. That?ôll set you on the path to installing a profile and rebooting your device.
Once you?ôre done with that, you?ôll need to head into Settings to initiate a software update, and when it?ôs finished, you?ôll have iOS 12 running on your iPhone or iPad.
Our own Nino de Vries gave it a go and managed to get iOS 12 up and running on his iPhone X in roughly 10 minutes; hopefully, you?ôll have a similar speedy experience. Here?ôs a list of all the devices that the new version is compatible with:

The latest version of iOS brings a bunch of new features like group FaceTime calls with up to 32 people at once, several customizable Animoji, numerous ways to manage notifications and screen time, sharing suggestions in Photos, and quick actions using voice commands with Siri Shortcuts.
There are even more handy features that you can look for once you?ôve got the update. Let us know your favorites in the comments.

2,apps,"At WWDC 2018, Apple announced it would bring UIKit support to the Mac, making it easier to port iOS apps to a desktop environment.
If that sounds familiar, it?ôs because we?ôve been hearing about it since at least late last year, when a Bloomberg report detailed something called Project Marzipan at the time:
?ú‚Ä¶software developers will be able to design a single application that works with a touchscreen or mouse and trackpad depending on whether it?ôs running on the iPhone and iPad operating system or on Mac hardware, according to people familiar with the matter.??
And that?ôs pretty much what happened, though it?ôll take a while for the full functionality to roll out.
UIKit is the interface framework for iOS apps, whereas Mac apps have traditionally used the aging AppKit. By bringing UIKit support to the Mac ??and it?ôs keyboard+mouse interface ??it makes it easier to port apps from one device to the other
In case you were wondering if this is a sign Apple is planning on combining iOS and macOS, the answer is no. Apple has previously stated that there are no plans to combine the two operating systems, and did so very explicitly during this year?ôs keynote too.
Still, it means that future apps are more likely to show up on both platforms. You?ôre going to have to wait a while though; while Apple is testing UIKit with some of its own macOS apps, third-party devs won?ôt be able to try it until 2019.

"
3,apps,"At Apple?ôs WWDC event in San Jose today, the company announced Mojave, the latest version of its macOS desktop platform with a bunch of updates ??most notably, a new dark mode that spreads across the entire interface.
That includes windows, the dock, and even apps like Xcode.

Finally, Apple.

There are a bunch of new little features that improve usability across macOS. For starters, the Stacks feature quickly cleans up your messy desktop icons.
Next, Finder now has a carousel for you to pick files and preview them easily; the sidebar now displays detailed metadata, and also includes buttons for quick actions like rotating a picture without leaving the window. These buttons are contextual, so they?ôll change depending on what files you?ôre looking at. If you select multiple photos, for example, you?ôll see an action button to create a PDF file with all of them.

Plus, you can customize those buttons to bring up actions you?ôll use often. QuickLook also brings similar action buttons.
The screenshot tool is also getting an upgrade: capturing your screen now brings up a thumbnail which, when clicked, displays an array of tools for editing and marking up your screenshot, like a magnifying loupe. You can also record a video of whatever?ôs on your screen, and then drag that clip straight into a presentation.

There?ôs also a Continuity Camera feature, which lets you invoke your phone?ôs camera from a desktop app that requires an image. Apple demonstrated a document with room for a photograph in macOS, and chose an option from the context menu; it instantly opened the camera app on the iPhone, and retrieved the picture from the mobile device and embedded it in the document. Not bad, but it might have only a small number of use cases.
Apple is also bringing its Home control center to macOS Mojave, so you can view all your IoT gadgets??controls on your desktop, control them with voice commands via Siri, and monitor feeds from connected cameras.

4,apps,"Earlier this year, Google announced a big update to Android?ôs Do Not Disturb mode to help you spend less time distracted by your phone. At WWDC, Apple is making changes to iOS along the same lines.
Perhaps the most notable new feature is the ability to limit how long you use individual apps. Not only can you see the time you?ôve spent on individual apps, but you can set time limits as well.
Say you don?ôt want to spend more than an hour on Instagram per day. Set a limit and Apple will send a full-screen notification when time is up. Better yet, it syncs across your other iOS devices, so you can?ôt cheat that way.

Unfortunately, it doesn?ôt seem you can set a hard limit. As far as we can tell, it?ôs pretty easy to extend your time after you receive the notification to stop there?ôs an ?òignore limit??prompt right on the alert. Still, it?ôs meant to be more of a deterrent than a permanent measure.
Parents will also be happy to know they can apply similar allowances to their kids??devices. Parents can limit how much time their kids spend in some apps, while allowing others ??like educational apps ??to be used unfettered.
It?ôs a small but important update. The average person will spend nearly two hours on social media apps (including YouTube) every day, and that number is expected to increase. Tools like these could help us buck that unfortunate trend.

5,apps,"At Apple?ôs WWDC event in San Jose today, Apple announced that it?ôs finally updated its FaceTime video calling feature to support group calls in iOS 12.
The updated functionality lets you call up to 32 people at a time. FaceTime is also being integrated into iMessage, so you can initiate a call from a text message conversation ??and that includes group calls.

When you ring a bunch of people, they can all drop in and out as they like. When any one person begins speaking, their video window automatically expands to take up more room on your screen; you can also focus on any window by double-tapping it.
FaceTime also supports the new camera effects, stickers and Memoji that Apple is bringing to iOS 12. Ugh.

6,apps,"Apple today announced at its WWDC event in San Jose ?úthis year we?ôre taking Animoji to a whole new level.??First up, it now has ghost, tiger, koala, and T-rex Animojis. But the big deal this year is custom ?úMemojis??that will allow you to create your own personalized Animoji.

Memoji will allow you to choose from a number of options including glasses, hairstyles, hats, and various facial features. The memoji you create is stored with all the other Animoji and can be used live in iOS environments. The new Memoji feature is available now.

And, last but probably also least, Apple also unveiled ?úbreakthrough tongue-detection??technology with the prediction we?ôd all be sticking our tongues out at each other. CEO Tim Cook?ôs tongue, we assume, was firmly in his cheek during the announcement. But the tech is real and your Animojis will now feature animated tongues should you choose to use the new feature.

7,apps,"At Apple?ôs WWDC event in San Jose today, folks from LEGO stopped by to show off how ARKit can enhance play with building blocks using an iOS device, and it looked like a lot of fun.
Essentially, you?ôd simply use LEGO blocks to build out a playset, and then point your iPhone or iPad at it to see contextually relevant 3D objects added to the scene on your screen. It also works with more than one device, so multiple people can see the same augmented reality graphics.

To demonstrate this, LEGO executives pointed their iPads at a building made of blocks; the AR app added animated figures in various rooms, landscape plates and additional buildings, and even vehicles that moved across the screen.
The company promised to bring this and more such AR experiences to iOS.

8,apps,"The opprobrium over Facebook?ôs data privacy practices continues. This time, the New York Times reports Facebook has apparently shared an inappropriate amount of user information with device manufacturers, such as Apple, Samsung, and Amazon.
The details: According to the NYT, Facebook?ôs deals with hardware manufacturers predate the existence of the Facebook app. The company created APIs which would allow companies such as Apple or Blackberry to create Facebook-like features. To allow these features to function, the company agreed to share user data with the companies.
The NYT questions whether these agreements conflict with a 2011 Federal Trade Commission decree that required, among other things, Facebook to, ?úobtain consumers??affirmative express consent before enacting changes that override their privacy preferences.??The APIs provide access to much more information than consumers might be aware of.
As an example, writer Michael LaForgia logged into his Facebook account on a Blackberry Z10. The phone?ôs Hub app retrieved religious, relationship, and political information on all of his 556 friends, and 294,258 of his friends??friends.
The counterargument: Facebook responded to the article directly in a press release. In it, Ime Archibong, the company?ôs VP of product partnerships, argues the two situations are completely different:
Given that these APIs enabled other companies to recreate the Facebook experience, we controlled them tightly from the get-go. These partners signed agreements that prevented people?ôs Facebook information from being used for any other purpose than to recreate Facebook-like experiences. ??This is very different from the public APIs used by third-party developers, like Aleksandr Kogan.
Archibong says the APIs were created to fill a demand for mobile Facebook which the company couldn?ôt fulfill alone, and were thus necessary. He also noted the company is winding down these partnerships in general, having already ended 22 of them.
Why it matters: Had this happened before the Cambridge Analytica scandal, it might not seem quite so shady. If you?ôre using both Facebook and, say, an Apple product, you probably have some inherent trust in both companies ??moreso than I daresay most had in the developer of a Facebook quiz. Archibong also pointed out Facebook?ôs agreements with the companies were designed to prevent misuse, and the company knew of none.
On the other hand, saying ?úWe created these APIs to fill a public need,??isn?ôt exactly refuting the notion that these APIs shared more than the usual amount of private data with companies.
Whether Facebook actually violated the FTC consent decree remains to be seen. The Commission confirmed earlier this year it was conducting a non-public investigation into the company following Cambridge Analytica.

9,apps,"Fortnite, the wildly popular Battle Royale-style game, might make it to the Nintendo Switch at long last.
The news comes from the Korean ratings board, which has classified Fortnite for Nintendo?ôs hybrid console. It also lines up with rumors about the Switch version that mentioned a potential launch at the upcoming E3 expo this month.
The title is already available on Windows, macOS, Xbox, PS4, and iOS. An Android version is slated to arrive this summer.
That should delight fans of the free-to-play co-op survival title, which has garnered legions of followers around the world with its colorful art style and fast-paced gameplay.
It?ôs gained enough traction to encourage publisher Epic Games to offer a $100 million prize pool for its upcoming competition season ??making it the biggest game in esports history.
The company is also embroiled in a legal tussle with PUBG Corp, which operates a rival Battle Royale title called PlayerUnknown?ôs Battlegrounds. That company alleges that Fortnite copied the game mode, and is taking Epic to court for copyright infringement.

The franchise is known for its storytelling, based on historical events, and open-world third-person gameplay in beautifully detailed environments ??so it?ôll be a treat to see what Ubisoft comes up with by drawing inspiration from one of the greatest civilizations of ancient Europe.
Kotaku notes that, according to its sources, there are even more RPG elements than in Assassin?ôs Creed: Origins, like dialogue options.

11,apps,"Google has launched Neighbourly, a mobile app designed to help you learn about your neighborhood by asking other residents. It?ôs a way to find out about local services and facilities in your area from people who live around you.
The beta is presently only available on Android and open to people in the Indian city of Mumbai, it lets you ask questions using text or your voice in English and eight Indian languages. Others can swipe between questions and answer them. Your personal information isn?ôt shared, though people will be able see your profile picture and first name.

That should come in handy for people who live in big cities, or for those who have just moved to a new part of town.
It?ôs interesting to see this push from Google towards creating more avenues and platforms for hyperlocal information. The company already encourages users to review businesses, restaurants, and other establishments in its search engine and Maps service.
It?ôs also worth noting that Google has decided to pilot this app in India, as opposed to its home base in California. In many parts of the US, the Netherlands, and France, people are already used to Nextdoor, a platform to connect people in their own local communities.
Neighbourly isn?ôt Google?ôs first foray into hyperlocal services in India. In April 2017, the company launched Areo, an aggregator for home maintenance, beauty, and food delivery services.
Google is also keen on getting into the burgeoning digital payments space in the country. In September 2017, it launched Tez, an app that runs on India?ôs UPI platform for instant bank transfers, to let people send and receive money, as well as pay utility bills.
If you?ôre in Mumbai and use an Android device, you can try Neighbourly right away by installing the app from Google Play. If your neighborhood isn?ôt listed, you can sign up to be notified when it?ôs added to the service.

12,apps,"Baba Ramdev aka Swami Ramdev may not be a household name around the world, but boy, is he big in India. The 52-year-old yoga guru runs two yoga institutes in India and helped set one up on a private Scottish island, founded a consumer goods company that?ôs now valued at $0.44 billion, and has featured in a reality TV show. His next venture: competing with WhatsApp in India with a rival messaging service.
It?ôs called Kimbho, and it?ôs available for free on Android and iOS. The app lets you text, send ephemeral messages and canned responses, make voice and video calls, and send stickers and doodles.

While Kimbho isn?ôt likely to beat WhatsApp with its feature set, it could garner plenty of users and rival the Facebook-owned service over time.
WhatsApp is believed to have some 200 million users in India, and seems to be the app of choice for most smartphone owners in major cities in the country.
But Ramdev, with his political ambitions, popularity as a yoga practitioner and television personality, nationalist and anti-homosexuality messaging, has the power to influence a growing follower base across the country. His Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter accounts are collectively followed by more than 11.6 million people.
In building a superbrand that sells everything from toothpaste to instant noodles, he has gone up against major companies like Nestle, Colgate-Palmolive, and Unilever; he was also ranked 27th on Fast Company?ôs Most Creative Business People of 2016. A spokesperson for his company, Patanjali, tweeted that WhatsApp now has competition in India.
Kimbho?ôs Google Play listing mentions that the app is completely free, doesn?ôt include ads, and is 100 percent secure. I?ôm not entirely sure I buy that last bit: A French security white-hat hacker who uses the Twitter handle fs0c131y and has previously poked holes in numerous Indian state-sponsored platforms, noted that Kimbho has a bunch of vulnerabilities.
Ok, I will stop here. The #Kimbho #android #app is a security disaster. I can access the messages of all the users??ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏?
??Elliot Alderson (@fs0c131y) May 30, 2018

In addition, the app appears to be a rehash of a previously built messaging service called Bolo. That?ôs from the Facebook and Twitter links on Kimbho?ôs site, which take you to profiles registered in December 2015 for Bolo. The lack of basic hygiene, evidently clear in the poorly built Kimbho website, leads me to believe that the app may have more issues than meet the eye.
This isn?ôt Baba Ramdev?ôs first foray into tech. Earlier this week, his Patanjali brand partnered with government-run telecom service and mobile carrier BSNL to offer a co-branded SIM card for employees of his company and allied organizations. It?ôll be interesting to see if he can use his influence to make a dent in WhatsApp?ôs user base in India.
Update (5PM IST): Kimbho?ôs listings on Google Play and the App Store are both down; it?ôs unclear as to whether the apps were removed by Google and Apple, or whether the company chose to take them down.

13,apps,"Earlier this year, Google released an Android app for drawing in AR called Just a Line. Doodling in AR is fun; you can make things objects float in thin air, like an art class at Hogwarts.
Problem is, when only you can see what you?ôre drawing, you look kind of nutso waving around your phone in the air. And I mean, is your masterpiece even real if now one else is able to appreciate it?

Fret no more. Google now lets you draw with a friend in Just a Line so you can both look wacky gesticulating in mid-air. Simply put the two phones next to each other and tap the partner button. Once connected, your friend will be able to see and join in on your drawing.

Or perhaps you?ôd rather draw with a frenemy; the app has made the jump from Android to iOS today.
Keep in mind the app is pretty barebones; the name ?òJust a Line??is fitting ??and you can?ôt even change colors right now. Still, it?ôs pretty awesome that it works as well as it does using only your phone?ôs plain old camera, and the ability to make drawings with a friend lessens AR and VR?ôs isolation problem.

Hopefully it?ôs only a matter of time before apps like these become as awesomely powerful as Google?ôs own Tilt Brush. Until then, you can download Just a Line from the Google Play Store and Apple?ôs App Store.

The details: Rumor has it that Snapchat is working on a developer kit which would allow third parties to access its signature camera. It?ôs also allegedly working on an option which would let users ?úlog in with Snapchat??to other apps.
Up to now, Snapchat?ôs never opened its userbase to anyone besides Bitmoji. So far, Snapkit?ôs little more than a rumor, so we don?ôt know how much access Snapchat might give to devs. Still, it might breathe a little life back into Snapchat, which has been floundering under the onslaught of Instagram.
But wait, there?ôs more: Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel couldn?ôt resist taking a shot at Facebook, who are known for plundering his app?ôs features for new material. He said at this week?ôs Code Conference:
We?ôd appreciate it if they copied our data protection practices also. It?ôs important to remember that there was no Russian manipulation of data on Snapchat.
?¶no Russian manipulation we know of, Spiegel. But anyway, if Snapchat does open itself up to third-party developers, that sounds like a tacit assurance that Snapchat wouldn?ôt fall victim to the same sorts of pitfalls that led to Facebook?ôs Cambridge Analytica scandal. Given that Snapchat isn?ôt known to collect as much user data as Facebook or the like, it might provide a good alternative for those who don?ôt want to create new login credentials.

But today Google added three more options: The Moto G6, the LG G7 ThinQ and the LG V35 ThinQ. The Moto G6, which I?ôm currently in the process of reviewing, gives users a great budget option, while the G7 and V35 are the first non-Google flagships to grace the service.
It?ôs a good sign. Project Fi, which operates primarily on the T-Mobile and Sprint Networks, offers the most sensible data plan out there, and has some clever techniques to switch between Wi-Fi and LTE. But all that is meaningless if the phones you want aren?ôt actually available.
As great as the Pixel 2 is, the G7 and V35 in particular offer plenty of feature not available on Google?ôs phones, like a super-wide-angle camera and a audiophile-worthy sound chip. And stock Android isn?ôt always the best; I like some of LG?ôs feature?ôs like a one-handed mode and theming engine.
Of course, Project Fi?ôs selection is still much smaller than the big carries, but hopefully this is just a taste of things to come. If Google can manage to get Samsung to sign up, it could force other carriers to step their game up. That said, I wouldn?ôt hold my breath for the iPhone to be officially available on Project Fi anytime soon (although you can kind of get it to work).
For now, the G6 is available to pre-order starting today, and will cost $199 ($50 cheaper than most other places). The G7 will cost $749, while the V35 will cost $899, and will arrive next month. You can head on over to the Project Fi website for more information on the release dates as well as monthly financing prices.

16,apps,"Nintendo Switch fans are in for a treat this November, as two new Pok√©mon titles are set to launch that month, with simplified controls and a mobile tie-in. A third game is on the cards as well.
Pok√©mon: Let?ôs Go, Pikachu! and Pok√©mon: Let?ôs Go, Eevee! are adventure RPGs that will see you take on the role of a trainer and befriend the starter monster of your choice, depending on the title you buy. We heard rumors about the games earlier this month, and it looks like those were right on the money.

You can play the entire game using just a single Joy-Con controller, and have a friend join in for co-op action with the other. The motion controller allows for catching monsters by mimicking the act of tossing a Pok√© Ball at them on screen.
These titles are based on the 1998 release Pok√©mon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition, and are intended to be as accessible as possible to newcomers to the franchise. They play identically, but you?ôll get a different starter monster, and encounter different species in each of them as you progress through the game.
From what we can tell, there?ôs a whole lot of Pok√©mon Go-style monster catching action in store, that will be familiar to players of the mobile AR game. Those folks will also be able to bring monsters they?ôve caught with their phones over to their Switch games.
That?ôs not all: Nintendo will also launch the Pok√© Ball Plus, a controller designed for use with both titles. It?ôs like a basic version of the Joy-Con, but it?ôll also light up and vibrate when you catch a monster with it ??and you?ôll even hear the Pok√©mon cry out from the device. Plus, it?ôll work with select phones running Pok√©mon Go too.

Now, about that third game: The Verge notes that Japanese developer Game Freak also plans to launch a ?òcore??Pok√©mon game in 2019; that hints at an adventure title that will be more true to the franchise?ôs RPG beginnings.
Pok√©mon: Let?ôs Go, Pikachu! and Pok√©mon: Let?ôs Go, Eevee! will go on sale on November 16, along with the Pok√© Ball Plus. If you can?ôt wait until then, there?ôs also Pok√©mon Quest, a free-to-play RPG for the Switch that?ôs available from today and arriving on mobile next month.

18,apps,"Uber today pushed out a special option within its app that allows US users to contact emergency dispatchers immediately, potentially sharing their location as well.
According to The Verge, the ?úpanic button??has been added to the safety center menu on the app?ôs main page, and is labelled: ??11 assistance.??After confirming you intended to do that (presumably to cut down on pocket dials), the app will link you with emergency dispatchers. It was tested earlier in India and is now rolling out in the US.
In some cities, Uber is also testing location-sharing. Dispatchers will receive information on your trip, as well as your driver?ôs car.
Uber?ôs new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, is taking steps to address the company?ôs questionable (shall we say) reputation when it comes to safety. Earlier this year, it came to light women accusing Uber drivers of sexual assault were attempting to free themselves from the company?ôs policy of forced internal arbitration. This month, Uber announced it would no longer hold individual victims to that policy, nor would it require them to keep their silence after the fact.
It also teased the 911 button in the same announcement:
But we didn?ôt stop there: we?ôve added a feature that allows riders to share live trip information with up to five trusted contacts, so there are multiple sets of eyes on each ride. And we?ôre rolling out a new emergency button in the app that can automatically communicate the car?ôs location to a 911 center.
Having the panic button call 911 for you begs the question of why someone wouldn?ôt just call 911 themselves ??and I?ôm sure, for most, that?ôll still be their first instinct. Still, there are a couple of advantages to having the option baked into the app as well.
First, if you?ôre in an Uber, then there?ôs a good chance you?ôve got the app open already. Whenever I?ôve used an Uber, I keep the app open just to make sure the driver is actually heading to the destination (no offense, former drivers). So if for some reason they started heading someplace I didn?ôt ask to go, it?ôd be much more expedient for me to swipe once to get to the option, as opposed to pulling up my keypad and dialing 911 ??and this is a situation where expedience is key.
Second, Uber?ôs ability to track its drivers and riders may prove invaluable for helping dispatchers find you in a crisis. After being taken to task for allowing such extensive data to be used for ill ??it was only recently the company stopped giving drivers a complete record of every passenger?ôs pick-up and drop-off points ??it?ôd be good to see such data put in the hands of those who might use it for positive ends.
And hey, one can never be too cautious.

It?ôs silly, but there?ôs something about hearing a robotic voice exclaim, ?úThese clouds can go fuck themselves,??on a rainy day, that makes you feel like your weather app knows what?ôs up.
There are other little niceties like graphics that change along with the weather, and a simple little game that challenges you to find locations on a world map while poking fun at your lack of intelligence. Ponying up for the premium tier ($3.99 a year) unlocks a home screen widget and access to historical weather data dating back 70 years.
If you?ôre tired of plain vanilla cloud and sun icons in your default weather app, Carrot is worth a look. Grab the beta from Google Play.

21,apps,"Citing ?úbusiness conflicts,??Apple has rejected Valve?ôs Steam Link app from the App Store.
What is it: Steam Link is an app that lets gamers stream PC games to their phones. It?ôs currently available (in beta) on Android. We originally reported that an iOS app was in the works ??and it was ??but now that?ôs not happening. According to reports, Apple blocked the app due to ?úbusiness conflicts with app guidelines.??
While there?ôs been no confirmation, it?ôs likely due to Apple getting a cut of all in-app purchases through its store, and Steam taking a cut of in-app purchases through its store. App Store guidelines don?ôt allow for a store-within-a-store.
The impact: At least six people use iPhones (kidding, it?ôs actually more like 700 million). And none of them have access to the Steam Link app now, which is a shame. Because, as my colleague said, it works like a charm.
In less than five minutes I was able to install the app, access my account, and stream Spec Ops: The Line to my Samsung Galaxy S7 with no problem. The gameplay was smooth, the graphics were perfect, and I look forward to spending more time streaming games to my phone while I?ôm supposed to be working. Unfortunately, iPhone users can?ôt join in my revelry.
According to a report from Reuters, Valve spokesperson Doug Lombardi says:
The team here spent many hours on this project and the approval process, so we?ôre clearly disappointed. But we hope Apple will reconsider in the future.

22,apps,"Acid, a Russian independent game developer that publishes titles on Steam, is set to release Active Shooter, an FPS that simulates a school shooting incident. It allows you to play as the shooter or a SWAT team member tasked with neutralizing the perpetrator.
It?ôs not the first game to attempt to tackle this difficult topic, and yet it?ôs drawn ire from the Steam community, as well as a UK-based nonprofit, and 180,000 people against the title. But they?ôre asking the wrong questions about it.
?úWhy would anybody think it?ôs a good idea to market something violent like that, and be completely insensitive to the deaths of so many children???ponders a spokeswoman for well-meaning London-based charity Infer Trust who spoke to the BBC; the organization also called on Valve to take down the game. A Steam user took to the title?ôs discussion forums to ask the developer, ?úWhy was this even made? What point are you trying to prove???
Violence isn?ôt new to games, or to most media we?ôre exposed to on a daily basis, and we?ôre no longer offended by violent content that we?ôve been hearing about for centuries. Neither are the debates about whether violent games are bad for society.
The truth is, none of this matters. Neither does Infer Trust?ôs point about how ?úThere have been 22 school shootings in the US since the beginning of this year,??because that number is incorrect, and because such incidents aren?ôt new ??there have been countless school shootings in the US dating back to the 1840s.
The real problem with a game like Active Shooter is how it appears to be completely devoid of context ??before, during, and after the fact. Shootings don?ôt occur as randomly and spontaneously as firing up a level in a video game; there are several factors that contribute to these incidents. There?ôs nothing in the description of this ?òSWAT simulator??that might urge players to consider some of the circumstances that lead up to school shootings, like the issues of access to mental healthcare and counseling for adolescents, gun control, and bullying in schools.

There?ôs no mention of moral consequence for the player, regardless of the outcome of their game. Do you ever really ?òwin??in a school shooting? In Acid?ôs title, you?ôre only ever encouraged to ?òprotect and extract or hunt and destroy.??
Similarly, there doesn?ôt seem to be a choice for the player in the shooter?ôs role to rethink their decision to target innocent victims, or to surrender at any point during the attack. Without these options, a game like this will only serve to normalize such violence ??even though the developer says his intention with the title ?òisn?ôt to promote any sort of violence.??
From what we can see, Active Shooter is a SWAT simulator in the basest sense, and is in poor taste given its design (or the lack thereof) and approach to a deeply concerning issue plaguing America. It appears to be an attempt to profit from the tragedies that scores of families face across the country on an all-too-regular basis, and an artless one at that.
It?ôs also, sadly, a missed opportunity to examine the problems in American society that are conducive to such horrific violence, and it?ôs a missed opportunity to encourage gamers to think hard about these issues in ways that haven?ôt yet been explored by news media, authors, and filmmakers.
The real problem with Active Shooter has less to do with what it is, than with what it can be.
Update (May 30, 2018): BBC reports that Valve has removed Active Shooter from Steam.

Subscribers also get access to a bunch more location options, as well as faster speeds and no ads in the app. The service is available worldwide, except for the countries that the US forbids domestic companies to do business with, including Myanmar, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.
In my brief testing in India, I found VPNHub to work as advertised, as it successfully hid my IP and allowed me to access sites blocked in the country without a fuss.

24,apps,"After helping some 40 million users discover billions of pages with interesting stuff from across the web over since the early noughties, StumbleUpon is shuttering its content curation and discovery platform today.
The service was arguably one of the first of its kind when it launched in 2002, providing users with a dead-simple way to find new sites to visit, articles to read, and pictures and video to gawk at. It also happened to arrive at a time when people were graduating from using the internet for essential functions like research and monetary transactions, to killing time and sharing things with friends.
I fondly remember the StumbleUpon browser button: one click, and you were instantly transported to a randomly selected webpage from its vast database, with an almost certain guarantee of spotting something of interest. The company, which was once owned by eBay, gave birth to (and eventually sunsetted) an excellent video discovery tool called 5by, and had once surpassed Facebook as the #1 source of social media traffic in the US back in 2011.
But that was then, and this is now, when ?òrandom??isn?ôt good enough, and even our ?òserendipitous??content discoveries are closely connected to our interests, thanks to cookies that follow us around, platforms that task us with tagging all the things online, and clever algorithms that learn what we?ôre into.
Garrett Camp, the founder of StumbleUpon, wants fans to transition over to his other project, Mix, which he began building back in October 2015, as something like Pinterest for content.

 
It works well enough when you tell the site what you like ??but after spending several minutes on there, I can tell you that it doesn?ôt quite recreate the magic of the SU button.
Farewell, StumbleUpon, and thanks for the hundreds of hours of discovery, and entertainment that was just a click away.
The service?ôs site says that it?ôs moving to Mix.com on June 30, but there?ôs no explanation about whether you?ôll be able to take any of your data with you (though you can create a Mix account with your StumbleUpon credentials).

Steam?ôs Link app for Android, which lets you stream titles to your phone over Wi-Fi, is now available in beta on Google Play ??and I?ôm happy to report that it works as advertised.
As long as your PC and phone are on the same Wi-Fi network, Steam Link will be able to beam games to your device. Naturally, the more powerful your hardware and connection are, the better your experience will be: Valve recommends connecting your PC to the web via an ethernet cable, and ensuring your phone is using your router?ôs 5GHz band if possible.
You?ôll also want to use a Bluetooth controller for the most part: touch input is recognized, but it?ôs not ideal, and most games don?ôt support it for actual gameplay (even if it works in menus and such). To that end, the Steam Controller works pretty well, once you?ôve updated its firmware by plugging it into your PC with a microUSB cable and selecting the option in Steam?ôs settings.

Valve told Variety that its app is capable of streaming games at 4K resolution and 60 fps, if your gaming rig, mobile device, and router are up to the task.

After I followed all the setup instructions in the Steam Link app on my phone, I was good to go. My work laptop isn?ôt great with high-end graphics, so I opted to try a couple of titles that would run smoothly with its configuration: Coffee Crisis, a retro 8-bit style brawler, and Ruiner, a cyberpunk top-down shooter.
Both games ran just as smoothly as they do on my computer, and I didn?ôt notice any drops in framerate, or input lag when using the controller ??even though Steam Link said my phone model hadn?ôt been tested for compatibility, my connection wasn?ôt ideal, and one of the titles wasn?ôt designed for controller input.
However, I couldn?ôt figure out a way to play games that required a mouse and keyboard, like Age of Empires II: HD Edition. The controller?ôs trackpads didn?ôt allow me to move the cursor around, and none of the buttons served as left- or right-click either.
Still, Steam Link is handy for all the times you?ôve wanted to clock some game time, but didn?ôt want to sit in front of your PC. I imagine it?ôll probably allow for a better experience on a tablet with a larger screen than a phone.
I also wonder if game developers can bake in touch support for strategy games and RPGs so they?ôre easier to play without a controller ??it?ôd be a blast to command armies of Incas to slay the invading Conquistadors while lying in bed.
To give it a go yourself, grab the Steam Link app for your Android device from Google Play to get started. An iOS version will soon become available, and work with devices running iOS 10 and newer, as well as Apple TVs running tvOS 10.3 and up.

35,apps,"Fender?ôs $35 Riffstation desktop app, which helps you break down songs to learn its chords and riffs at your own pace, is now available for free on macOS and Windows.
Fire it up, open an MP3 or CD track, and Riffstation will break it down to show you the chords for the entire song. You can also slow the music down or speed it up, transpose its pitch, select a portion of the track to loop and learn, isolate instruments to hear them on their own, play along with a metronome, and view the chord shapes for guitar.

There are other ??and certainly newer ??web and mobile apps that do the same thing, but I find Riffstation especially useful because I?ôm most often playing and learning at my desk. The app worked great on the rock and pop tracks I used it with, naming major and minor chords correctly almost all the time.
However, it occasionally got a couple of them wrong; it also doesn?ôt display complex voicings, like 7ths and diminished variants.
That being said, it?ôs perhaps better to use this for learning songs than following guitar tablature note-for-note: you?ôre forced to really listen to the song and figure out the nuances on your own, and that helps develop your skills as a musician.
The Riff Builder tool is pretty interesting on its own: you can use it to select portions of a song to loop ??whether that?ôs to slow it down so you can learn it easily, or to create a spot that you can solo over endlessly, or to create an entirely new song just for kicks. It does take a bit of getting used to, though, so I?ôd recommend familiarizing yourself with the instructions on this page before trying it out.
As you?ôve probably surmised by now, you don?ôt need to play guitar to get some use out of this app. The chord analysis should be equally helpful for pianists and bassists, and the Riff Builder will come in handy for anyone who wants to fiddle with their favorite tracks and experiment with new ideas on them.
Fender, which acquired the Irish startup that made Riffstation back in 2015, didn?ôt specify why its web-based service for learning songs was being deprecated ??but it?ôs likely got something to do with music licensing issues. We?ôve contacted the company to learn what?ôs up. In the meantime, you can enjoy this handy app for getting to grips with the songs you hold dear in your offline music collection.

According to a report from TechCrunch, Facebook is adding several new features to its ?úStories.??Specifically, it?ôs adding an archive for Stories posts, so you can save the ones you like to a permanent gallery.
That, in and of itself, wouldn?ôt be exciting: both Snapchat and Instagram already offer options for saving Stories so they won?ôt disappear. The difference between their archives and Facebook?ôs is the latter automatically saves your Stories, so you?ôll never lose pics you wanted to save.
The archive becomes more interesting when you pair it with the second feature: cloud storage.

If you?ôre like me and forget in the moment to edit/filter/jazz up your photos, you can now save the fuss for later. Facebook?ôs director of Stories Connor Hayes told TechCrunch:
Saving photos and videos can be used to save what you might want to post later ??So you don?ôt have to edit or post them while you?ôre out with your friends, and instead enjoy the moment at the concert and share them later.
If you use both features in tandem, you can take pictures of your exciting life events, save them in Facebook?ôs archives until you have a quiet moment to post them, and then save them into a permanent archive. Not only does it virtually eliminate the ephemerality that has characterized Stories up to this point, but it incorporates it more closely with Facebook?ôs existing uses.
It?ôs not exactly a trade secret that the best things about both Facebook?ôs and Instagram?ôs Stories were copied from Snapchat. And while Instagram?ôs Stories are now more popular than Snapchat?ôs, neither has really transcended the basic concept which earned the original so much acclaim. While Snapchat wallows in an inadequate (and partially rolled-back) redesign, Facebook is sculpting its Stories into something else.
Ephemeral pictures work for a more visually-oriented site like Instagram, but they?ôre not as important to the massive life chronicle that is Facebook. It?ôs like going to Walmart and getting a root canal ??I?ôm sure it?ôs offered there because everything is offered there, but surely there are better places to be doing this?
But free (and apparently unlimited) photo storage and automatic archiving bridge the gap between ephemeral sharing and Facebook?ôs more typical posts. To put it simply, it?ôs more useful to Facebook users than just copy-pasting the mechanics of Instagram.
Almost as an afterthought, Facebook is also adding voice posts, which allows the camera-shy to make fun updates without having to put on makeup first. We asked Facebook if voice posts were coming to Instagram ??they?ôd fit in nicely with the text updates feature. Facebook declined to comment.
Archives, camera storage, and voice posts are rolling out first to Indian users, then to the rest of the world shortly after.

XD previously cost a minimum of $10 a month for access to the app?ôs macOS and Windows software, as well as its mobile preview tools for Android and iOS; that plan also netted you 100GB of cloud storage and unlimited shared prototypes and design specs.

The free starter plan lets you get started with 2GB of space and a single active shared prototype and design spec; you?ôre also limited to using a limited font set from Typekit, as opposed to the complete library available to those on paid plans.
Still, the offer is nothing to sneeze at: offerings from rivals will set you back by a bit more. Sketch costs $99 a year and is only available for macOS. However, you could also consider Invision Studio, which comes with Invision?ôs prototyping service, and is available to users of its free tier.
In addition to the new plan, XD is also getting a bunch of upgrades this year, including the ability to replace all instances of custom design elements (called ?òsymbols?? across your apps at once, and paste an object to multiple artboards with a single action.
The app also opens Photoshop files quicker and preserves image effects, makes it easier to view multiple pages from Sketch files, and lets you password-protect your design specs.
Adobe says that it has big plans for new XD features in the coming months, including advanced prototyping and animation capabilities, new team collaboration features, and plugin support.
With that, Adobe is set to attract a wider set of budding user interface and experience designers than its competition; it?ôll be interesting to see if this prompts those rivals to respond with more accessible offerings in the future.

40,apps,"Facebook today published its annual transparency report, and for the first time included the number of items removed in each category that violated its content standards. While the company seems to be very proficient at removing nudity and terrorist propaganda, it?ôs lagging behind when it comes to hate speech.
Of the six categories mentioned in the report, the number of hate speech posts Facebook?ôs algorithms caught before users reported them was the lowest:
For hate speech, our technology still doesn?ôt work that well and so it needs to be checked by our review teams. We removed 2.5 million pieces of hate speech in Q1 2018 ??38 percent of which was flagged by our technology.
Compare that percentage with the number of posts proactively purged for violent content (86 percent), nudity and sexual content (96 percent), and spam (nearly 100 percent).
But that?ôs not to say the relatively low number is due to an defect from Facebook. The problem with trying to proactively scour Facebook for hate speech is that the company?ôs AI can only understand so much at the moment. How do you get an AI to understand the nuances of offensive and derogatory language when many humans struggle with the concept?
Guy Rosen, Facebook?ôs Vice President of Product Management, pointed out the difficulties of determining context:
It?ôs partly that technology like artificial intelligence, while promising, is still years away from being effective for most bad content because context is so important. For example, artificial intelligence isn?ôt good enough yet to determine whether someone is pushing hate or describing something that happened to them so they can raise awareness of the issue.
If a Facebook user makes a post speaking about their experience being called a slur in public, using the word in order to make a greater impact, does their post constitute hate speech? Even we were all to agree that it doesn?ôt, how does one get an AI to understand the nuance? And what about words which are offensive in some language, but not another? Or homographs? Or, or, or ??the caveats go on and on.
When it?ôs being asked to read that kind of subtlety, it shouldn?ôt be a surprise Facebook?ôs AI has only thus far had a success rate of 38 percent.
Facebook is attempting to keep false positives to a minimum by having each case reviewed by moderators. The company addressed the issue during its F8 conference:
Understanding the context of speech often requires human eyes ??is something hateful, or is it being shared to condemn hate speech or raise awareness about it? ??Our teams then review the content so what?ôs OK stays up, for example someone describing hate they encountered to raise awareness of the problem.
Mark Zuckerberg waxed poetic during his Congressional testimony about Facebook?ôs plans to use AI to wipe hate speech off its platform:
I am optimistic that over a five-to-10-year period we will have AI tools that can get into some of the linguistic nuances of different types of content to be more accurate.
With that estimate, it?ôd be absurd to expect the technology to be as accurate as Zuckerberg hopes it?ôd be now. We?ôll have to check Facebook?ôs transparency report in the next couple of years to see how the company?ôs progressing.

41,apps,"Twitter is changing up its policies with regards to nasty tweets ??not by banning them or the users who created them, but by hiding them from view.
According to VP of Trust and Safety Del Harvey, and Director of Product David Gasca, Twitter has identified so-called troll behavior as such:
What we?ôre talking about today are troll-like behaviors that distort and detract from the public conversation on Twitter, particularly in communal areas like conversations and search. Some of these accounts and Tweets violate our policies, and, in those cases, we take action on them. Others don?ôt but are behaving in ways that distort the conversation.
In order to identify the behavior, the company has picked out certain patterns of behavior which it associates with troll-like accounts. For example, a user who signs up for multiple accounts at once, or users who repeatedly tag those who don?ôt follow them in tweets.
According to Twitter?ôs Safety account, these ?úsignals??can be identified by an algorithm, and are tied to behavior, not the content of the tweets themselves. This would seem an attempt to shield the company from accusations of silencing anyone of a particular political persuasion.
Today we are introducing new behavior-based signals into how Tweets are organized and presented in areas like conversations and search. 
This is to improve the health of the conversation and improve everyone?ôs Twitter experience.
??Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) May 15, 2018

When it?ôs identified troll-like behavior, Twitter will place the user in a sort of quarantine. Any of their interactions will be invisible to users unless they press the ?úshow more replies??button under a tweet.
Note this doesn?ôt actually mean any content is removed. The problematic content is just hidden. If this sounds familiar, it?ôs very similar to a tactic called ?úshadowbanning,??a practice that Twitter has already been accused of using in the past.
Gasca and Harvey don?ôt say whether the proclaimed troll tweets would be demoted for everyone, or just for specific users they?ôve been known to target. Either one would have its pros and its cons.
Still, Twitter?ôs discourse is often colored by such tweets, and banning the people involved seems like a good way to open the platform to cries of censorship (well, more open than it is already). This is an efficient compromise, though the effectiveness of the algorithm in detecting trolls would have to be demonstrated first.

Thankfully, that?ôs all of us: a quick survey in the TNW newsroom revealed all manner of unnecessary viewing, like this ancient Vine, this way-too-slick clip of beetleweight fighting robots, this primate peeing into its own mouth, and this dude delivering the most profound monologue ever while enjoying an LSD trip in the Thar desert.

It works by suggesting words and phrases that it can autocomplete for you as you type (just hit Tab to accept each suggestion), and it works for new messages as well as replies.

Smart Compose works well enough, but it?ôs not exactly revolutionary. In my testing, I found it to correctly suggest phrases to complete sentences and questions like, ?òWill my parcel arrive today or tomorrow??? and ?òPlease let me know.??

Up until now, Google Drive represented your available storage across your Google account, including Photos, Gmail, and whathaveyou. Google gives you 15GB of storage for free, but if you want more space, you have to pay up. Current Google Drive plans are as follows:
Now those paid storage plans are covered under a new ?òGoogle One??moniker, with more flexible pricing. The $9.99 option ??the most popular plan ??will now net you 2 TB of storage. Meanwhile, Google is also adding a $2.99 plan that gives you 200 GB of storage, which might be a solid option for people who are simply running out of space but don?ôt feel like shelling out $120 a year.
The new plans  give users more options for every budget, but you?ôre also getting more for your money. The company says Google One will give you ?úone-tap access??to customer service, as well as deals on hotels and credits on Google Play. You?ôll also be able to share the plan with up five family members.

49,apps,"Google announced this week it?ôs overhauling Maps with multiple new features intended to turn the app into a one-stop shop for planning a night out. In borrowing features from apps like Yelp or Foursquare, Maps shows the potential to surpass both of them.
For starters, Google is redoing the Explore tab. Currently, it?ôll show you a listing of local businesses and some restaurant ideas based on the time of day. With this update you?ôll see a list of trending topics related to the area you?ôre in, including a top ten list of restaurants. Again, Yelp and Foursquare ??all the features look very familiar so far.
One new feature which sets Maps apart from the likes of Yelp is matching. Using data on where you?ôve gone in the past, your Google reviews, and all of the info Google has about a location, Maps will give you a match percentage. It amounts to a guess as to how likely you are to enjoy a restaurant ??sort of like OkCupid, only it?ôs matchmaking your stomach.
Finally, Google?ôs putting in new options for group planning. If you and a bunch of friends want to go out, but aren?ôt sure where, you can put together a short list in Maps. The list is shareable, meaning the other group members can contribute to it, and everyone can vote on the place they?ôd most like to go.
If nothing else, it democratizes the question, ?úI don?ôt know ??where do you wanna eat???
Any one of those features would be enough to raise Google Maps??profile to the level of other dining apps. Taken together, they elevate Maps to something more than any app I?ôve yet found.
If you?ôre already using Google Maps to navigate to restaurants or activities you?ôve found via other apps, then this cuts out the middle man. It remains to be seen if it has the same community engagement that drives the feedback on Yelp, or the ubiquity of Foursquare.

The bigger of the two apps, Steam Link, would allow users to stream games from their PC or Mac to devices ranging from phones and tablets to Apple TVs. They could be controlled with either Steam controllers or MFi controllers, with the company implying more forms of control would also be available.
That?ôs not to say there aren?ôt caveats. For starters, you won?ôt be able to stream games to your phone from just anywhere. To use Link, you?ôd need to connect your device to your host system either through a 5Ghz Wi-Fi network or through an Ethernet cable.

Also, the company hasn?ôt said what other kinds of controllers will be available for Link players ??touch control would be almost required for phone streaming, I?ôd think.

According to the App Store Review Guidelines, the specific rules these apps are allegedly violating read as follows:
Apps that collect user or usage data must have a privacy policy and secure user consent for the collection. . . You may not use or transmit someone?ôs personal data without first obtaining their permission and providing access to information about how and where the data will be used.
So, beyond simply asking for user permission, Apple wants to make sure app developers inform users what their information is being used for.
The move comes in conjunction with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) laws, which become enforceable later this month. Apple has already revamped its privacy controls in preparation for the new laws ??Bloomberg reported the company would roll out a site allowing users to download all of their information and to delete their account if they choose to.
While the move does dovetail with the new GDPR mandates, it also reflects the moves Facebook has taken to help protect its users??privacy in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The language in the Guidelines also specifies developers:
??may not attempt, facilitate, or encourage others to identify anonymous users or reconstruct user profiles based on data collected from depth and/or facial mapping tools ??or data that you say has been collected in an ?úanonymized,???úaggregated,??or otherwise non-identifiable way.
The language recalls concerns that Facebook collects data and builds profiles of non-users ??concerns which Mark Zuckerberg vindicated when he confirmed Facebook did as much during his Senate hearing last month.
Apple may not be under the same criticism as the embattled social network ??in fact, Tim Cook is on the record saying his company wouldn?ôt commit the same sort of errors due to not having the same revenue model.

It can recognize things like printed text, signage, people, and objects like chairs and tables, and notify you of their locations with audio cues like ?òcouch at 3 o?ôclock.??

That should help people with vision problems move around more independently. Google says the app will work offline, and support four different modes to deliver relevant information, depending on what you?ôre doing:
If you?ôre getting ready to do your daily chores you?ôd select ?úHome??and you?ôll hear notifications that tell you where the couch, table or dishwasher is. It gives you an idea of where those objects are in relation to you, for example ?úcouch 3 o?ôclock??means the couch is on your right. If you select ?úWork & Play??when heading into the office, it may tell you when you?ôre next to an elevator, or stairwell.
The fourth mode, Experimental, is meant for testing out Lookout features that are still in development.

The app sounds similar to Microsoft?ôs Seeing AI, which was launched on iOS last year and works as a ?òtalking camera,??audibly describing things around the user as they point their camera at people and objects. However, Lookout seems like it could be more useful as its various modes can help highlight only the important objects in one?ôs surroundings based on what they?ôre doing ??and therefore cut out a whole lot of noise from the app.
Lookout might work well in conjunction with something like Microsoft?ôs other app, SoundScape. It helps people get around and become aware of exactly where they are, by pairing with a stereo headset and calling out the names of roads and landmarks that they pass by.
The app will become available to Android users in the users later this year.

56,apps,"The latest version of the Firefox web browser is out. Despite Firefox 60 being a perfectly round number, this isn?ôt really a milestone release, especially compared to Firefox Quantum which dropped a few months back. Still, there?ôs some nuggets worth getting excited about.
Perhaps the biggest feature dropping in Firefox 60 is support for the WebAuthn standard, which allows you to authenticate against online services using a hardware token, like the ubiquitous Yubikey.
Firefox is (at the time of writing) the only browser to actually support WebAuthn, which means support for the standard is fairly limited across the web. Regardless, it?ôs an exciting peek into where things are going. Here?ôs how Mozilla described it in its blog post:
Essentially, WebAuthn is a set of anti-phishing rules that uses a sophisticated level of authenticators and cryptography to protect user accounts. It supports various authenticators, such as physical security keys today, and in the future mobile phones, or biometric mechanisms such as face recognition or fingerprints. When your YubiKey is plugged in, the website will read it and automatically log you into your accounts.
Given the security deficiencies of password-based authentication, and the inherent issues within SMS-based two-factor authentication, I?ôm glad that Mozilla is throwing this much effort into bringing WebAuthn to its audience.
Put simply, hardware token-based authentication is best. It?ôs the most secure. But the success of this isn?ôt really something Mozilla has any control over, and largely depends on how it?ôs adopted by consumers and websites alike.
One of the most exciting features in Firefox Quantum is Stylo: a brand new CSS rendering agent written in Mozilla?ôs Rust programming language.
Even if you?ôre not a programmer, there?ôs plenty to get excited about with Stylo. It?ôs built with parallelism in mind, and unlike other rendering agents, is able to split its work across multiple processing cores.
On the desktop version of Firefox, Stylo has brough some impressive performance gains. It?ôll be interesting to see how this works on the mobile version, especially when you consider that many contemporary smartphones and tablets have eight, ten, or even twelve processor cores.
Mozilla also said it?ôs going to start using Stylo to render UI elements on the desktop version of Firefox. It?ôs not clear how great a performance boost that?ôll offer though.
One feature introduced in Firefox Quantum is called ?úThe New Tab Experience.??
Let?ôs ignore the fact that this sounds like an acid funk band from the 1970?ôs (it does). Essentially, this is where Mozilla recommends relevant content from Pocket (which it acquired in February of last year), and shows you the sites and pages you?ôve visited recently.
New Tabs got a bit of love from Mozilla in Firefox 60. ?úTop Sites,??which are what they sound like, are more prominent. The number listed has increased from six to eight.
Controversially, users in the US may encounter sponsored content from Pocket. This isn?ôt likely to be popular (advertising never is) but Mozilla is emphatic that this process happens without sacrificing user privacy. In its blog post, it said:
As part of our exploration into new models that can support high quality content on the web, users in the US may now see an occasional sponsored story within Pocket?ôs recommendation section on New Tab. It?ôs part of our focus to deliver personalization, without sacrificing user privacy. What?ôs unique is that all the recommendations happen on your computer, meaning neither Mozilla, Pocket, nor sponsors receive a copy of your browsing history.
To Mozilla?ôs credit, this is pretty easy to turn off. Just click the cogwheel icon on the New Tap page, and uncheck ?úshow sponsored stories.??
Mozilla has been aggressively targeting the enterprise world of late, in a desperate attempt to claim this turf from Microsoft and Google. Not too long ago, it released a beta business-oriented version of Firefox Quantum.
This effort is taking a clearer shape in Firefox 60. Mozilla is eager to tout its administrative controls, and how it can be customized via Windows Group Policy, or by manually editing a JSON file.

The company has also highlighted two new ?ústreams??of its business version. The standard Rapid Release (RR) gets feature updates at the same pace of the consumer version, while the Extended Support Release (ESR) is essentially Firefox?ôs Long Term Support (LTS) product.
The ESR gets feature updates once every year, although Mozilla pointed out that both versions will get security updates as they are released. The purpose of the ESR is ostensibly to offer stability to businesses who typically take longer to respond to change.
I?ôm pretty evangelistic about Firefox, and for good reason too. In addition to being one of the fastest browsers around, it?ôs arguably one of the most forward-thinking.
If you want to check out Firefox 60, it?ôs available from today. You can grab it on Windows, macOS, and Linux here. On Android, you can grab it from the Play Store.

57,apps,"Just as rumored, Android P will officially bring gestures to Team Google, replacing the classic trio of buttons at the bottom of your screen with finger dances reminiscent of the iPhone X (or the Palm Pre, anyone?). The new interface centers around a single pill-shaped home button, which allows you to access a redesigned multi-tasking interface. Here?ôs how it all works.
First things first: right now, the gestures are optional. In fact, when I installed the beta build on my Pixel 2 XL, the feature was turned off. It?ôs possible that it?ôs the default on a fresh installation ??I installed Android P as an update ??but if you?ôre running the beta and don?ôt see the new interface, you can toggle it in Settings> System> Gestures> Swipe up on home screen.

Swipe up from the bottom of your screen, and you?ôre greeted with your recent apps in new hub called the ?òOverview?? Unlike the old Recents screen, Google will also suggest some apps you might want to launch at the bottom of the display, as well as a search bar to quickly look up information.
If you swipe up once more, you?ôll get a full view of your app drawer. That essentially replaces the need to use your launcher to open new apps, as you can simply access you launcher from anywhere now. Meanwhile dragging the home button right lets you quickly scroll through your recent apps in horizontal card view (it doesn?ôt work if you drag to the left). A fast swipe to the right functions like Alt+Tab on Windows, switching to the previous app. Just tapping on the button still goes home, and holding it still invokes the Assistant.

There?ôs a clear emphasis on multi-tasking with the new gestures. On that front, there?ôs a neat trick with the new cards: because of the larger previews, you can now select text right from from the Overview. That means you copy text between apps more quickly, handy for things like pasting a friend?ôs address into Google Maps. Selections also work with Google?ôs Smart Actions allowing you to select the name of a song and immediately play it in Spotify, for instance.
But what about the back button? Google has opted to make that most classic of Android buttons a little more contextual; basically, it hides from view when you don?ôt need it, such as on your home screen. I think the change is a little considering the back button is used all the time in Android, but it shouldn?ôt affect functionality.

On a related note, the extra space at the bottom does free up your phone for some new features. For instance, if you have rotation lock turned on, you?ôll be able to unlock it from a contextual button that will show up when you turn the device. I imagine Google is thinking up other ways to use the bottom of the phone now that it has the real estate; I wouldn?ôt be surprised to see more contextual buttons show up in future updates to Android.

Keep in mind this update is just for phones running Google?ôs UI. It doesn?ôt seem manufacturers will be required to adopt Google?ôs gestures, and many Android OEMs like Huawei and Motorola already include gestures of their own. Nonetheless, expect gestures to become a lot more prominent in Android devices to come; I?ôve only been using them for about an hour, but despite some small complaints, it?ôs a welcome improvement.

58,apps,"If you think about it, using a PC is kind of like working in two operating systems: Windows and your browser. I can have have five apps running in my taskbar, but then another ten web apps and sites in my browser. So things can get pretty messy.
That will someday be a thing of the past. At today?ôs Build conference keynote, Microsoft announced that in ?úthe next Insider build,????Microsoft?ôs beta program for Windows ??you?ôll see the tabs you were working on within Edge when you press Alt+Tab. It?ôs about time.
It?ôs part of Microsoft?ôs Sets feature. If you don?ôt recall, Sets is Microsoft?ôs way of adding tabs to full-fledged Windows apps; the idea is that you can group together different apps for a single project the way you group tabs in your browser windows. But that convenience is dampened when pressing Alt-Tab doesn?ôt get you straight to the browser tab you want ??you need to first open your browser and then find what you?ôre looking for.
That said, its not totally clear if this only applies to the browser tabs within a specific Set, or if it includes all your Edge tabs. The latter could quickly become messy for those who keep 10+ tabs at a time, so hopefully there?ôs a way to turn it off too.
Of course, the problem for many will be that ?òEdge??part. It?ôs not exactly everyone?ôs favorite browser, but in theory other apps should be able to do so by sending your data to the Microsoft Graph. Whether that happens is another matter entirely, but for now, it gives Edge a real convenience advantage.

59,apps,"Automatic brightness is useful, but it also kind of sucks. Some people, like me, prefer their screen at eye-searing brightness. Others like to keep it as dim as possible while still being legible. Still more prefer it somewhere in between.
All this means that you?ôre probably constantly fiddling with the brightness of your phone because it can never guess how you like your screen. With Android P, that vexation could be a thing of of the past. Google is introducing a new version of Adaptive Brightness that learns from your brightness habits.
Currently, most Android phones use a form of adaptive brightness that simply operates within a limited brightness range. When you move the slider, Google still adjusts brightness automatically, but theoretically keeps it within a comfortable range based on where you left the slider. This is better than the simpler automatic brightness, which adjusts light levels based on ambient settings with no user input.
The newfangled adaptive brightness will take note of how you tend to change your brightness levels throughout the day so that you don?ôt have to do so that often. Google says it?ôs been effective among test users: almost half of them make fewer manual adjustments throughout the day. That said, it?ôs not clear if that will also take account of how you change brightness in different apps. For example, I tend to keep my screen dimmer when using the Kindle app, for instance, but brighter when watching Netflix.
Regardless, it?ôs a change for the better. As someone who fiddles with brightness at least a dozen times a day, I still hold out hope that someday I won?ôt have to.

To be clear, Android P already had a developer preview that was a bit of a hassle to install and didn?ôt include many new features. This beta includes a litany of updates, including new gesture-based controls, improved volume settings, smarter automatic brightness, AI-powered battery improvements and more.
Another bit of good news: for the first time, the beta won?ôt be limited to Google?ôs own devices. The company announced Android P would be available for testing on flagships from seven other companies ??OnePlus, Essential, Vivo, Nokia, Sony, Oppo, and Xiaomi ??most of them as soon as today. So far these are the compatible models:
All of these phones can download and flash the beta right now, though be sure to read the fine print before installing. Most of the devices can?ôt download the beta via an over-the-air update, for example. You may have to wipe your device and flashing the Android P image manually. And as always, expect bugs to be present. Proceed at your own risk.
OnePlus, on the other hand, is a bit of a special case. The Android P beta will launch with the OnePlus 6 on May 16. It doesn?ôt seem the beta will arrive on earlier devices, as the company says ?úOnePlus 5/5T friends, we?ôll have something nice lined up for you later this year??in a forum post.
Keep in mind it appears these devices will be running a stock Android build, likely with few additional features ??although some phones seem to at least be sporting their custom camera apps in preview images. Regardless, it?ôs a huge news for Android aficionados. After all, not all Android fans own a Pixel. ?úTogether, not the same,??as Google?ôs marketing goes.

61,apps,"Being a researcher at China?ôs largest missile-maker sounds great. Rather than working on some terrifying new weapon, they?ôve only gone and designed a meat sniffer.
Reported by China Daily, researchers at China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp (CASIC for short) have developed a nifty little gadget that lets individuals check the freshness of flesh.
?úYou open the device and an application on your mobile phone and then place the device very close to the meat for about 10 seconds,??Niu Ye, an engineer at the institute working on the product, told the China Daily.
Users should have no issues with this, as it sounds very similar to how lots of men use Snapchat and smartphones in general.
The meat sniffer ??which can be used with almost every kind of animal tissue ??works by detecting and measuring the bacteriological activity, doing so by analyzing the levels of ammonia and volatile organic compounds in the muscle mound. It then judges the meat?ôs freshness and displays this on the phone screen for the user to marvel over.
There?ôs an issue at the moment though: it?ôs only 80 to 90 percent accurate. This means that you have a 10 to 20 percent chance of having some long conversations with the toilet after using it. Still, Niu Ye says this will be improved in future versions of the hardware and app.
CASIC has big plans for the meat sniffer, with it looking towards mass-production. It?ôs the first device of its kind developed by Chinese engineers, although other products that do the same thing ??like My Food Sniffer ??already exist elsewhere in the world.
The nature of the China means that when the meat sniffer does go live, it will have access to a huge market that has less stringent food safety laws than Europe or the US, as well as a large rural population. This gives the product a greater relevance to the Chinese people than it would do in other parts of the world, so I doubt it will really take off in the EU.
So, would I let this gadget sniff my meat? I mean, I guess so, I just wouldn?ôt pay for the privilege.

Now, TechCrunch reports that a fix might be on its way: a peek into an installer for Twitter?ôs Android app revealed a ?òSecret conversation??feature with encryption keys ??indicating that the company might be planning to launch encrypted DMs soon. Its spokesperson has declined to comment, so we don?ôt yet know whether the feature is presently being tested with some users, and when it?ôll launch globally.

Whether you?ôre a whistleblower, a citizen journalist with sensitive information, or just someone who values their privacy when messaging folks on Twitter, it?ôd certainly be nice to see the platform updated with this feature.

If you?ôve used a recently made Dell machine, like the 2018 XPS 13 we reviewed in March, you?ôll find the functionality to be rather similar to the company?ôs Mobile Connect software.

66,apps,"It?ôs hard to believe Reddit is over ten years old, but the design does admittedly show its age. So the site?ôs designers are working to bring it forward with a sleek new look. As you might imagine, not everyone?ôs onboard.
Reddit?ôs redesign is the most radical change in the site?ôs history. It takes the site?ôs one-note post-centric interface and adds bells and whistles like a side panel, a banner image, and several different ways of viewing a subreddit. Here?ôs an example of a post from r/redesign, the subreddit dedicated to discussing the new look:

Along with the updated look, the redesign grants the users greater control over how their version of Reddit looks. You can change the appearance of posts from classic, compact (a condensed version of classic) and card. The last one places a greater emphasis on images. The side panel, which gives you quick access to your subreddits and feeds, can be toggled on and off. Users are even given the option, currently, of switching between the classic design and the redesign.
Reddit?ôs head of design, Diego Perez, reports the redesign has had constructive and positive feedback since the early days, when the design team tested rough designs over video calls with subreddit moderators. He told TNW the design team will be open to change even as the redesign launches to the general public:
We think of the redesign as a starting point, and it?ôs going to be something that ever-evolving. After launch, we?ôre still going to be taking feedback and making improvements.
But not all feedback was positive, as you might expect. You?ôre always going to get some pushback when you redesign anything popular ??remember the user backlash to the Snapchat layout update? (If you don?ôt, it was a petition with over a million signatures.) Reddit is no different. All you have to do is visit r/redesign and you?ôll see a plethora of unhappy users ??though, to be fair, you?ôll also see users justifying the changes and attempting to placate them.
Some communities in particular were not always amenable to the change. For example, moderators from the Change My View subreddit complained the new ?úpop-up window??for viewing posts makes the comments  ?úa secondary content experience.??
Other users have complained about the redesign breaking their subreddit?ôs functionality. For example, the college football subreddit (r/CFB) described at length how the redesign broke its detailed, CSS-based layout. Several other sports-based subreddits jumped in on the complaint, including r/hockey and r/soccer.
Andreas Gross, Reddit?ôs lead product manager working in the redesign, told TNW part of the purpose behind the redesign is to make the product easier on newcomers:
Familiarity was a very important aspect. We don?ôt want to shock people. But for new users, Reddit today is a really hard product to learn. We want to let more people experience what really makes Reddit special.
Reddit CEO Steve Huffman concurred with that in an interview with the Wall Street Journal:
There is always that change aversion. We believe everybody has a home on Reddit. The challenge is finding that home, particularly for new users. Helping them find their home, helping find their community and sense of belonging on Reddit, it?ôs something we?ôre not very good at. The redesign is a big effort towards making that better.
It remains to be seen if Reddit?ôs redesign is something users can just get used to, or if many will continue to push back against the changes.

To say this attracted some derision and skepticism would be a bit of an understatement. Derision because the quiz was obviously a test, and skepticism for the purpose of it. What can Facebook?ôs users do to define hate speech that experts and Facebook themselves haven?ôt already done?

I say it?ôs worth finding out.
The quiz may have been prompted in part by questions posed to CEO Mark Zuckerberg during his Congressional testimony last month ??specifically, he was asked by Senator John Thune what his company was doing to improve its detection of hate speech. Zuckerberg said he and his team were trying to develop AI familiar enough with the nuances of human speech to catch it, but that wouldn?ôt happen for another 5-10 years. Until then, he said, they would have to rely on human reporting.
I?ôm not suggesting this is something Facebook should deploy to all users ??the potential for abuse is too obvious to ignore. But if you deployed it to a randomly selected group of users, you?ôd be more likely to come up with results not too tainted by bias ??Facebook?ôs or anyone else?ôs.
To put it another way: this wouldn?ôt be a permanent fixture, with ?úhate speech??hovering under every innocuous food image on the site. But if it were deployed to some users for a while, and they reported everything they considered hate speech, then you would, with some margin of error, have a pool of user responses to the important question of what hate speech is. If properly reviewed by human eyes, the feedback of Facebook?ôs users on a sensitive issue which directly affects them could be invaluable.
For a better example of how this could look, check out Facebook?ôs infamous two-question survey from earlier this year, which was created so Facebook users could help the site identify trustworthy news sources. According to a Facebook spokesperson, the test wasn?ôt for everyone, and you couldn?ôt opt into it. It would be run with different sets of people who represented a cross-section of users. This ensured the site would get a variety of opinions, but not the overwhelming opinion of every last one of its billions of users.
A simple question like this doesn?ôt necessarily solve anything. But when the question of what constitutes unlawful and harmful speech affects Facebook?ôs users, it stands to reason you?ôd at least ask some of them the question.

71,apps,"At Facebook?ôs F8 conference yesterday, the company noted that it?ôd soon update Instagram with a revamped Explore tab to make it easier to discover fresh content that you might enjoy.
The refreshed version of Explore will bring a list of topics to the top of the screen, such as ?òanimals?? and ?òphotography?? tapping any one of them will reveal related posts as well as a bunch of popular hashtags that you can follow.
That?ôs all well and good, Instagram, but I?ôm hoping it also tackles the problem of low-quality posts in the Explore tab. It?ôs been on my mind for some time now, but I was excited to learn yesterday that I?ôm not the only one who feels this way:
Instagram Explore is now full of memes, stolen low-res photos, repetitive posts, and shitty clips. 
It used to be a photographers and photography enthusiasts paradise.

I?ôll admit that I?ôm guilty of tainting the waters by searching for rubbish on Instagram, just for laughs (who doesn?ôt look for douchebags doing stupid things? Just me?), and not it seems like I?ôve broken the app. It won?ôt stop surfacing crappy posts I don?ôt care for. As a result, I don?ôt use the Explore tab very much.
It?ôd be great to see this feature supported with either better AI or human curation, so as to filter out posts of poor quality and actually help me find interesting new creators and imagery on the platform ??not just mountains of content vaguely related to things I?ôve searched for or profiles I follow. That hasn?ôt happened for a while now, and there?ôs certainly an opportunity for Instagram to fix things and get people to spend more time within the app.
It remains to be seen if the introduction of topic channels will help improve the experience; we?ôll find out in the coming weeks as the new Explore tab rolls out globally.

72,apps,"At its F8 conference yesterday, Facebook announced that it?ôs bringing group video chats to both Instagram and WhatsApp in future updates.
On Instagram, you?ôll soon find a new camera icon in your Direct conversation screens; tapping it will initiate an instant video call, and you can minimize it to continue navigating across the rest of the app.

This will work with both individual contacts as well as with ?òsmall??groups. Facebook didn?ôt specify exactly how many users will be supported per call, but from the previews we?ôve seen, it looks like you?ôll be limited to four people at a time. This feature is currently being tested and will roll out globally in the next few weeks.
We first heard of this feature back in March; at the time, I wrote that I wasn?ôt sure how Instagram would allow you to maintain your privacy and block unwanted calls; right now, you can initiate a conversation with anyone in the app, even if their profile is protected and they don?ôt follow you. Yeah, we?ôre gonna want a ?ònope??button of some sort for that.

As for WhatsApp, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted that people have already used some 2 billion minutes of one-on-one video calling on the messaging service, so it?ôs set to roll out group video chats in the coming months.
Again, there?ôs no word on just how many users will be supported simultaneously; it?ôll be interesting to see how the app?ôs interface handles call requests and invites, especially for groups with plenty of members.
With that, Facebook has three apps (Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger) vying to be your weapon of choice for connecting with your contacts, and they?ôre starting to feel somewhat similar. That?ôs not a bad thing yet ??but hopefully these products will continue to be able to offer distinctly differentiated experiences in the future ??or there won?ôt be a reason to keep more than any one of them on your phone.

So much so, that some people have turned to the pared-down Messenger Lite instead.
Now Facebook is trying to remedy Messenger?ôs bloat with a new design, which it teased today at its F8 conference in California. Based on the teaser trailer, the new app reduces the plethora of buttons and tabs to just three sections, while there are now camera and call buttons at the top of your chat list. Pardon the low quality images ??Facebook?ôs video feed wasn?ôt exactly 4K.

Within conversation, Facebook cut down the number of buttons from six to four. As far as we can know Facebook isn?ôt actually removing any features, so any omissions were likely combined with other buttons. Also note the new gradient chat bubbles, which makes Messenger a bit more like Skype. The company said the new app would be faster too.
Oh yeah, it?ôs also getting a dark mode, in case you didn?ôt notice in the header image. Hoorah!

One of the ways Facebook is making the creation easier is to provide a number of art assets.

Facebook is also adding features which will streamline the process. Among other things, it?ôll have:
The most useful innovations are probably the new kind of tracking. The AR Studio offers target tracking (objects), face tracking, hand tracking, and body tracking. Finally, Facebook will soon allow users to distribute their new AR to Messenger, Instagram, and Facebook Lite, though that feature remains in closed beta for now.

77,apps,"The European Emergency Number Association (EENA) just announced the launch of PEMEA architecture at its conference in Slovenia. PEMEA stands for Pan-European Mobile Emergency App and the architecture was created by EENA, Beta80, and Deveryware to enable emergency apps to contact emergency services across borders in Europe.
This hasn?ôt been possible up until now with most emergency apps only working within limited areas. TNW is in Ljubljana, and we spoke with Christina Lumbreras, technical director of EENA, and Luca Bergonzi, sales executive at Beta80, to understand better what the PEMEA architecture can do to save people?ôs lives.
?úLet?ôs say a 112 center in Europe has created it?ôs own emergency app for its citizens ??like many have done ??the problem they face is that if people go out of the country or outside the region the app won?ôt work. For example, I live in Brussels and if I have an emergency here in Slovenia my first instinct is to open the Belgian emergency app, rather than the Slovenian one,??explains Lumbreras.
During an emergency people act on instinct so it?ôs important to make sure that the apps work no matter where the person is because the added information emergency apps provide can be invaluable. Lumbreras says that currently, in a best case scenario, her Belgian app would call Slovenian emergency services but wouldn?ôt send any of the additional data. However, often when apps are used outside their intended region the local emergency services won?ôt even hear the person in need ??which can be a life-threatening problem.
?úThe reason why we need PEMEA is that there are hundreds of emergency apps in use across Europe but some of them aren?ôt even officially connected to 112 or public safety forces,??says Bergonzi. ?úSo there are a lot of apps out there that can benefit from becoming a part of PEMEA because they could be used for their original purpose, across borders.??
This will allow emergency services to use every resource available to them, increasing the likelihood of averting life-threatening situation. But after seeing a lot of advancements in automatic geo-location tech, for example the implementation of Advanced Mobile Location (AML) in Android devices ??and recently iOS as well ??aren?ôt emergency apps becoming obsolete? Apps require forethought and preparation, while AML works automatically during emergency calls, sending incredibly detailed location data to emergency services.
Bergonzi disagrees and explains that while AML is a great addition to the available tools for emergency services, it?ôs limited in what type of data it can provide first responders. ?úI think apps are much more crucial than AML. Apps can deliver more data, while AML is just location. Also, AML will soon become a completely automatic function of emergency calls everywhere while apps will keep developing. They will be able to offer video calls, chatting, data concerning the user, and other added value services ??that only apps can bring.??
Bergonzi also feels that the quantity of emergency apps isn?ôt bad, while some would think it would muddy the waters, Bergonzi believes in the more the merrier ??as long as they can directly connect to emergency services.
If you have an app and let?ôs say it?ôs been downloaded by 15 percent of the population. These people make around three to four percent of the emergency calls with the app, while the other forget. The reason is that apps need to be marketed heavily and people need to be taught to remember to use them.
But what if we had more than just this one app? If we had three, four, or even more apps connected to the emergency services this percentage could go up to six, then nine percent, and so on. The more apps you have the higher the chance is that people call using an app that provides even more detailed information to dispatchers.
In the first year of the project, the goal is to have at least four European countries the PEMEA platform ??with Spain and Italy already confirmed ??and hopefully over eight countries by the end of 2019. To get an app connected to the PEMEA architecture, it needs to fulfill necessary eligibility criteria which can be found on the EENA website.
Bergonzi and Lumbreras also stress that although the PEMEA seems focused on apps, it?ôs also important to get emergency services on board to implement PEMEA on their end ??even if they don?ôt have an official emergency app in their country. The reason is that they?ôd instantly gain access to all the benefits of already existing apps and thereby greatly improving the safety of their citizens.

78,apps,"Along with its Gmail design overhaul yesterday, Google relaunched its Tasks app. It?ôs now available within your Gmail inbox when you activate the new interface, as well as on Android and iOS.
Sadly, it?ôs as barebones as any to-do app I?ôve ever used. I?ôm all for apps that keep things simple and don?ôt overwhelm users with a boatload of features they won?ôt use often ??but at the moment, Tasks isn?ôt better than anything else out there, not even Google?ôs own Keep note-taking app.

As it stands, Tasks lets you create lists and add to-dos within each of them; you can add textual details, a due date for sorting items chronologically, and sub-tasks.
And that?ôs it.

You can?ôt set reminders, share lists with others, assign tasks to people, add tags, send text from a different app to turn it into a to-do, or even have it recognize things like ?òtomorrow??and ?ònext week??to automatically set dates. Heck, there isn?ôt even a home screen widget or support for adding tasks with Google Assistant.
Google defended the lack of features in a Wired piece by talking up ?úthe strength of a simple-to-use and straightforward tasks app.??
But Tasks product manager Florian Goerisch also noted that there are plans to bring additional features to the app. So, while I appreciate the thinking behind Tasks, I don?ôt see myself using it extensively or recommending it until it gets better at the one job it?ôs designed to handle.
With Tasks, Google seems to be making the same mistakes as Microsoft did, when it launched To-Do, a basic task manager that was meant to replace the feature-packed Wunderlist app it acquired in 2016.
In trying to strip a to-do app down to the basics, the company has missed out on essential functionality that most folks would expect in a modern app, and that would make for a more comfortable user experience without muddying up the interface. Its only major selling point is that it shows up in Gmail?ôs new sidebar.
But so does Google Keep ??and it?ôs great for task management. You can use it to create lists, tag and share them, and set reminders. There are plenty more features that I?ôm not going to get into ??but essentially, this is Keep beating Tasks at its own game.
I understand that even in its current form, Tasks might find a fan or two. But there?ôs clearly room for improvement, and it strikes me as odd that Google would choose to launch a product that?ôs clearly in the early stages of development. Hopefully, it will get better over time, with the same guiding principle of simplicity in mind.

According to the outlet?ôs source, Google Play Music will be replaced by the upcoming YouTube Remix platform, which is slated to launch later this year, and existing Play Music users will be migrated to the new service by the end of 2018.
A statement from YouTube seems to corroborate this, with hints of notifications about migrating to the upcoming service:
We?ôve previously announced the combination of the YouTube Music and Google Play product teams ??music is very important to Google so it?ôs critical we have one offering that meets the needs of consumers and artists. Nothing will change for users today and we?ôll provide plenty of notice before any changes are made.
It?ôs worth noting that YouTube Remix was expected to launch at SXSW back in March, but Google denied that it had such plans.
While it certainly makes sense to combine YouTube?ôs vast catalog of music videos and Google Play Music?ôs immense audio library, it remains to be seen exactly how this will play out. Google Play Music is available in many more countries than YouTube?ôs Red subscription service for ad-free playback is, so there may be complications around licensing video content globally.
With streaming music on the upswing lately (it grew by $2.1 billion year-on-year globally to reach $7.4 billion in 2017), and rivals like Deezer and Spotify introducing new features to keep things fresh for fans, it?ôs high time Google stepped up its game.

What it is: The complete list of community standards is divided up into six sections, each one tackling the specifics of a kind of content. For example, they have different lists for objectionable content, such as hate speech, and respecting intellectual property. Each section is now augmented with very specific rules about what is and is not a violation of the standards.
According to Monika Bickert, Facebook?ôs VP of Global Policy Management, the rules haven?ôt changed. The company is just revealing how it handles violations:
?¶for the first time, we are publishing the internal implementation guidelines that our content reviewers use to make decisions about what?ôs allowed on Facebook.
Why it matters: Facebook is currently being grilled for a lack of transparency in a flurry of data privacy scandals, which have made it all the way to Senate hearings. A criticism leveled at the company for years has been its lack of openness with regards to what content is allowed on its platform. Stories of inconsistent treatment and unfair content takedowns are as old as Facebook itself. Now users have written rules they can point to when questioning a decision.
But wait. There?ôs more: In addition to making the guidelines public, Facebook is also opening an appeals process for users who feel their material was removed in error. If the company wants to make appeals more constructive, it needs to give users the option to appeal when the company doesn?ôt take down content ??frequently users can be frustrated when content they find offensive or harmful isn?ôt removed from the site.

85,apps,"Amazon?ôs Alexa has rolled out a new UK feature: announcements. Innovatively titled Alexa Announcements, it allows users to broadcast their voice to other Echo units in the house. This is different to the intercom feature, as rather than a one-on-one conversation, it?ôs transmitted to every device.
And, well, to my eyes, it?ôs a feature ripe to be taken advantage of.
Amazon chose to illustrate Alexa Announcements with the example of, presumably, a parent saying to the device ?úAlexa, announce that dinner is ready.??This would then cause all other Echo units on the network to play ?údinner is ready??in the speaker?ôs voice.
It?ôs a genuinely useful feature, but I feel the tone of the release is??optimistic. Anyone who has grown up in a household filled with children or, well, twenty-somethings, knows that the most innocuous things can be used in the most irritating ways. Alexa Announcements is no exception.
So, in honor of this game changing feature, we wanted to put together a short list of tips on how to abuse Alexa Announcements the right way. For the kids (and the kids in us), you know?
I realize the first thing you?ôll want to do is to get Alexa to scream ?úfuck??or ?úshit??or ?úasshole,??but, if you?ôre a teen or under, this is going to get the device taken away from you faster than you can say ?úbeating.??Instead, stick to words it?ôs harder to get in trouble with, like ?ústinks??or ?úsucks??or ?úbutt??or ?úpoo.??
And if you?ôre a house full of adults? Just dive in straight for the X-rated words. They never get old.
What, your housemates aren?ôt familiar with Death Grips??oeuvre? Broadcast them snippets of the music so they too can enjoy the group?ôs genre-defying work.

Parents not into Lil??Pump? Introduce them to Gucci Gang. Again. And again. And again.
Alexa Announcements is perfect for tattling. Whether you want to gain an upper hand in the eternal sibling struggle for dominance or shame a housemate for stealing someone?ôs broccoli, there?ôs no better tool for announcing their wrongdoings to the whole house.

Whether child or adult, surely everyone has received a message in a group chat saying ?úwho spilt juice on the kitchen counter? This really isn?ôt acceptable, I?ôm not here to clean up after your messes. Grow the hell up.??
Limiting yourself to sending these sort of messages via text seems archaic. Use your voice. Your strained, close-to-tears voice. Repeatedly.
If you use one of these totally legit voice-changers no one will even know it?ôs you. Extra points if you can just say ?úAlexa, announce?¶‚Ä?and then play a high-pitch screech through the speaker.
You?ôre in the house alone. You hear someone else come in. The plots of Saw and Scream come flooding into your head. You use the Echo devices in the house to try out your own brand of psychological horror. It fails and they don?ôt talk to you for a week. Result.

The BBC has been broadcasting the shipping forecast ??the weather report for the seas and coasts around Britain ??for over 150 years. The thing is, who?ôs got the time to tune in at 5:20am to hear it?
With Alexa Announcements, you can be the savior the household needs. Methodically repeat the report into the device bit-by-bit, so everyone knows the weather in Lundy, Cromarty, North Utsire, Fastnet, and more.
This also works with the football results, just make sure you start from the lowest leagues and go upwards.
Remember, abusing Alexa Announcements once is funny, but twice isn?ôt. Around fifty times though? Hilarious.

Alexa Announcements are enabled now in the UK, as well as the US and Canada. If you?ôd like to torture those you live with, you can pick up an Echo here.

Flickr is great for when you want an easy way to upload your pictures and show them off quickly; you get 1TB of storage for free, and you can organize your shots into albums, as well as assign various types of usage rights to them. Once your pictures have been uploaded, you can publicly display them on the web and in Flickr?ôs mobile apps.
A paid plan ($5.99 a month or $49.99 a year) nets you advanced analytics, access to the desktop auto-uploading tool, and discounts on things like prints, Adobe Lightroom presets, and Portfoliobox?ôs website creation service.
SmugMug, on the other hand, doesn?ôt offer a free tier. Instead, its subscriptions start at $3.99 a month (billed annually) and come with a customizable site to showcase your images, as well as unlimited storage space for them. You can also share them via social networks, and order prints and gifts made with your pictures from the site. Pricier plans allow you to sell your photos for commercial use. It arguably offers more control than Flickr over how you share your pictures, as well as more options for monetizing your work.
If you aren?ôt yet sure which to go with, both companies offer free trials so you can get a taste of their services before you pony up for either.

87,apps,"Facebook is working on a new feature to hook in the one market that they?ôve struggled to dominate: teenagers. ?òHigh School Networks for Messenger??appears to be its latest attempt to drag post-millennials to its platform, according to sources who shared screenshots with TNW.
High School Networks appears to be a way for students to connect with their peers at the same school and/or taking the same classes. The details for the feature are limited at the moment, as the feature appears to be hidden and is yet to go live in the latest version of Messenger in the App Store.
One of our sources decompiled the latest version of the Messenger app on iOS, leading to the discovery of this feature. The source wishes to remain anonymous for fears of Facebook limiting their access.
 
Separately, computer scientist student Jane Manchun Wong was able to locate additional information from within Messenger to show text strings related to the feature.
Wong found a list of pre-defined text strings inside the feature which would be displayed to Messenger users who have the feature enabled and are currently students at an enrolled high school. This gives us some clues as to what High School Networks may enable students to do.
These text strings suggest features such as:

Facebook declined to comment on this feature, so it?ôs hard to tell at this stage how a school can enroll to use it. More importantly, it remains to be seen how the verification process will work for people attempting to join a High School Network ??how it will confirm they actually are a current student at that school.
In December 2017, Facebook launched Messenger for Kids. Its first attempt at providing a limited and parent-led version of the main Messenger app. This was criticised by both parents, academics and the media due to how Facebook funded the ?òexperts??consulted with when building the app, as well as fears over how usage data of the app would be used.
By creating a Messenger feature built around a teenager?ôs school, it could help form social networking habits at a key life stage.
If it?ôs ever launched, High School Networks for Messenger has the potential to be a useful tool for students and teachers to build friendship and study groups, as well as improve relationships between people at key institutions in our society.
However, it also has the potential to be abused and create one almighty PR mess for Facebook to manage if things go wrong. Questions over how people wishing to join a school network would be verified as actual students of the school, and concerns over the risks of bullying and harassment between users will no doubt be raised.
Update (23 April)
Facebook may require students to upload a selfie alongside a photo of their school ID in order to join a ?òHigh School Network??on Messenger.

"
88,apps,"Earlier this month, Facebook promised to implement an unsend message (revoke) option for all Messenger users. Well, it looks like the feature is almost ready to go live.
TNW obtained this screenshot of how the button looks set to appear in Messenger. The screenshot came from a reliable source who agreed to share it with us on the condition of anonymity.

While Facebook toyed around with the idea of giving users the ability to unsend messages in WhatsApp last year (and later implemented the feature for all users), the company has yet to try this out with Messenger.
There?ôs no way of telling when Facebook will actually implement the feature for all users, but the discovery of its existence hidden inside the latest build of the Messenger app on iOS could mean it won?ôt be long.
To recap, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg got caught in a PR storm over the deletion of messages sent using Messenger. Not only were they deleted from his own inbox, they also disappeared from the people?ôs inboxes they were originally sent to. Critics jumped on the fact Zuckerberg didn?ôt appear to be managing his own Facebook privacy in quite the same way his platform promotes and allows others.
We contacted Facebook for comment about this latest development. We will update this post if they provide further information.
So?¶Will you be hitting that unsend messages button hard and often once it arrives? Let us know in the comments.

89,apps,
90,apps,"As a tech-savvy TNW reader, you may have already ditched SMS for more sophisticated messaging apps years ago, but people still send some 8 trillion texts a year ??and that means that it?ôs worth improving the experience for those folks, and for the rest of the planet that?ôs yet to send their first message.
To that end, Google is building Chat, a texting experience that will replace traditional SMS on Android devices. It?ôs built on the Universal Profile for Rich Communication Services standard ??aka RCS ??and it?ôll roll out sometime in the next several months. The Verge has an excellent explainer on how it?ôll work:

Essentially, if you and your contact are rocking Android phones with carriers that support RCS, you?ôll enjoy a bunch of modern messaging features when you text them, such as read receipts, typing indicators, full-resolution images and video, and even group chats.
You?ôll be charged for the data consumed in sending your message, instead of what it?ôd cost on your plan to send an SMS. And if you text someone who doesn?ôt have Chat enabled (that includes iOS users), they?ôll receive plain ol??SMS messages.
That?ôs kind of like what Apple offers its iOS users with iMessage. And even Microsoft supports RCS, so it?ôs possible that we?ôll be able to link our phones to our desktops and text people from Windows 10 machines too.
But there?ôs one big difference: unlike iMessage, Chat isn?ôt encrypted. That means that your messages will be stored on your carrier?ôs servers in a readable format that governments could request and access if they decide to investigate you for all your heinous crimes and criminal wrongdoings.
So, should you be excited about Chat? To be honest, there?ôs nothing that Chat will offer to trump your modern messaging app of choice; it?ôs simply dragging SMS into the 21st century. You?ôre certainly better off sticking with an encrypted service like WhatsApp, Telegram or Signal.
It?ôll certainly be good for folks who will get started with mobile devices for the first time once Chat launches, as they?ôll get to experience feature-rich texting even before they sign up for a messaging service.
It?ôs a huge deal for Android, and a major achievement for Google, as it?ôs managed to partner with some 50+ carriers worldwide and numerous hardware makers to garner support for RCS and make this possible. The company has also put development of its Allo messaging app on hold; since launching it in September 2016, it?ôs failed to drum up interest in Allo.
Anil Sabharwal, who?ôs heading up the project at Google, speculates that you should see Chat start to become available in the US by the end of the year, and more widely thereafter; the company will also continue to enhance the Android messaging app with more features, and even roll out a desktop web interface for Chat soon enough.

92,apps,"Shortly after the Cambridge Analytica debacle broke out, heaps of high-profile celebrities and brands ??including Elon Musk, and his ventures SpaceX and Tesla ??went on to delete their Facebook pages. But it appears these admirable acts of protest might have been nothing more than a self-serving case of virtue signalling.
Contrary to Musk?ôs promise to delete the accounts, it seems that Tesla and SpaceX have instead opted to unpublish their official Facebook pages. This means that the pages are not deleted, but merely invisible to users for the time being.
What?ôs Facebook?
??Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 23, 2018

I didn?ôt realize there was one. Will do.
??Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 23, 2018

That is also the reason why the pages display an error message stating that the content is not available ?úright now??or ?úmay only be visible to an audience you?ôre not in.??
As developer Ananay Arora explains, deleted pages tend to return a message saying that the page ?úisn?ôt available??or ?úmay have been removed.??By comparison, unpublished pages simply say that the ?úcontent isn?ôt available right now.??
The developer has demonstrated that links to the now-inactive Tesla and SpaceX accounts return an error message that corresponds with pages which have been temporarily unpublished ??and not deleted.
Arora has documented his findings in a video. Those interested can see the footage below:
Meanwhile, this is not the only evidence suggesting Tesla and SpaceX have not deleted their pages.
Arora also found that running the URL associated with the inactive Tesla page through Facebook?ôs developer tools returns a status code that doesn?ôt coincide with a deleted page.
Further evidence is found when checking the status code of the Facebook Page URL using developer tools vs. A url of Page that had been deleted / does not exist

??Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) April 13, 2018

Facebook stipulates that deleted pages have 14 days to revert the decision before they disappear permanently. A permanent removal also results losing the numerical Facebook ID associated with the page URL.
Musk instructed his social media team to delete the pages on March 23 last month. 25 days later, both SpaceX and Tesla still have an active Facebook ID.
TNW has been able to confirm that pages which have been deleted for longer than 14 days lose their numerical Facebook ID.
Instead of a numerical ID, the ID lookup tool returns the following:

If the pages are indeed unpublished (and it sure looks like it), the now-inactive pages can be resumed at will at any point in time ??keeping their five million followers. A deleted page needs to start anew and to build its user base from the ground up.
Asked about the possibility to return to Facebook in the future, Tesla told TNW it has no ?úupdate at this point.??
It is hardly surprising that Tesla and SpaceX have elected to unpublish their Facebook pages rather than deleting them permanently ??especially factoring in their large audiences. Still though, it is somewhat hypocritical to make bold claims in public while keeping their options wide open.
Indeed, Tesla and SpaceX are not the only ones to pull this trick. Playboy too decided to ?úsuspend [?? activity on the platform??following the Cambridge Analytica. Unlike Musk though, the company hinted that this is only a temporary measure.

"
93,apps,"The recent Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal has sparked plenty of interesting conversations about the value of our data, the future of Facebook, and the relevance of social networks.
It also led CEO Mark Zuckerberg to address the question of whether there?ôd ever be a paid version of Facebook; when testifying before US Congress, he didn?ôt entirely rule it out. And today, BuzzFeed News combed through the company?ôs financials and did the math to figure out what a Facebook subscription would cost: $11 a month.
That would net you an ad-free experience on the social network ??and hopefully, make the company significantly less dependent on users??data for monetization (though it might still use it for personalizing your feed). Effectively, it could also mean less susceptibility to manipulation by malicious foreign actors, as in the case of Russia meddling in the last US presidential election.
But as a veteran user who?ôs clocked 11 years on Facebook, it feels like there?ôs virtually no reason to stick around there any longer.
Back when I was active on Facebook, the first thing I?ôd look at is my notifications ??but lately, the shiny red notification counter has lost its meaning. Here?ôs what I get when I click on it these days:
Notice how none of those notifications have anything to do with me. It?ôs obviously a sign of reduced interactions between the people in my network and me, but it?ôs also indicative of a breaking down of one of the most crucial aspects of Facebook: its variable rewards.
In his book Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products, author Nir Eyal describes how services can offer users rewards for activities like logging in or sharing something. In the case of Facebook, it?ôs something as simple as letting you know someone saw and liked a photo of yours.
Now, when you see a bright red badge saying you?ôve got X notifications, and you don?ôt know what those are until you click them, the dopamine levels in your brain tend to increase because you?ôre expecting a reward ??and you?ôre hoping to be surprised by exactly what it is (a like, a comment, or a mention in a discussion).
Over the past few months, I?ôve learned that there?ôs almost never anything interesting to see when I click that red notification badge ??so no dopamine surge, and no further interaction.
Next, let me draw your attention to my news feed. I once liked a post that my friend?ôs father shared, and so now Facebook has decided that it must display content from him as regularly as possible, in between sponsored posts and those from all the biryani enthusiast groups I joined several months ago. I love and respect the man, but this is a bit much. Thanks, almighty algorithm.

At this point, the only thing Facebook is really good for, is for tracking events. The company actually has a separate app for that, but sadly, it?ôs only available in the US.
Perhaps more importantly, I?ôm no longer keen on a steady diet of what my friends are up to. That may be partly due to the fact that i?ôm now in my early 30s, as are many of my contacts; it seems like we tend to share more on Instagram, and privately via messaging apps, than anywhere else. Plus, I?ôve been actively trying to wean myself off of addictive apps, and Facebook?ôs dreary experience has helped me cut it out of my life almost entirely in the past few weeks.
Between losing trust in the brand, seeing its novelty wearing off in my circle of friends and loved ones, and finding less utility in the service, I feel like it?ôs time to part ways with Facebook ??the same way a million North Americans did at the end of last year. As I?ôve mentioned above, it?ôs not entirely the company?ôs fault ??but if we?ôre now pondering whether we?ôd like to pay for it, I?ôm afraid that that ship has sailed.
That being said, I?ôm happy to continue using its other products, namely Instagram and WhatsApp. I?ôd even consider paying for those, if that?ôd help keep my data private. Heck, with Instagram, I mostly don?ôt even mind the ads, and in some cases, I enjoy them ??it?ôs how I?ôve discovered a number of excellent local apparel brands that I now shop with regularly.
I don?ôt think my logic applies universally to the entire lot of Facebook?ôs currently registered users, and I imagine that it?ôll still be delightful, exciting, and useful to those who are yet to try it for the first time. But in thinking about whether I?ôd pay for it as a long-time user, it raises a question about whether Facebook knows how to keep people engaged and loyal to its social network over decades. And right now, the answer is a resounding no.

94,apps,"A bunch of Google employees participating in the company?ôs Area 120 internal incubator have launched Grasshopper, a free mobile app for Android and iOS that teaches you the basics of programming.
It?ôs beautifully designed and is suitable for just about anyone who can be trusted to use a phone on their own. By solving simple challenges and answering quiz questions, you?ôll soon get the hang of basic JavaScript.

The gamified app, named after programming pioneer Grace Hopper, currently includes three sets of lessons, which cover the fundamentals of coding (calling functions, using variables and objects, and so on), as well as animations. The idea is to spend a few minutes a day with it, so you can have the app remind you to hop in daily and take on a few challenges.
When you?ôre done with the content in Grasshopper, you can move on to recommended Coursera classes to learn more about JavaScript, HTML, CSS, algorithms, and web design for a fee, or simply muck around in Grashopper?ôs online playground and make your own JS animations. Naturally, you can also explore alternatives for learning to code, such as the courses offered by edX and FreeCodeCamp.
I?ôve been meaning to get back to coding for a while now, having ditched my chops when I graduated from high school. The app is fun and easy enough to get through a few challenges when you?ôre on a commute, and feels like a good alternative to scrolling through social media feeds mindlessly.
Grasshopper is the latest product to emerge from Area 120, which gives Google employees a chance to work full-time on their side projects and bring them to life. It?ôs previously seen launches like Uptime, which lets you watch YouTube videos in sync with friends elsewhere in the world, and Supersonic, a messaging app for emoji lovers.

95,apps,"Apple?ôs AirDrop service is great for beaming files between your iOS and Mac devices over Wi-Fi ??but it sadly doesn?ôt work with other platforms. Thankfully, a bunch of young developers have built a handy tool to make it just as easy to transfer files over your local network, using anything that has a web browser.
It?ôs called Plover, and it?ôs dead-simple to use: just point your browser to this page, and you?ôll be assigned a private ?òroom??(which is restricted to your Wi-Fi network) and an animal avatar to identify your device. Fire up the site on another device that?ôs connected to the same Wi-Fi network, and it?ôll show up in the same room with a different avatar. You can then drag and drop files onto the page to start transferring them instantly.
That negates the need to copy links, or send them to others (or yourself) over email; to identify yourself among a bunch of users in the same room, you only need to let people know which animal avatar you?ôve been assigned so they can click on it to send you a file.
I personally use tools like Pushbullet, AirDroid, and even Slack to send myself full resolution photos, PDFs and APKs, but Plover is arguably quicker, and doesn?ôt require you to install any of the aforementioned apps.
It works equally well on desktop and mobile, though it could benefit from the inclusion of tooltips to explain how users can select recipients and upload files (on mobile, tapping on an avatar brings up the upload dialog to browse your device storage and find files to send).
At present, you can send as many files as you?ôd like, provided they?ôre under 1GB each. Up to 50 users can join a room at the same time. Developer William Okuno says these restrictions will soon be adjusted, so you can beam files up to 5GB in size, have 500 people in the same room, and choose which users you want to send files to, simultaneously.
Okuno says Plover is still in the works, and is being developed by three students, one of whom is still attending high school. The team plans to monetize the app through ads in dedicated mobile apps, and also introduce more features, such as virus scanning, the ability to join rooms from anywhere via custom URLs, and additional nodes across the world for improved performance.
Give Plover a go by visiting this site; there?ôs no need to sign up, so you can get started right away.

The big question about Internet, though, is, why did Amazon build it? The company already has its Silk browser running on its Android-based Fire tablets and phones, but that app isn?ôt available in the Amazon Appstore for India.

97,apps,"A former employee of the notorious data broker Cambridge Analytica (CA) today testified the company had several other quizzes on Facebook besides the one which started Facebook?ôs current audit ??and potentially they could have compromised far more than the 87 million people Facebook estimated.
The British Parliament?ôs Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport Committee is now conducting an inquiry into Facebook and Cambridge Analytica?ôs misappropriation of user data. Yesterday, former CA executive Brittany Kaiser testified before the committee about the company?ôs actions. You can read her full written testimony here.
With regards to CA?ôs Facebook activities, here is the most interesting part of Kaiser?ôs testimony:
I should emphasise that the Kogan/GSR datasets and questionnaires were not the only Facebook-connected questionnaires and datasets which Cambridge Analytica used. I am aware in a general sense of a wide range of surveys which were done by CA or its partners, usually with a Facebook login ??for example, the ?úsex compass??quiz. I do not know the specifics of these surveys or how the data was acquired or processed. But I believe it is almost certain that the number of Facebook users whose data was compromised through routes similar to that used by Kogan is much greater than 87 million; and that both Cambridge Analytica and other unconnected companies and campaigns were involved in these activities.
If true, it would mean Facebook might have many more ?úThis Is Your Digital Lifes??out there. She doesn?ôt give details on any of the quizzes, but she did tell the committee in spoken testimony that she believes the quizzes were designed with the intention of harvesting data.
Kaiser specifies that she ?únever handled Cambridge Analytica?ôs data models or any significant datasets??and the research was done before her time. She only found out about the quizzes in 2015, thanks to an article in The Guardian. She said her broader knowledge of the quizzes only came about thanks to investigations of the last few weeks.
We?ôve contacted Facebook for more information about the quizzes she?ôs talking about. We?ôll update if we hear more ??I?ôm especially curious to know what this ?úsex compass??quiz is.
The exact number of quizzes may be moot, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg has already specified that all of Facebook?ôs users should assume their data has been compromised by search vulnerabilities.

98,apps,"A few months after Snapchat opened its Lens Studio, allowing anyone to make their own versions of the app?ôs augmented reality filters ??the company today announced it?ôs now allowing its users to make their own face Lenses, a.k.a. the ones Snapchat is famous for.
When the Studio first opened last year, its creators were given multiple tools for creating Lenses that worked in the world, which many of them used to great effect. Nevertheless, while several have been very inventive and amusing, none of them have quite risen to the level of ubiquity that Snapchat?ôs face filters enjoy.

The templates include AR baseball caps, face paint, and distortions. You can script templates to trigger when you make certain facial expressions, such as raising your eyebrows or sticking out your tongue. If you really want to get crazy, you can stick 2D and 3D objects ??such as bunny ears or AR makeup ??to the Snapchatter?ôs face.
The company announced a few months ago that it was rolling out a creator which would let users build their own geofiltered Lenses. But these were all event-specific, and users could only select from a predetermined number of effects and objects. Now users anywhere can make and upload a greater variety of Lenses.
In addition to the above, Snapchat also announced it would be promoting user-created Lenses by creating a public Story specifically for them. If you see a Lens you like in the Discover tab, you?ôll be able to unlock it for yourself by swiping up.

There have been hundreds of great user Lenses already ??according to Snapchat, 30,000 Lenses were submitted for approval in two months, and they were viewed over 1 billion times.

This is the image Google posted:

Notice anything odd? Look at the navigation bar:

Here?ôs what it normally looks like on a Pixel 2 running Android O (or the current Android P beta, for that matter):

Where did the recents button go? Why is the back button using the old hollow design? And who squished the home button into a pill?
While I?ôd like to think Google?ôs Android Team got drunk and experimented with wacky designs, all signs point that gesture navigation is ??at the very least ??being considered for Android P.
According to Stephan Hall from 9to5Google (h/t ArsTechnica), it?ôs ??00%??gesture navigation. The recents button was removed, and the back button only appears temporarily ??explaining the lopsided look. And as pointed out by Ars, Android P has a new sliding animation when navigating within an app, which would jive nicely with swiping gestures. That seems like it would make a disappearing back button redundant, but maybe Google just doesn?ôt want to confuse long-time Android users.
Google has since removed the evidence, cropping the image to only show off the feature it actually meant to show off. Since we don?ôt want whomever wrote uploaded the image to feel too guilty, that?ôs support for DNS over TLS, if that means anything to you.
Though a variety of Android manufacturers have implemented navigation gestures over the years, Google might be considering the move in stock Android in response to the iPhone X and ever-shrinking bezels. In theory, gesture-based navigation could  allow you to shrink the navigation bar and save some screen real estate, although that doesn?ôt appear to be the case in this particular image.
It?ôs worth reiterating this might not necessarily make it into the final version of Android P; just look at Dark Mode. Nor am I convinced it should replace the traditional navigation bar. But as someone who?ôs been fond of gesture navigation since the Palm Pre, I?ôd be happy to see it return as an optional configuration. With Google I/O coming up in a few weeks, it likely won?ôt be long until this mystery is resolved.

To switch back, go to the same menu and select ?òGo back to classic Gmail.??
At the time of writing, the new Gmail option wasn?ôt available to us, so it?ôs possible that this is a gradual rollout that will slowly reach all users.
Our original story follows.
Yesterday, Google confirmed a major redesign for Gmail was on the way. We?ôd seen drafts of a redesign dating back nearly a year ago and heard some descriptions of the new look, but after yesterday?ôs news, several sources shared images of the new design itself ??including some new features.
Other than the addition of snoozing and smart replies ??which we already knew were coming ??the key feature of the new design is a modular sidebar that allows it to integrate with other Google apps.
 
As shown by The Verge, there?ôs a new sidebar that lets you use Calendar, Keep, or Tasks right next to your email. That means you never have to leave your inbox to create a to-do list or reschedule a meeting. It?ôs also not a stretch to imagine other apps will be able to integrate with this section, and TechCrunch reports that?ôs indeed the case.
Google Tasks, by the way, has also long been ready for a revamp. Android Authority shared some images of showing off a new Tasks icon that suggests a new design is also imminent.
For reference, this is what Google Tasks looks like right now??in 2018:

Yeah, I?ôd say it needs an update. If you access it from your email, it?ôs mostly a simple check list with due dates. Considering Keep can already pull double duty as a barebones to-do list, I?ôm hoping Google has some new features in tow.
The new look isn?ôt a radical departure from the gmail of old, but it does bring Gmail more in line with Google?ôs current brand of Material Design ??note the bubble ?òCompose??button.

The new Gmail also lets you choose between a few different display modes. The current version of Gmail lets you choose between compact, cozy, and comfortable sizes, but it only really affects spacing between emails.
The new gmail replaces the cozy setting with a new mode simply labeled ?òdefault??which highlights attachments within your messages.
Lastly, there appears to be a new loading animation, which is neat, I guess.
Credit: The VergeUpdate (April 25): For folks who need to send sensitive information, Gmail is also getting a new confidential mode, which will let remove the option to forward, copy, download or print messages. Plus, you can also make a message expire after a set period of time to help you stay in control of your information.

A spokesperson told TechCrunch:
We are building a new data portability tool. You?ôll soon be able to download a copy of what you?ôve shared on Instagram, including your photos, videos and messages.
That?ôs the first step it?ôs taken in giving users more control over their data in recent times, and in providing a simple way to take your content off Instagram, whether to create a personal archive, or to move to a different social network.
It?ôs similar to the Download Your Information tool that Facebook has offered since 2010; that tool offers a more comprehensive package of your interactions on the network, and was recently found to include logs of your calls and text messages dating back years.
Instagram says it?ôll soon share more details about exactly what your download will contain, and whether it?ôll include things like your following and follower lists, comments, and Stories.
That?ôs not just Instagram being good to its users: it?ôs also a crucial step in complying with the European Union?ôs GDPR privacy regulations, which will make data portability mandatory for such services when they go into effect next month.
Instagram hasn?ôt come under fire for betraying users??trust the way Facebook has, so it?ôs mostly in the clear on that front ??for now. Offering data portability is a good start, and it should probably audit its inner workings to ensure that people?ôs data is truly safe and private, before any shit hits the fan.

To use Focus, open your Instagram Story and swipe to the option under the ?úRecord??button ??it?ôll be next to ?úSuperzoom.??After you do, focus your camera on a person, and the photo will automatically bring the person into focus while blurring the background. From there, you can take artistic selfies or videos to your heart?ôs content ??and add filters and such after the fact too.
According to Instagram, this will be available for all generations of iPhone from the 6S to the X, as well as ?úselect Android devices.??Among Apple devices, only the iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X have an official portrait mode. For the others, it?ôs neat to see Instagram is giving you options beyond your phone?ôs usual capabilities.
That means Instagram is likely using a purely AI-based system for depth sensing ??this is how the Pixel camera achieves portrait mode on its selfie shooter (or when ported to other devices). For the phones that do have their own portrait mode, Instagram doesn?ôt specify whether it?ôs using AI only or combining the technologies. We?ôve contacted Instagram for more information.
In addition to Focus, Instagram is also rolling out Mentions to iOS users, which allows users to tag their friends by putting a sticker with their handle on it in the picture. While IG has had text mentions for a while, this is infinitely more fun to look at. Also, if this feature sounds familiar, it?ôs because Snapchat debuted a similar feature last week.

Still, some videos continue to appear with spoofed ?úx ??Hacked by Prosox & Shade Fuck Illuminati??titles.

107,apps,"As someone who struggles with personal organization, I often find myself experimenting with new to-do apps and productivity tools, in order to cure my scatterbrained ways. The latest app I?ôve tested is Taskade, from the company of the same name.
Taskade?ôs biggest strength is that it doesn?ôt do too much. It lets you effortlessly group your to-do lists into folders, allowing you to segment your business and personal duties.
So, you could have a folder for work, and in that would be lists of tasks that you?ôve got to complete for projects you?ôre working on. Then you could have a folder for personal stuff, with lists for social groups that you?ôre in, and household duties that need to be done.

What sets Taskade apart from its larger rivals (and there are many, from fully-fledged productivity tools like Zenkit and Trello, to other to-do list apps like Todoist) is the attention paid to aesthetics. With pastel colors, emoji galore, and a really simplified user interface, you quite easily forget you?ôre using a work tool.
Well, no. That?ôs not quite true. But it does look really nice. You can highlight tasks with gorgeous pastel colors, and personalize how lists look.
According to Android Police, the company is also looking at introducing premium themes and stickers. I can?ôt see myself using that, but to each to their own.
Another strength of Taskade is that it comes with some pretty solid collaborative features, whilst not exactly overdoing it. It?ôs less concerned with feature-completeness, and focuses instead on ease-of-use.
For example, if I want to share a list with a friend, Taskade lets me copy a link and share it via my medium of choice ??like Whatsapp or Facebook Messenger. And instead of dealing with granular permissions, Taskade gives me two options: a view link, or an edit link.

There?ôs also a rudimentary chat feature, allowing you to discuss your workload with a colleague or friend.
Suffice to say, I?ôve very quickly become a fan of Taskade. While I?ôm still pretty evangelistic about Zenkit (the ability to transform a Kanban board into a to-do list is pretty bonkers, IMO, but so useful), I can definitely see myself using this beyond the review.
You can download Taskade on Android and iOS. A web version is available, too. At the moment, the service is entirely free, with a paid premium version on the horizion.

The app is slated to be updated with an option for parents to choose between handpicked videos, and those suggested by YouTube?ôs algorithms. It should become available in the coming weeks.
That should help prevent your children from stumbling upon videos of beloved cartoon characters being tortured, and of conspiracy theories about Freemasons sacrificing humans.

109,apps,"Earlier today, TechCrunch broke the news that Facebook had wiped messages Mark Zuckerberg and other executives had sent on Messenger. While Facebook said deleting messages from top management was a security issue, it felt kind of shady, especially considering the company recently admitted its automated systems could scan user messages (again, supposedly for altruistic reasons).
Deleting messages is also not a privilege everyone has ??but it may soon be.
Facebook now says it will allow anyone to unsend messages within the next few months. In a statement to several publications, the company said:
We have discussed this feature several times. And people using our secret message feature in the encrypted version of Messenger have the ability to set a timer ??and have their messages automatically deleted. We will now be making a broader delete message feature available. This may take some time. And until this feature is ready, we will no longer be deleting any executives??messages. We should have done this sooner ??and we?ôre sorry that we did not.
The statement mentions the existing ?òsecret message??tool that allows users to send encrypted, self-destructing message. But that feature is relatively buried, and I?ôve never seen anyone using it.
As it stands, your messages are stored on the recipient?ôs account even if you delete them from your own. This new feature would theoretically erase a message permanently from everyone?ôs devices ??as well as Facebook?ôs servers.
Allowing users to unsend messages would certainly be a welcome move towards giving every user a right to privacy, and allow users some piece of mind should they choose to stop using Facebook?ôs services.
For what it?ôs worth, WhatsApp recently implemented an unsend feature, but it?ôs only effective for one hour (and it was only seven minutes at launch). Given the current hubbub, it seems Messenger?ôs unsend button will be able to reach further back.
On the other hand, that could pose trouble for law enforcement, who would lose an important source of evidence. Imagine you want to report harassment, only to find out the culprit deleted their messages and you no longer have any proof. There are ways around this ??Facebook could temporarily store messages before deleting them permanently ??but we won?ôt know until the feature become more concrete.
Still, it?ôs step forward. It?ôs a shame the announcement is reactionary, but it?ôs better late than never.

In all fairness, there is nothing wrong with seeking to implement new ways for users to interact ??especially ones that have proved popular on competing platforms like Instagram and Twitter.

112,apps,"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg today revealed that all of its 2.2 billion users should assume their public data has been compromised by third-party scrapers.
The source of this vulnerability is Facebook?ôs search function, which allows anyone to look up users via their email address or phone numbers. Users have to opt into it, via an option that lets their names come up in searches. The security settings have this option on by default.
In a blog post from CTO Mike Schroepfer, Facebook hinted at the scope of the problem:
However, malicious actors have also abused these features to scrape public profile information by submitting phone numbers or email addresses they already have through search and account recovery. Given the scale and sophistication of the activity we?ôve seen, we believe most people on Facebook could have had their public profile scraped in this way.
During a call today with members of the press, Zuckerberg confirmed just how open Facebook had left its users:
I would assume if you had that setting turned on that someone at some point has access to your public information in some way.
Zuckerberg clarified, when asked about the 87 million number cited earlier, that it was the number of users potentially affected by Cambridge Analytica. Zuckerberg said he was confident that was the maximum number.
During the call today, Zuckerberg said he felt responsible for the missteps of his company, and that he hoped to learn from them moving forward. When asked if he still considered himself the best person to run the company, he said, ?úYes.??

CTO Mike Schroepfer outlined the company?ôs intentions to protect users??information by taking a ?úhard look??at app permissions. One such measure he mentions is informing users whose data may have been accessed by Cambridge Analytica.
And then he drops the bomb:
In total, we believe the Facebook information of up to 87 million people ??mostly in the US ??may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica.
Considering the original reports from the New York Times set the number of exposed users at around 50 million, that?ôs a pretty big increase in numbers.
In response to this massive breach, Facebook is locking down all of its major APIs, including those for Events, Groups, and Pages. Schroepfer says any apps wishing to access data from any of these features will need approval from Facebook first. He also stated the site will no longer allow apps that request access to personal data such as religious background, education, and work history.
Given the new scale of the Cambridge Analytica breach, Facebook?ôs essentially coming back around after the horses have fled in order to lock down an empty barn. Maybe these steps should have been taken before the data of a whopping 87 million people was compromised.

While the initial purpose of the update appears to be giving users context for the news stories they read. But the update also has a hidden second purpose: Showing you which of your friends are sharing bogus news stories.

The new update, first tested last year, gives users more context for news posts. By tapping on the ?úi??icon next to the story?ôs headline, you?ôll be shown the source?ôs Wikipedia article, related articles, and a map showing where the story has been shared before ??and by whom. That means, if you come across a story whose premise or politics you don?ôt agree with, you?ôll be able to see which of your friends has already shared it.
The former information tidbits are pretty standard ??having access to a non-Facebook summary of a news source?ôs history and a list of their recent articles is a good way of gauging not their popularity and views, if not reliability. But a hidden upside ??or downside, depending on your perspective ??might be seeing what kinds of news your friends are sharing.
Probably some of you already have your entire friends list pegged for their viewpoints, and you already know which of your friends are going to be getting the temporary mute during the next election. But for those of you with big friends lists, who might not already know, you?ôll be able to see what they have been sharing and where it comes from.
Of course, this doesn?ôt take into account why your friends might have shared a story from a particular site ??perhaps some of them included the link merely to comment on the contents without endorsing its viewpoint. But that?ôll require more research on the part of the user than Facebook.
According to Facebook?ôs developers, the original idea came from the ?úRelated Articles??you can find under news stories on your feed. In order for this to work, the authors of the stories have to have author tags implemented on their page.

There is one caveat for HD video enthusiasts:according to Facebook, you can only send and receive videos in 720p. For those of you used to 1080p goodness, you may be in for a disappointment.

117,apps,
118,apps,"I have a pet peeve. In the past couple of years, it?ôs become increasingly common for apps to use built-in browsers rather than directing you to Chrome, Safari, or your browser of choice when you open a link. This is annoying at best, and counterproductive at worst ??and it should stop being the default behavior for most apps that do so.
Note: This largely applies to both Android and iOS, but since I use Android 99% of the time, that?ôs the perspective I?ôm writing from.
I do a lot of work on my phone. I research pages, draft articles, compose emails, send messages, whathaveyou. Half of that work happens in a browser (Chrome), the other within apps.
When the two start to mix, things get messy.
Google itself is one of the worst offenders. Say I?ôm reading through my Gmail inbox, or searching for something on the Google app. The default behavior for both of these apps is to open links in a browser built into the app.
In this case, it?ôs technically a Chrome Custom Tab, which carries over many of Chrome?ôs features and lets you switch over to that browser quickly if you need to. Google actually created Custom Tabs to improve on the even-worse WebViews apps used to use ??and sometimes still do (more on this later).
It was a welcome improvement. But I still think it?ôs more annoying than simply, you know, opening the link in Chrome.
For reference, Chrome Custom Tabs look something like this:

It?ôs all fine and dandy if I only ever open a link for a quick, one-stop perusal. But often, opening a link means I?ôll be doing further research, or at least spend some time browsing. If someone sends me a Wikipedia article, for instance, chances are it?ôs going to send me down a tab-tastic research rabbit hole.
Problem is, you can?ôt open multiple tabs within an in-app browser. You can?ôt type in a new URL either. You can?ôt go back and to read another email without losing your place or any information you?ôve filled out. The same goes if you accidentally close the site.
If you want to do anything other than the most basic browsing, you?ôll have to tap the menu button and then ?òOpen in Chrome,??which adds two unnecessary taps. Thankfully, most apps let you disable the feature altogether (it?ôs usually buried somewhere in the settings).
It gets worse in apps like Facebook, which don?ôt use Chrome Custom Tabs, but instead implement their own WebView interface. Your bookmarks won?ôt carry over to your browsers. Your login information isn?ôt saved on websites. You miss out on common features like ?òfind in page??or ?òopen desktop site.??And sometimes web pages don?ôt even load properly.
Theoretically, in-app browsers are supposed to smooth the transition between app and web. Chrome Custom Tabs, for example, allow you to theme the browser to your app (see the bright red in the Gmail example), and are supposed to reduce load times by allowing apps to pre-start Chrome and pre-fetch content.
But I?ôve certainly never noticed a significant difference in speed, and again, I usually end up opening the tabs in Chrome anyway. After all, very few apps use in-app browsers on PCs, and they get by just fine.
Sometime?ôs it?ôs not so bad. Twitter?ôs mobile app, for example, uses Chrome Custom Tabs, but lets you tweet directly from where the URL bar would be in a browser. I never use it and would still argue against it, but it adds some functionality you won?ôt get in Chrome. And other apps only use built-in browsers to access their own domains, such as for support documentation, or to help enable logins or payment information. That?ôs fine.
But more often than not, in-app browsers are simply there to keep you from leaving. Roughly speaking, the more time you spend in an app, the more money its developers can make, especially when ad views are at stake. I just caution developers to consider whether spending the time to code an in-app browser is really enhancing the user experience or simply adding more clutter.

119,apps,"A popular gay hookup app has come under fire for sharing highly-sensitive user details with third-party companies. Used by more than 3.6 million men daily, Grindr has been handing over its users??HIV status to at least two other companies, according to a report by BuzzFeed News.
The app, which aims to facilitate safe hookups in the gay community, gives users the option to display their HIV status ??including their ?úlast tested date????on a public profile as a means of active disclosure.
This information is then shared with two companies: Apptimize and Localytics. Both, as best we can tell, are testing firms meant to optimize the user experience inside mobile apps. TNW has reached out to Apptimize and Localytics for clarification. Neither were able to comment as of this writing.
Here?ôs the rub. Because users??HIV status is just one data point of a much larger package ??including GPS position, email, age, height, weight, ethnicity, phone number, etc. (see the full list here) ??it?ôs possible for motivated individuals to piece together a fairly comprehensive look at individual Grindr users.
?úThe HIV status is linked to all the other information. That?ôs the main issue,??Antoine Pultier, the Norwegian researcher who uncovered the issue told BuzzFeed. ?úI think this is the incompetence of some developers that just send everything, including HIV status.??
Worse, the data ??including HIV status ??is sometimes shared in non-encrypted plain text, leaving it highly susceptible to online hacks and data breaches.
In a statement to Axios, Localytics essentially shifted the blame back to Grindr, saying it wasn?ôt necessary to provide this level of personal information to make use of its platform.

Grindr is unique in that it?ôs one of the few dating apps to encourage disclosing sexually transmitted infections on a public profile. To then share that data with multiple third-parties without explicitly notifying its users is an egregious breach of trust and privacy.
TNW was unable to reach Grindr for comment.
Update 4/3/2018 10:49am PST
Grindr CTO Scott Chen had this to say in a statement:
As a company that serves the LGBTQ community, we understand the sensitivities around HIV status disclosure. Our goal is and always has been to support the health and safety of our users worldwide.
Recently, Grindr?ôs industry standard use of third party partners including Apptimize and Localytics, two highly-regarded software vendors, to test and validate the way we roll out our platform has drawn concern over the way we share user data.
In an effort to clear any misinformation we feel it necessary to state:
Grindr has never, nor will we ever sell personally identifiable user information ??especially information regarding HIV status or last test date ??to third parties or advertisers.  
As an industry standard practice, Grindr does work with highly-regarded vendors to test and optimize how we roll out our platform. These vendors are under strict contractual terms that provide for the highest level of confidentiality, data security, and user privacy.
When working with these platforms, we restrict information shared except as necessary or appropriate. Sometimes this data may include location data or data from HIV status fields as these are features within Grindr, however, this information is always transmitted securely with encryption, and there are data retention policies in place to further protect our users??privacy from disclosure.
It?ôs important to remember that Grindr is a public forum. We give users the option to post information about themselves including HIV status and last test date, and we make it clear in our privacy policy that if you chose to include this information in your profile, the information will also become public. As a result, you should carefully consider what information to include in your profile.
As an industry leader and champion for the LGBTQ community, Grindr, recognizes that a person?ôs HIV status can be highly stigmatized but after consulting several international health organizations and our Grindr For Equality team, Grindr determined with community feedback it would be beneficial for the health and well-being of our community to give users the option to publish, at their discretion, the user?ôs HIV Status and their Last Tested Date.

If you want more control, and to ensure that you never have an open tab taking over your speakers, you?ôll want to try AutoMute.
This handy extension simply mutes all tabs by default, so you won?ôt hear a peep out of Chrome under any circumstances. Of course, you can tweak its functionality by hopping into its options menu and setting it to run in whitelist mode (all sites are muted except the ones you specify), or blacklist mode (all sites play sound except the ones you specify).
If you find yourself visiting a wide range of sites at work like I do (it?ôs all for research, obviously), you?ôll inevitably come across a few that include autoplay video and distract you with audio. With AutoMute, you don?ôt have to worry about them starting up unexpectedly. I like to use the whitelist mode to mute everything except YouTube (the extension button lets you add entire domains to your whitelist with just a click).
Just remember that with AutoMute installed, you?ôll no longer be able to unmute a tab by right-clicking on it; you?ôll have to click on the option in the extension button?ôs menu instead.

121,apps,"Twitter today introduced Timestamps, which allows users to share both live videos and recorded ones from a certain point. It?ôs essentially the same as the timestamp option on YouTube?ôs share button. Timestamps roll out today for the iOS and Android apps, as well as Periscope.
According to Twitter, it implemented this feature in response to users??frequently tweeting a whole video with a number indicating where in the video they wanted the viewers to start. Now anyone who views a tweet will see the video starting from the timestamp selected.
Timestamps help improve the conversation around news, as it allows people to cut directly to the parts of the footage most relevant. It makes sharing thoughts and ideas easier and more fluid than it has been on Twitter to this point.
For example, if I wanted to talk about a memorable quote from a speech broadcast on Twitter before now, I?ôd have to link to a video and give the appropriate start time. Now I can just link to the part of the video where the speech begins.
Twitter has embraced video over the past several months, incorporating it into the site?ôs breaking news coverage and brokering deals with major sports networks. You?ôre now just as likely, if not more, to see on-the-spot live news coverage on Twitter as you are on Facebook, as news networks now post hundreds of videos to Twitter every week.
Up to this point, Twitter?ôs primary rival for social media video space was Facebook. But with the introduction of Timestamps, Twitter has given itself an edge that Facebook won?ôt be able to duplicate. Even if Facebook introduced timestamps of its own, it doesn?ôt have the same scope that Twitter does, for all its Live video features.
Twitter?ôs timestamps are an ingenious way to start discussions about live broadcasting and coverage. Any attempt Facebook makes to bolster its Live video streams aren?ôt going to be as useful.

Now, Apple is adding a feature to its devices to assure users it won?ôt use data without their permission. More specifically, it?ôll try to do so transparently, rather than catching users off guard or sneaking details inthe  Terms of Service than nobody actually reads.
iOS 11.3 and macOS 10.13.5 include a new privacy icon that will show up any time ?úan Apple feature asks to use your personal information.??The icon, which looks like two blue people shaking hands, is there to alert users when an app calls for access your personal details, and will provide users with specific information on how their data is being used.
According to Engadget, Apple has been working on the feature for some time in response to the EU?ôs General Data Protection Regulation, which kicks off on May 25. So no, Apple isn?ôt just pushing the feature to avoid Facebook?ôs mistakes, but it certainly can?ôt hurt.
One of the biggest problems surrounding data privacy is unethical design. Apps usually technically tell you their data is being used in some tiny text in the ToS or a quick pop up you click past. Having an overt visual telling you your data is being used is a small gesture, but one that can have a significant positive impact on transparency. And starting in May ??in compliance with GDPR, Apple will allow you to download and correct the data it has on you ??or delete the information entirely.
Hopefully app designers themselves will follow suit. Data collection is an important part of improving software, but so is an honest conversation with users on how that data is being used.

That?ôs not all: Lifehacker has spotted Chatwatch, a new iOS app that uses WhatsApp?ôs public online/offline status feature to tell users how often their friends check the app, and estimate when they go to bed each day; it can even correlate data on two contacts you choose to guess if they?ôve been talking to each other.
Yeah, there?ôs no need to give anyone that sort of ammo. I prefer to maintain a low profile on messaging services so I can chat and respond on my own terms, so it?ôs rather alarming to know that my contacts can keep tabs on me this way.
The company says there?ôs not a whole lot you can do about it: even if you?ôve disabled the ?òLast Seen??feature in your account settings, it?ôll still be able to figure out your WhatsApp activity. We?ôre presently testing it and haven?ôt yet seen results, as Chatwatch generally requires 24 hours before it can generate certain insights.
But the first feature ??revealing how often your friends check WhatsApp ??seems plausible, because, as we learned with a quick trial with a few phones, it?ôs possible to find out if a WhatsApp user is online or not simply by initiating a conversation with them (no messages need to be exchanged for this to work). So it?ôs possible that Chatwatch?ôs system is automating this process of checking on users and aggregating data to deliver insights.
Naturally, it?ôd be great to see WhatsApp disable this functionality so we can maintain at least a semblance of privacy in our lives. For now, you?ôll have to hope and pray that your contacts are too stingy to shell out the minimum subscription fee of $2 (to spy on any two numbers for a week) to keep an eye on you.

Users who are part of the test can leave comments on any post on a public Page that can only be seen by those who fall within their privacy settings. At the moment, Page owners can?ôt see the private comments, though Facebook will implement a tool which will allow them to later.
Credit: Facebook
Not only would this give users space to have their conversations without having to start a public discussion, it offers an easier way of engaging your friends with a post or link than currently exists.
According to Tiffany Dohzen, Facebook?ôs News Feed product manager:
People have told us they prefer talking to their friends about public content as opposed to strangers. This new feature makes it easier for friends to connect, giving them a dedicated space to have conversations on public Page content.
Facebook users currently have multiple options for starting conversations with their friends over links or posts. There?ôs always the option to share the post to a person, or to message it to them directly. But both of those options are relatively labor-intensive, at least compared with just leaving a comment.
How many times have you scrolled through the comments section of a Facebook post and seen nothing but comments from people tagging their friends and family by name, simply because it?ôs an easier way of calling their attention to something than sharing it directly? Be honest: how many of you have left comments like that? (Guilty here, so no judgment intended.)
At the moment, the test is confined to a small number of users. If it does roll out globally though, it could help fulfill Mark Zuckerberg?ôs promise in January to bring people closer to their friends and family.

If you?ôre still keen on using Facebook, though, you might want to access it through Mozilla?ôs Firefox browser, with the organization?ôs new extension in tow.
The Facebook Container extension essentially isolates your identity on the social network from other sites that use third-party cookies. That means that if you?ôve logged into Facebook and then visited a separate site, the company won?ôt be able to track your web activity and associate it with your profile.
So, for example, Facebook won?ôt be able to tell which site you enjoy browsing for news, just because you clicked on a link or opened up the news site in a separate tab; if the site uses cookies and you didn?ôt have the extension installed, Facebook would be able to build up a profile about you which includes your preference for this news site.

Once you?ôve got the extension installed, it?ôll first delete all your Facebook cookies in Firefox. The next time you visit the social network?ôs site, it?ôll load in a blue-colored tab (which means you?ôre browsing in a container) and function as normal ??except that if you navigate to a non-Facebook site, that page will load outside of the container.
It?ôs worth noting that sites which require a Facebook account for registering or logging in may not work properly because of the extension; the same goes for embedded Facebook comments on articles. But if you value the privacy of your data, that?ôs a small price to pay.
Of course, this isn?ôt going to stop Facebook from collecting or selling data about you through its site and from other sources where it?ôs connected to your account ??but it?ôs a great start towards regaining control over your data.
The extension is available for Firefox on this page; if you?ôre wondering about switching to Firefox from Chrome, we?ôve got you covered with a handy guide to help you move in just two minutes.

If you want to know the essential details and how it effects you, read Bryan?ôs breakdown.
In response, the hashtag #deletefacebook has started trending on Twitter. Musk originally joined the conversation with a snarky response to WhatsApp founder Brian Acton:
What?ôs Facebook?
??Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 23, 2018

After that, multiple users justifiably asked him why he was allowing Facebook pages for his companies to remain up. In response, he pleaded ignorance of their existence ??though I?ôm pretty sure he?ôs got staff that handle that stuff for both companies.
I didn?ôt realize there was one. Will do.
??Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 23, 2018

Then he apparently followed through, as the SpaceX and Tesla pages on Facebook no longer appear to be there.
He declined to delete his Instagram, though. When asked, he said he believed it was independent enough to be ?úprobably ok.??It should be noted Musk is far more active on Instagram than he ever was on Facebook.
During all this, Mashable reporter Kerry Flynn brought up an issue between Musk and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg ??namely that a SpaceX rocket once destroyed a Facebook satellite.
Yeah, my fault for being an idiot. We did give them a free launch to make up for it and I think they had some insurance.

The two have also clashed in a more passive aggressive manner, when Zuckerberg was asked about Musk?ôs reservations about AI and responded by calling him a naysayer. Musk responded by saying Zuckerberg?ôs understanding of AI was ?úlimited.??
It?ôs possible the pages will eventually be reinstated, if this current scandal ever blows over. If not, they?ôll be the most high-profile casualty of the #deletefacebook movement thus far.

Instagram officially switched from a chronological feed to an algorithmic one back in 2016, and to say people were angry would be a bit of an understatement. Not only did it mean you were being fed a timeline that Instagram decided on, it meant you might also miss updates from people because Instagram chose to move them down.
There have long been calls for Instagram to bring back a chronological feed, or at least give you the option to switch between them as Facebook does ??there was even a Change.org petition with 26,000 signatures at the time of this writing.
It appears Instagram might finally have listened:
Based on your feedback, we?ôre also making changes to ensure that newer posts are more likely to appear first in feed. With these changes, your feed will feel more fresh, and you won?ôt miss the moments you care about.
That?ôs not quite the same as giving users the option to switch to a wholly chronological feed, but at least you probably won?ôt be seeing 6-day-old posts at the top of your feed just because you haven?ôt checked the app in a while.

You can check if your team is on either of those plans by visiting https://YourTeamNameHere.slack.com/account/team, and scrolling to the bottom of the page.
But don?ôt assume that you?ôre safe if your organization uses a free or Standard plan; administrators can request access to the data export tool by providing Slack with either valid legal process, consent of team members, or a requirement or right under applicable laws. Alternatively, they can use whitelisted apps that do the same thing; you can look up the apps connected to your team?ôs Slack by visiting https://YourTeamNameHere.slack.com/apps/manage, but it could take a while to figure out if any of those are designed to export data from private channels.

One museum in San Francisco, the de Young Fine Arts Museum, instituted photo-free hours during a recent exhibit. According to TIME, this was a compromise for those who wanted to take photos of the exhibit, and those who felt the clusters of amateur photographers were ruining the scenery. The rules apparently ended when the short-term exhibit did.
The rules served a particular purpose, preventing bottlenecks on the museum floor and ensuring everyone had a good chance to see the exhibit. While that might work for the museum ??and it?ôll work for other museums as well ??it?ôs not a viable long-term solution for any other popular targets of ?òGrammers.
It?ôs almost becoming passe to say that Instagram is ruining something. It?ôs ruining travel because people are choosing places for their photo-ready appeal rather than for comfort or interest. It?ôs ruining nature because it causes a huge influx of people to previously undisturbed spots. It?ôs ruining food because appearance is trumping taste.
In all those cases, the people affected are the ones who don?ôt have a photographic agenda.

137,apps,"Twitter and Facebook are evolving their approach to news, and have started to become the opposite of their former selves. Where Facebook is trying to shed its association with news, Twitter is building it into its platform ??but it?ôll need to avoid Facebook?ôs problems with fake news.
Facebook, whether it likes it or not, has become a source of news for many. A 2017 Pew study revealed that Facebook was far and away the site people are most likely to turn to when they want news, at least among its social media peers.
Meanwhile, Twitter has emerged as Facebook?ôs main competitor. In recent months, it?ôs has been beefing up its approach to breaking news. First, it collaborated with local news sources to improve authenticity of breaking news. The first instance of this was during the Parkland school shooting in February.
More recently, it?ôs working on a feature to pin breaking news to the top of its timeline, and curate a series of tweets both from news sources and Twitter users. Twitter first tested the feature during the death of Stephen Hawking, and confirmed it was making this a regular thing.
Facebook has dithered over what to do with news on its site. In January, it announced that it would no longer prioritize news posts over those of friends. Facebook has continuously insisted that it?ôs not a news site, and has done everything it can to disassociate itself from the label of news provider. It even tested a second News Feed specifically for Pages and publishers which it has since put on the backburner.
So what could Twitter learn from the difficulties that have pushed Facebook away from news?
Facebook?ôs main difficulty at the moment is the spread of fake news, a difficulty Twitter isn?ôt immune to. Twitter?ôs primary problem seems to be bot accounts, of which there are millions. Twitter has already assured its investors it?ôs committed to purging bot accounts, which would go part of the way towards keeping the news channels clear.
If Twitter is going to place more stock in news, it can benefit from keeping that news hand-selected and curated. According to Buzzfeed, Twitter will switch to algorithmic curation in the future. While that?ôll no doubt save the employees some time, having human eyes oversee breaking news will help keep fake reports down.
If any social media site is going to take Facebook?ôs crown as the place people go to for news, it?ôll have to avoid the mistakes that got Facebook such a questionable reputation.

For those out of the loop, PUBG is a third-person multiplayer shooter that sees you dropped from a plane onto an island with 99 others; to win, you have to be the last person standing at the end of the round. The island is vast, so you may not encounter other players for a bit when you first land there. However, you?ôll find yourself forced to move in to a smaller area on the map as the playable region becomes smaller and smaller over time ??leading to more frequent encounters and bloody action.

You can play solo, with a friend, or in a squad of four that sticks together for as long as possible. During each round, you?ôll want to pick up armor, weapons, and other items that can help you stay alive, as well as vehicles that will give you an advantage as you traverse the island. As with most free mobile games, there are in-app purchases to unlock cosmetic items like clothing.
In my brief spell with the game on a OnePlus 5T, I found it to be quite similar to the PC version in terms of graphics and performance, as well as the size of the map and the overall experience.

139,apps,"Google today introduced Google Play Instant, a Play Store feature allowing gamers to play certain games on Android devices without downloading or installing them. This means you don?ôt have to clear precious storage space to try a new game.
Last year?ôs Android Instant Apps announcement was a game changer, but it didn?ôt feature any games. Now, in what appears to be a re-branding, Google Play Instant will feature apps and games.
Credit: Google
The feature, which is still in beta, is already active on Google?ôs Play Store. You can see a partial list of games supported here at the Instant Gameplay page. We?ôve found a couple others that have the option as well, here?ôs the full list so far:
Google lists Panda Pop as an instant title, but we weren?ôt able to confirm this on our devices at the time of writing.
We spoke with Google Play product managers Jonathan Karmel and Benjamin Frenkel who told us the company was working with several developers, including Zynga and Unity, to bring more games to the service throughout the year.
Our attention spans are already stretched to the limits with notifications, advertisements, and thousands of other ?úfree??offerings. Speeding up the process of trying a new game is a win for developers and players.
Karmle and Frenkel said Play Instant would help with one of the biggest problems developers face: user dropout. A significant number of people, even after starting an installation, never actually follow-through and play games they?ôve downloaded. This means developers are missing out on advertising revenue and players may be missing out on a game they?ôd enjoy.
The experiences vary from game to game and the Play Instant option doesn?ôt allow users to play the entire game. For example Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire shows off a quick battle that lasts a few seconds, while Bubble Witch 3 Saga features a few full levels. After trying a game users have the option to install the game or simply exit.
This feature should be standard operating procedure for developers in the future. We tested it on a few different Android devices and it worked flawlessly for each of the above-listed games. With broader adoption it?ôs easy to imagine the Instant Gameplay section of the Play Store being the first place gamers look for new games to try out.

140,apps,"Facebook has quietly launched an Android app for its Express Wi-Fi initiative, which lets users log on to public Wi-Fi networks hosted by local partners, for a nominal fee.
The company began testing the service in India back in 2015, and rolled it out across 700 hotspots there last May, and it also became available in four other countries thereafter. The new app works in Indonesia and Kenya, notes TechCrunch. Oddly enough, it?ôs not available to me in India, even though the app supports Indian languages and its screenshots mention locations in the country.

While Express Wi-Fi?ôs service has been around for a bit, the app simplifies things by displaying a map of hotspots near you, and streamlines the process of getting you connected to the internet.
Express Wi-Fi is one of a handful of Facebook?ôs programs to bring more people in developing countries online, because that?ôs where its next billion users are. The company previously launched Free Basics, which offers mobile access to select sites on its platform at no charge ??but it was widely panned for violating net neutrality principles, and even found itself banned in India. It?ôs still available in 63 other countries around the world.
The social network is also testing drones that can circle remote regions for up to 90 days at a time and beam internet access from the sky, and also open-sourced a hardware platform that would enable low-cost internet infrastructure without the need for expensive cabling.
Express Wi-Fi is now available on Google Play; let us know in the comments if you get a chance to try it out.

141,apps,"When you get deep enough into Reddit, you inevitably stumble across something you didn?ôt know existed ??or could exist. Case in point: r/shoplifting, an active subreddit where Redditors talk about exactly what the name suggests. At over 80,000 subscribers, it?ôs a relatively large community, and they aren?ôt shy about their intentions.
The subreddit?ôs raison d?ô√™tre is to talk about stealing stuff, ways of stealing stuff, and places to go where you may most easily steal stuff. They?ôre very careful to specify that they aren?ôt ?òfessing up to anything ??until they do, naturally.
Credit: Reddit
Here are Reddit?ôs content policy, regarding ?úunwelcome content??
While Reddit generally provides a lot of leeway in what content is acceptable, here are some guidelines for content that is not. Please keep in mind the spirit in which these were written, and know that looking for loopholes is a waste of time. Content is prohibited if it is illegal.
Also, the Reddit user agreement says, ?úYou may not use reddit to break the law.??I think the idea behind the subreddit is that talking about committing a crime is not a crime ??though some of the Redditors posting about their ?úhauls??sure don?ôt give the impression they?ôre just speculating.
In some parts of the world, encouraging someone to commit criminal acts is called ?úincitement,??and yes, it?ôs illegal.
One of the subreddit?ôs own rules prohibits moralizing. In their own words: ?úStealing is bad, we get it. Nothing else needs to be said about it, and we are alright with the morality of our actions.??The violation of that is a permanent ban from the subreddit. By comparison, the violation of the rule against scamming posts earns you only a seven-day ban.
To be clear, my confusion stems less from the fact that people occasionally talk about stealing, and more from the dissonance between Reddit?ôs hustle to ban fatshaming subreddits while allowing this one to exist for two years.

142,apps,"Digg announced today that it?ôs closing down its Reader app, which lets you follow RSS feeds from sites you love to get updates from them without having to visit each individually.
That?ôs a bummer for fans of the tool, which featured a minimalist design and enough features to keep most folks happy. If you?ôre one of them, you?ôll only be able to use Reader until March 26; it?ôs best to export your list of feeds from it before that date.
But what should you use instead? There are several great RSS readers on the web today, and if you?ôre used to Digg Reader?ôs fantastic low price of zero, you?ôll probably want a free alternative. Here are our favorites that won?ôt cost you a dime.

After Google Reader died some years ago, Feedly took up the mantle of the go-to RSS wrangler in town. Since then, it?ôs added a bunch of features for archiving, sharing, and discovering new content, and its interface is one of the best in the business.
Besides being able to access Feedly on desktop and mobile, you can also choose between four layouts to skim through the news as you like. Feeds can be organized into folders and posts can go up on cross-feed ?òboards??that you create; you can also filter content by listing keywords you don?ôt care to hear about.
I personally enjoy the title-only view that not only lets me see several headlines at a glance, but also shows a counter that indicates how popular each story is. You can also use keyboard shortcuts to get around quickly.
Feedly lets you add up to 100 feeds for free; unlocking unlimited sources, boards, additional sharing shortcuts, and power search will cost you $5.41 a month.

Inoreader lets you subscribe to unlimited sources for free, and doesn?ôt scrimp on niceties at that price. The clean and flexible interface offers several different layouts and themes to choose from, along with options to filter articles, beam them to your connected devices, and save them as PDFs. Plus, there are several options for keeping your reader organized, with multiple mark-as-read toggles, and tags. Not too shabby for an ad-supported service.
If you want to make them disappear, you can sign up for a paid plan at $1.25 a month or $15 a year, which makes Inoreader one of the cheapest RSS readers out there. That?ôll also net you a customizable dashboard, password-protected feeds, IFTTT integration, filters and article translations.

If you?ôre looking for something bare-bones and easy to get to grips with, Feeder?ôs worth a look. There aren?ôt very many settings to customize your layout, and the free tier just lets you add as many feeds as you like, back up your list of subscriptions, and access your content on desktop and mobile. You do get some pretty themes, though.
For $5 a month, Feeder will remove ads, let you customize filters, and deliver notifications and more frequent updates from your subscriptions. Honestly, the paid tier doesn?ôt seem worth its asking price, given the alternatives that are available at a similar cost ??but the free version should suit RSS first-timers just fine.
That?ôs our list ??did we skip your favorite RSS reader? Let us know which one you use, and why you love it, in the comments.

143,apps,"Two-factor authentication is a great way to protect your online accounts, but it can be a tad cumbersome: you need to have your phone handy so you can either receive a one-time password via SMS (which frequently fails me), or set up an app like Google Authenticator to generate codes offline.
The folks at New York-based startup TypingDNA have come up with a way to make that a lot easier, and it?ôs one of the most interesting ideas in biometrics I?ôve heard of in a while ??and it now works as a two-factor authentication tool right in your browser.
Essentially, its service recognizes your typing pattern, which the company tells TechCrunch is unique to each individual. TypingDNA measures how long it takes you to reach a key, and how long you keep the key pressed down; this pattern is then associated with a user?ôs account.
The extension has you type in your username and password (you?ôll need one for each computer you use), and log you in only if your typing pattern matches up to the original. That means that if someone else nabs your credentials, they still won?ôt be able to log into your account on that computer.
Once you?ôre logged in, you can set up 2FA for a variety of popular services with TypingDNA (over 1,000 sites are supported, including Gmail,Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Amazon, Dropbox, GitHub, and DigitalOcean), and the extension will surface the necessary codes when you need to access any of those sites ??no phone necessary.
To set up 2FA for a site, log into TypingDNA first, and then follow your chosen site?ôs instructions and opt to generate a QR code that you?ôd normally scan with your phone in Google Authenticator or Authy. Then, click the TypingDNA extension button and you?ôll be able to grab that QR code with one click.
From then on, clicking the TypingDNA button will display the 2FA codes you?ôll need to log in to your sites of choice ??and you can fill in the codes with a click, too.
I tried the extension myself and found it to work pretty well; even if I slowed down or misspelled my email address or password, it was still able to recognize me correctly. To spoof it, I tried switching from my mechanical keyboard to my laptop?ôs membrane keyboard, and deliberately took my time with each key. That left me locked out, even with the correct credentials.
You?ôre right to be skeptical, and it?ôll probably take a few weeks of use before one can say for certain that TypingDNA works well for them. If you aren?ôt convinced, you can try a demo here. The company also notes that your chances of being mistakenly rejected when you attempt to login will decrease as you use the extension more often.
For now, it seems like a compelling alternative to whipping out your phone every time you need to log in to a site securely. Grab the extension for Chrome (it?ôll also work in Opera after you first install this extension) from this page.

144,apps,"Trekkies everywhere, yIlop! Duolingo today releases its full Klingon language course, so you can now grunt and spit in the tongue Star Trek?òs famously warlike alien species.
The course, which was created by a team of team of volunteers, has been in development for years. The first announcement for it surfaced in 2015. The lead creator, Trekkie Felix Malmenbeck, says the newest Star Trek show spurred further interest in the language:
The Duolingo course should help lower that barrier to entry by giving people a simple way to get regular exercise with the language. I suspect that this will lead to an increased number of Star Trek fans continuing their studies of Klingon. It also helps that Star Trek: Discovery has taken the language very seriously, meaning that there is now a stronger connection between the show and the language.
He?ôs not wrong ??Discovery?òs dedication extends as far as providing subtitles in Klingon.
It?ôs not Duolingo?ôs first dabble in constructed language ??it already has a course in High Valyrian, which you may have heard in Game of Thrones.
Still, as far as fictional languages go, Klingon is one of the most widely studied and understood. It was created by linguist Marc Okrand, who has since written an opera in Klingon. There are multiple Klingon-to-English dictionaries (including one written by Okrand himself). There?ôs even a Klingon Language Institute in Pennsylvania that has been educating people on the subject for over twenty years (and which also offers courses in the language, albeit not free).
Since Duolingo is now introducing fictional languages to its courses, there are a number of other tongues they can teach us. Tolkien?ôs Elvish languages have been similarly dissected by avid readers, and I would memorize the heck out of a Sindarin or Quenya course. The Dothraki language from A Song of Ice and Fire would make a nice compliment to High Valyrian.
A Duolingo spokesperson said that no further fictional courses are in development, but a be??can dream, can?ôt she?
The Klingon course is currently available only on Duolingo?ôs website. It?ôll come to the iOS and Android apps at a later date.

Last night was different.
For the first time, HQ didn?ôt split its prize. Instead of stopping at 12 or 15 questions like usual, host Scott Rogowsky kept on going until there was just one winner, which happened at question 18. The $25,000 dollar pot went to a single winner, by the alias of maelkins1.
We found The 1! Congrats to maelkins1 for taking home $25,000 on HQ tonight. pic.twitter.com/Lpuv5Ap5qI

If no one answered the last question correctly, the pot would have rolled over to next Sunday, for a total of $50,000.
To be clear, for most games, HQ will still split pots, but having weekly games with single winners significantly ups the trivia ante. I typically play several times a week, but usually don?ôt take it very seriously. I haven?ôt won yet, and if I did, it would probably only be a few bucks that at would likely just be enough to buy me a couple of slices of pizza.
But $25,000 is serious moolah ??like, pay off your student loans moolah. Suddenly HQ Trivia went from a casual game you waste 15 minutes of your day on, to a potentially life-changing event. You didn?ôt even have to buy a scratch-off card.
The flip-side is that significantly higher earnings will almost certainly attract even more hackers trying to cheat the game. In fact, people are already unsure whether Mikey Elkins is even a real person.
Chances are HQ will need to further scrutinize winners as the game becomes more popular and the prizes larger. In the meantime, you can bet there?ôll be a lot more people aiming for the grand prize on Sunday nights.

No wonder I?ôm so taken by Studio Calavera?ôs gorgeous 2D take on the classic, which features beautiful pixel art, a hot new soundtrack, and challenging retro platformer gameplay.
Developed by a tiny team of three, MiniDoom 2 is a remake of the unofficial 2D game that brothers Felipe and Juan Carlos Porcel made a couple of years ago as part of a game programming course they taught. This version fleshes out the idea with 17 new levels that include tons of collectibles and secrets, as well as 14 weapons inspired by the entire catalog of Doom titles.

The free service requires you to install a Chrome extension and allow it to read your emails, so it can train its machine learning system to generate suggestions. Once you?ôve got it set up, it?ôll prompt you to choose from a range of sentences and phrases that it deems contextually relevant.

While EasyEmail does what it claims to, your mileage may vary. It worked fine with some simple messages, prompting me to choose from smart suggestions as I began typing new sentences, similar to how autocorrect works on your phone. For example, when replying to a message from Mark and starting with ?òHi,??it?ôd suggest going with ?òHey Mark,??and other similar intros. Similarly, continuing my response brought up suggestions like ?òSounds good,??and ?òHow about Monday???
However, EasyEmail also ocassionally prompted me to use sentences from previous email conversations that were completely irrelevant (including some blasts from the past, like a decade ago). I also couldn?ôt get the text expansion feature (which is called ?òhotkeys??here, and could be useful for quickly filling out commonly used bits of text, like your address) to work, and trying to launch it sometimes crashed my browser tab.
There?ôs also the question of privacy to contend with. EasyEmail says it only reads your messages to learn what sorts of responses it should suggest, and stores data that its machine learning system trains with on encrypted Amazon servers. Your data should be safe, but with this in mind, you may want to only use it for your personal inbox and not your sensitive work email.
So, it?ôs not perfect ??but for folks like me who frequently freeze up when writing emails, this is a handy tool to help get through one?ôs inbox.
EasyEmail presently works only with Gmail and G Suite inboxes, and support for Outlook is in the works. Give it a try by grabbing the extension from this page.

155,apps,"Surprise! Google today released the first Android P preview, well ahead of its full unveiling at Google I/O in May. The build is strictly meant for developers, but it already contains an interesting glimpse of what?ôs to come. You can read Google?ôs full blog post here, but we?ôve distilled some of the most interesting features coming in the next version of Android below:
We knew it was coming, but now it?ôs official: Android P includes official support for camera cutouts ??sometimes called notches ??as seen in the Essential PH-1 and iPhone X. There are already multiple phones on the way this year expected to arrive with a camera cut out, with many more surely on the way.

According to the documentation, developers will be able to automatically change the status bar height to accommodate the notch and avoid irksome letterboxing. Alternatively, if the app or some of its content works better in a full screen view, it can display around the notch as well. Developers will be able to simulate a notch on their notch-less devices to help make sure everything looks tidy when creating their apps.
Google doesn?ôt say it explicitly, but preview images already hint that Google is aiming for a major aesthetic overhaul with Android P ??just as rumored. For comparison, here?ôs what the notification shade looks like in stock Android O:

And here?ôs what it looks like in the Android P preview:

Android Police also points out that the time is now shown on the left side of the screen ??perhaps to be more symmetrical around notches ??and that the settings menu is now a lot more colorful.
That?ôs quite a shift ??Android P looks a lot more bubbly on the whole. It may not be final, but it still gives a taste of the new look Google is going for.
Speaking of the notification shade, Google has a few practical improvements in that area too.  Android P introduces support for more informative alerts from messaging apps.
As seen in the image above, you?ôll be able to see messages in the context of a conversation, send AI-powered smart replies, and view attached images right from the notification shade. Notifications are arguably the heart of the Android experience, so Google is constantly looking to evolve that part of the OS.
Plenty of Android phones come with multiple cameras, but in most cases, you need to use the pre-installed camera app to take advantage of them.
Android P includes native support for multiple cameras. That means you?ôll be able to use features like zoom, bokeh and even stereo vision (3D) within the camera sections of other apps like Snapchat or Instagram. Assuming, of course, that those apps add support.
Android P introduces support for the IEEE 802.11mc Wi-Fi protocol, also known as WiFi Round Trip Time (RTT).
What all those letters mean is that your Android device will help you navigate while within indoor locations ??where GPS normally can?ôt reach or isn?ôt precise enough. RTT is precise enough to pinpoint your location within 1 to 2 meters.

Finally, you?ôll be able to make your way through your maze-like local mall.
Android P includes native support for HDR VP9 Profile, which will make it easier to watch HDR movies for streaming sources on HDR-compatible devices.
Then there?ôs support for HEIF. If you?ôre not familiar, it?ôs the super-efficient image compression format Apple popularized with iOS 11 last year. It can compress images to less than half the size of a JPEG, while maintaining higher image quality.
With HEIF becoming increasingly popular, it could go a long way towards saving precious storage on mobile devices.
If you want to read more about Android P or install it on your own device, head on over to the Android Developers Blog. Keep in mind this build is only meant for developers; while public previews will arrive later in the year, you need to flash this one to your device manually. All that being said, Google typically saves the best new features for Google I/O. If you?ôre not a developer, you?ôd probably be better off waiting before you test drive Android P anyway.

Windows 10 S, if you don?ôt recall, is an optimized version of Windows meant for affordable and low-power devices.

In doing so, Microsoft can better guarantee smooth performance, long battery life, and quick start ups over extended periods of time.
But we all know about the scarcity of apps in the Windows Store, in particular for big names like Photoshop and Steam.  Even though I thought Windows 10 S was worth giving a chance, if you need to use Photoshop even once, you?ôd have to upgrade to a full version of Windows. And once you?ôd upgraded, you couldn?ôt go back.
With S-Mode, Microsoft seems to want to give users more flexibility. It seems you?ôll be able to activate S-Mode on existing systems, locking it down so it only runs apps from the Windows Store. I expect many systems will still come with S-Mode enabled by default, and you might still have to pay to unlock it the first time around, but it?ôs nice to have options.

157,apps,"Buckle up for the news of the century fam: Dictionary.com is upping its street cred with a bunch of new, funky-fresh slang definitions like ?òbasic bitch,???òcuck,??and ?òfuckboy.??
This means you no longer have to sit around like a chump when the cool kids start dropping modern terminology at parties, nam sayin?? Instead, you can whip out your phone and and consult Dictonary.com for some turnt words you can use to show you?ôre truly part of the gang.
?úAs time goes on, old words take on new meanings, new words are introduced, and new forms of communication, like emoji and memes, emerge,??said Dictionary.com CEO Liz McMillan.
?úOur products are meant to help users understand the many ways language is actually being used, so we consistently publish new additions, even when communication surpasses the traditional written word,??she continued. ?úWith this update, consumers now have access to comprehensive, accurate meanings and example sentences using the latest emoji and slang terms.??

Unlike popular crowdsourced alternative Urban Dictionary, Dictionary.com takes a more politically correct approach to explaining terms.
For instance, Urban Dictionary?ôs entry on ?òcuck??offers the following definition:
A man who is desperate for acceptance, approval, and affection from women. This desperation has led to the compromise of his beliefs and values, the desecration of his dignity and self-worth, and his inability to stand up for himself and what he deserves as a human being, eg. loyalty, fidelity, and honesty in a romantic relationship.
By contrast, here is how Dictionary.com has described the term:
A cuck is a derogatory slang term for a weak, effeminate, or inadequate man. Cuck has also been blended with conservative to produce cuckservative, often shortened back to cuck. Both cuck and cuckservative are especially used online by white nationalists to insult US Republican politicians they judge as insufficiently conservative.
In addition to the definition, Dictionary.com further provides some etymological background on the words, including how the phrases came to be, who uses them, and how they appear in everyday life.
Dictionary.com has also added definitions for several more terms, including ?òadulting??(or the quality of acting grown-up), ?òfuck up some commas??(or to spend recklessly), as well as ?òNetflix and chill??which most of you should be familiar with by now.
The company has similarly annotated some emoji as part of the update. You can browse through the emoji dictionary category here. For what it?ôs worth, Dictionary.com claims it is the first service to include such definitions ??as if this marketing stunt is some grand, novel idea.
For the record, this is hardly the first time Dictionary.com has updated its vocabulary. Indeed, American magazine Bustle broached the idea of adding ?òfuckboy??to Dictionary.com back in 2015.
More recently, the dictionary service made headlines after it quietly updated its app permissions so it could intrude on your privacy.
Anyone who wants to keep it real can get started with Dictionary.com?ôs full list of slangs here. It?ôs totally lit.

158,apps,"Google has added a messaging service to its Tez payments app, which allows users in India to send and receive money directly to their bank accounts, reports the Economic Times.
The feature is presently rolling out, and will soon become available to all 13.5 million users of the app. Google explained that the idea is to make it easy for people to track their transactions when they send or receive money from their contacts.
That makes sense for situations when you need to remind a friend to pay back what they owe you, or for folks to explain why they?ôre sending you a certain sum of money. Paytm, which offers a digital wallet among other services, recently baked messaging into its apps, and WhatsApp rolled out support for payments on its platform for users in India last month.
But it could also be part of a larger play for Google. The company recently updated Tez with the ability to surface bills from a number of utility service providers (like electricity, broadband and cable TV) and pay them off. By enabling messaging in its app, it could eventually allow businesses to send transactional messages as well as promotions right within Tez.
That could be similar to WhatsApp?ôs new app for businesses, which launched in January. The major benefit for companies that sign up to use this functionality is that they?ôll be able to talk to customers and receive payments from them seamlessly.
While the inclusion of messaging might initially sound like overkill for a payments app like Tez, it may soon be par for the course for users in India, who are increasingly going cashless. Since the grand demonetization exercise of November 2016, digital wallets and apps that use the country?ôs national Unified Payments Interface (UPI) for P2P transactions have soared ??and making such apps more flexible and usable in a wide range of scenarios seems to be the order of the day.

159,apps,"Instagram has been adding features at a relentless pace the last couple of years, but it doesn?ôt appear to be stopping any time soon. Recent explorations into the app?ôs code suggest Instagram is toying with several new features. There?ôs no timeline on when most of them would arrive, but they?ôre still worth keeping an eye out for.
As first reported by TechCrunch (via Ishan Agarwal) Instagram appears to be working on a portrait mode for the app. Decompiling the Android version?ôs code shows a file called ?úportrait_shutter_icon.png?? This button would replace the normal shutter button while shooting within the app?ôs portrait mode camera.
At first glance, this appears to be a sort of ?òuniversal??portait mode, independent of your device?ôs hardware. In theory, it should be able to create portraits using AI, even if your phone doesn?ôt have the typical hardware necessary.
Credit: TechCrunch
You might think a software-only portrait mode would lead to sucky images, but that?ôs not necessarily true. The Pixel 2, for instance, mostly uses AI for its single-camera portrait mode. Although the rear camera sensor has some mild depth-sensing capabilities, the front camera does not; the latter uses AI exclusively for portrait photos. Indeed, we?ôve already seen the Pixel 2?ôs camera tech ported to other phones without any specialized hardware.
All that being said, a more pedestrian explanation for the appearance of the portait button would simply be that Instagram is adding the ability to leverage your phone?ôs built-in portrait mode on compatible devices. But I consider that option less likely, as it might be more work  to ensure compatibility across the myriad of Android devices than to use a one-size-fits-all AI solution.
A month ago, WABetaInfo spotted a Cinemagraph feature in Instagram?ôs camera by using a method to unlock  hidden features in the app, and shared it with our social media guru Matt Navarra. There wasn?ôt a demo of the feature at work, and all we got was the one screenshot, so who knows if this will ever see the light of day.
NEW: Instagram is working on a ?òCinemagraph??feature for Stories 
(Screenshot: @WABetaInfo) pic.twitter.com/Y3r2zNta8N
??Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) February 6, 2018

For those not familiar, Cinemagraphs are something in between a still photo and an animation ??only a small portion of the image is in motion. It looks cool and is generally used to highlight the most interesting part of a scene.
WABetaInfo today reported Instagram is testing the ability to ?òstar??a chat, which marks it as a favorite and/or makes it easier to find. The star is located on the upper right hand corner of a conversation. It also appears you?ôll be able to star specific messages within a conversation for easy reference later.

In related news, Instagram will add search filters to direct messages. Right now, the app seems to have three filters: Inbox, Unread, and Starred.
With all our information stored in the cloud nowadays, sometimes it?ôs nice to have a hold of your own data. Instagram appears to be considering letting users download all their data from its servers. WhatsApp ??which like Instagram, is owned by Facebook ??is due to implement the feature as well.

The feature isn?ôt just good will on Instagram and WhatsApp?ôs part ??it?ôs a response to new regulation from the European Union called General Data Protection Regulation. The new laws become enforceable by May 25th of this year, so expect the feature to show up by then.
It stands to reason that Instagram is constantly testing new features, so there?ôs no guarantee when all of these will show up publicly, if ever. Still, we?ôve seen a significant portion of test features make their way to final versions of the app ??we?ôll be sure to report back if they ever see the light of day.

161,apps,"Google Lens is a handy little tool. Announced at Google I/O 2017, Lens is essentially a visual search engine. Take a picture with your phone, and Google will do some clever analysis and provide insights into what you?ôre looking at. Now, it?ôs getting even better, and can store information from business cards as contacts, and even describe landmarks you?ôve spotted.
Rolling out today, Android users can try Google Lens to do things like create a contact from a business card or get more info about a famous landmark. To start, make sure you have the latest version of the Google Photos app for Android: https://t.co/KCChxQG6Qm Coming soon to iOS pic.twitter.com/FmX1ipvN62
??Google Photos (@googlephotos) March 5, 2018

If you?ôve got a business card, just open a photo of it in Google Photos and navigate to Lens. With just a tap, Lens will automatically create a contact for you using the information printed on the card.
This is handy because it addresses the two things I really hate about business cards. Firstly, people at conferences eventually run out of them, meaning you?ôve got to write their contact details down on a slip of easily-losable paper. I always lose them. Always.

Secondly, it means you don?ôt actually have to take the card, because you?ôve already got the information stored electronically.
This is music to my ears. An unavoidable hazard of this job is that my apartment is littered with literally hundreds of business cards, which almost always show up in the most unexpected of places. You could describe business cards as the glitter of the working world.
(Side note, I wanted my Secret Santa to get me a Rolodex for Christmas, but he didn?ôt, possibly because it?ôs 2018 and nobody uses Rolodexes anymore.)
If you?ôve never used Google Lens before, and are worried about it being laggy or slow: don?ôt be. It?ôs blazingly fast. I tested this feature out on a mid-range Honor phone using cellular data. It took about five seconds from start to finish.
Anyway, I digress. The other cool new addition to Google Lens is the ability to identify and provide context to famous landmarks. So, if you?ôre in the Italian city of Pisa and you see a tower skewed at an awkward angle, Lens will tell you ?úHey! That?ôs the Leaning Tower of Pisa.??
And if you?ôre in Slough and you see??something??well??
Look, Lens will get back to you, okay? It doesn?ôt work miracles.
In addition to identifying buildings, Lens also gives you information you might need. This includes things like a description of the place, or its opening hours, thereby saving you a Google search.
The latest and greatest version of Google Lens is found in Google Photos. If you don?ôt have it, you can download it here.
If you have the app installed (which you probably will, as Google Photos comes pre-installed on most Android devices nowadays), but can?ôt find the feature, you might need to update it.
Sadly, iOS users will have to wait a bit to use this. Google announced a version of Lens for Apple?ôs smartphone platform at MWC 2018, but hasn?ôt given any concrete dates for when it might land. It said it?ôll drop ?úin the coming weeks.??
And I won?ôt make a joke about Windows phone because I did that yesterday.

162,apps,"Facebook got itself in blazing hot water today when a survey surfaced that appeared to ask users if they condone illicit correspondence between an adult male and a minor child. In response, the company said it was a ?úmistake??but danced around explaining why they asked the question in the first place.
The Guardian?òs Jonathan Haynes initially posted screenshots of the survey to Twitter, which showed both the questions and answers.
In thinking about an ideal world where you could set Facebook?ôs policies, how would you handle the following: a private message in which an adult man asks a 14 year old girl for sexual pictures.
If you think the question is bad, you should see the answers:
And asked this ??and I?ôm like, er wait it making it secret the best Facebook can offer here? Not, y?ôknow, calling the police? pic.twitter.com/t2UZuKalfk
??Jonathan Haynes (@JonathanHaynes) March 4, 2018

A follow-up question asks who users think should set the rules regarding such interaction, with two of the answers being ?úFacebook.??Even though, you know, that?ôs not up to Facebook. Call me a traditionalist, but I?ôm pretty sure lawmakers set the rules regarding inappropriate interactions between adults and children a long time ago.
And y?ôknow, shouldn?ôt laws figure here as being quite important on determining rules? pic.twitter.com/9fzdHNJos8
??Jonathan Haynes (@JonathanHaynes) March 4, 2018

Ordinarily, I might try to play devil?ôs advocate and posit a good reason for Facebook to even ask this question. But I racked my brain trying to come up with a theoretical reason and couldn?ôt come up with one, save maybe quarantining anyone who gave the first answer to the first question. I?ôd ask what the survey writers are smoking, but that seems like an insult to law-abiding smokers everywhere.
Facebook?ôs VP of Product, Guy Rosen, responded directly to Haynes??tweet, saying, ?úThat was a mistake.??(Understatement, perhaps.)
We run surveys to understand how the community thinks about how we set policies. But this kind of activity is and will always be completely unacceptable on FB. We regularly work with authorities if identified. It shouldn't have been part of this survey. That was a mistake.
??Guy Rosen (@guyro) March 4, 2018

The company issued a statement to The Guardian explaining the survey ??or at least, dance around explaining it:
We understand this survey refers to offensive content that is already prohibited on Facebook and that we have no intention of allowing so have stopped the survey. We have prohibited child grooming on Facebook since our earliest days; we have no intention of changing this and we regularly work with the police to ensure that anyone found acting in such a way is brought to justice.
I?ôm glad to hear Facebook isn?ôt going to change its policy on such things, but that still doesn?ôt answer the question of why this survey was created in the first place. Someone had to sit down and think up that question, then send it out to users, and I?ôm morbidly curious as to what, if anything, Facebook intended to do with the answers it collected.
We?ôve contacted Facebook to see if it could offer something, anything which would clarify this situation.

163,apps,"After having racked up millions of downloads across Android and iOS over the past couple of years, the mobile blockbuster title Alto?ôs Adventure got a sequel last month, in the form of a beautiful labor of love: Alto?ôs Odyssey.
Created by Team Alto ??a collaboration between UK-based artist Harry Nesbitt and Toronto, Canada-based studio Snowman ??the iOS title has received rave reviews and is topping the App Store charts across the globe.

While Alto?ôs Adventure saw the protagonist shepherd llamas as he snowboarded across mountain ranges to lilting tunes, the sequel has him and his friends sandboarding through the desert, discovering hidden temple cities and other mysteries. The gameplay feels instantly familiar to fans of the first title, while adding in new elements like wall-riding, bouncing on hot air balloons, and keeping lemurs at bay.
In bringing the simple fluid physics-based mechanics of their original zen-like endless runner to a whole new environ, the creators have pulled off the difficult task of following up their monumental debut. I got a chance to speak with Harry Nesbitt, lead artist and programmer, as well as Ryan Cash, founder and CEO at Snowman, and Eli Cymet, lead producer at the studio, to learn about how they nailed their sophomore effort.
Ryan Cash, founder and CEO at Snowman: It?ôs been like a whirlwind, really, and we?ôre happy with how the launch went. It was a bit different from when we launched Alto?ôs Adventure back in 2015, as that title was only available in English, French, Italian, German and Spanish initially; we added support for several more languages over the course of the past three years. With Alto?ôs Odyssey, we went live with all those languages on day one.
The US has been the biggest market for us this time around too, but now, Asia is huge as well. We made it to #9 on China?ôs paid apps list (in the App Store), and we hit #1 in India. I?ôd say that iOS device ownership and greater language support have both contributed to these differences in launch figures between the two games.

Following the massive initial success of Alto?ôs Adventure, the team released a major update that added a Zen Mode to the title in 2016, which removed obstacles to create a more relaxing experience for players who simply wanted to drift off into the game world. It was around that time that Cymet moved his family from Vancouver to Toronto to work more closely with the team at Snowman, and he said that the ordeal helped ?úgive me a sense of groundedness in this emotion we?ôve tried to capture with the game, of going outside your comfort zone and putting yourself somewhere completely new that?ôs beautiful and interesting, and trying to find the beauty there.??
Eli Cymet, lead producer: It?ôs an ongoing process even now. The starting point needed to be a feeling that we wanted to capture. For us as a development team, it?ôs important that everything in the Alto universe brings players into a space that feels transportive, like they?ôre a little far from home, and maybe someplace magical ??and that while they?ôre there, we stir a little bit of emotion in them.
The first step was for us to realize that Alto?ôs Adventure was a finished product. We decided at some point in late 2016, that if we were to continue with the series, we needed to stop tinkering with the current game. It was more difficult a decision to make than you might imagine.
Once we got past that, we began outlining what this project would be like, and how many team members we?ôd need to pull it off beyond just Harry. That?ôs how we ended up finding BAFTA-nominated programmer Joe Grainger based in the UK, who?ôs been unbelievable as a team member. Once we got the band together, it was about getting our infrastructure and our Slack channels set up so we could get down to work.
This time around, we had more people on the Snowman team to bounce ideas off of. We started this process shortly after Game Developers Conference in 2017 with an Alto jam, where we let our hair down a bit to see what sort of new ideas, mechanics and concepts we could come up with. A lot of that ended up on the cutting room floor, but from that, we found the core shape of Alto?ôs Odyssey, and the rest really was about building it out, keeping everyone on track and feeling supported as we inched towards completing the project.

Harry Nesbitt, lead artist and programmer: We stripped back everything from the game, and tried to find alternative features and mechanics that would stand on their own. With this new game, we were sure that we didn?ôt want to simply re-skin existing assets. We wanted to challenge ourselves to find stuff that has its own value, and I think that was a really important step in the process. That helped make us more conscious of what we are bringing back from the first game, and what we?ôre adding, so we could strike a balance between them.
Harry Nesbitt: Before the first game came out, we were talking about what it?ôd be like to have an Alto game set in the desert; it?ôd be sort of an antithetical setting where you could explore a different set of feelings and environments, and potentially mechanics that came from those. So it was an idea that felt very pure and logical.

As Eli mentioned, it wasn?ôt just about changing the colors for the second game, it was more like, ?òlet?ôs find this new space and explore everything it has to offer, and really try and be true to the feeling of stepping out of the familiar space from the first game,??while also feeling connected between the spaces so they?ôre from the same world. At the same time, there?ôs a whole different range of tones and themes that you can explore in Alto?ôs Odyssey.
Harry Nesbitt: I think so. When we were designing the original, there was an effort to reduce the visual complexity and create a game that was viscerally enjoyable to play.
We were inspired by a lot of other endless runners, but it felt like a lot of them were trying to overwhelm players in trying to create an exciting experience. A lot of folks loved that, and so did we to an extent. But we wanted to try going in a different direction, and so that led us to create a minimal experience.
Players were getting in touch to tell us this was great for relieving stress and coping with anxiety, and we had no idea that the game would have such a profound effect on them. So when we looked at this feedback, we said, how can we respond to this and consciously add a new game mode that takes this further? Can we remove all the extraneous meta-game stuff ??goals, points, tricks, and fail states? And so we came up with Zen mode. It was well received, and that was validation of the idea that there?ôs value in taking things out than adding things in needlessly.
It was an eye-opening moment (after that update): having a little restraint can go a long way, and we?ôve kept that in mind for this effort.
Eli Cymet: Brian Crawford did a phenomenal job with the score on the last one. This time around, with the growth of the Snowman team and being able to have more people who worked in the same place and time zone, we were fortunate to be able to get Todd Baker on board. He?ôs the audio designer and composer who worked on Tearaway and Monument Valley 2. For Alto?ôs Odyssey, we focused on elevating the soundscape and music of the game in ways that complemented the expanded world for Alto and his friends, and we were looking for creative ways to go about that.

That involved things like mirroring the game?ôs procedural generation with a soundtrack that wasn?ôt set in a standard time signature. So while the ear may detect this beautiful musicality to the score, you never really memorize it in a way that you?ôd know what?ôs coming around the bend.
Players constantly tell us about how they enjoy the way the music reacts to changes in the game. A little secret I can let you in on is that that?ôs not really happening. Todd just created such a dynamic and unpredictable score, along with working on changing up the way the music brings you into and out of the levels, that it never feels repetitive, but instead feels responsive.
We worked with Baker on the core soundscape, sound effects and the main theme; for the Zen Mode in this game, we brought back Torin Borrowdale, a film and TV composer based in LA, whose sound suited this part of Alto?ôs Odyssey.

Eli Cymet: As part of Team Alto, I love this idea that play on mobile devices has opened up gaming and play to a wider audience of people that don?ôt traditionally think of themselves as gamers or as people who?ôd invest in a gaming system.
I truly believe there?ôs something profound and personal in making play experiences for these devices that sit in your pocket all the time, that you?ôre deeply connected to. I?ôm very proud of the fact that we at Team Alto and at Snowman come from non-game-development backgrounds: we?ôre writers, illustrators, designers and marketers. I think these backgrounds lend themselves to appreciating the value in play that isn?ôt strictly expertise- or competence-driven. And I think there?ôs something really wonderful about making something that could be someone?ôs therapeutic and fun experience, or someone else?ôs first gaming experience.
We?ôre already receiving mail with photos of children getting their first taste of gaming with the Alto titles. As far as I?ôm concerned, I?ôll always push for games that are accessible, offer people a window into a magical place for some amount of time, and not dependent on their skill. And I think there?ôll be a small, if not constantly growing audience for that kind of thing.

Ryan Cash: Jordan Rosenberg (co-founder at Snowman) and I accidentally fell into making games. We grew up playing video games, but both of us stopped playing around our late teens. At the time, the world was a different place; saying that you want to make games was as crazy as saying you wanted to make it to the NBA. Of course, a lot has changed since then, and both the gaming market and industry are a lot bigger now, and it eventually made sense for us to enter this business.
For us at Snowman, we?ôre keen on working on things that are artistically fulfilling. An unspoken mantra we have at the company is that anything we work on here, we should be able to print a screenshot of it and have people enjoy it as art.
Eli Cymet: There?ôs a part of me that doesn?ôt actually believe that this game is really out. That?ôs perhaps a roundabout way of saying that we aren?ôt thinking way ahead just yet. We?ôre keen to release the Android version over the next few months.
We?ôre also focused on making the Alto?ôs Odyssey experience as polished as possible, so fixes and patches are the order of the day for now. We all feel that the Alto characters are a group of friends that we?ôve gotten to know over time. We feel responsible as good stewards of that universe, and we?ôre always going to have this itch to tell stories from there. As those stories become compelling enough to us that we can no longer wait to share them, we?ôll get to telling those stories as best as we can.

Unlike the previous version, the new format has much more defined borders and accentuates the older card-box view. It remains unclear how widespread the test is, but TNW staffers still see the older design.

165,apps,"University is really bloody expensive. In the UK, squeezed students are paying more than ever for tuition after fees were tripled in 2010 by David Cameron?ôs government. But you could be forgiven for thinking some students haven?ôt really noticed.
They skip lectures and contact hours they?ôve paid hundreds of pounds for. And when they do show up, they don?ôt spent the time looking at the lecturer, but rather their phones. They care more about Snapchat than seminars; more about Twitter than tutorials.
University students are adults. They can?ôt be told off or disciplined, but can they be bribed? That?ôs the idea behind one app, Hold, which has launched in the UK after a runaway success in Scandinavia.
The premise behind it is simple. Students install an app which monitors their phone?ôs activity. Every twenty minutes that passes without them instinctively looking at it, they get a point. And what do points make? Prizes. Get enough, and students can bag discounts and freebies from brands like Amazon, Vue, and Caffe Nero.
With cinema chain Vue, for example, students can get discounts on tickets. Earn enough points, and they can get free popcorn.
There?ôs also the option to donate points. Students using the app can exchange them for school books and stationary, which are then handed out by UNICEF to needy kids.
Hold makes money from deals with brands. Behind the gamified concentration angle, the app is essentially a marketing tool, allowing companies to directly vie for a chunk of the user?ôs student loan.
It?ôs an intriguing idea, and has a welcome philanthropic bent. But on a very fundamental level, isn?ôt its existence also kinda depressing? Have smartphones degraded our minds so much, we need to be rewarded for exercising a basic level of self-control? That?ôs the question I posed to Hold Founder, Maths Mathisen (no really, that?ôs his name).
?úA quick news search on the topic of phone addiction shows you that it is a huge issue experienced across generations and society as a whole. What is bad, is that students today face so many digital distractions, predominantly from their mobile phones, and we aim to be the remedy to many of these problems ??without having to physically take their phones out of their hands,??he said.
Mathisen added that students seem aware of this issue, and are willing to take steps to address it. ?úThe fact that a quarter of students in Norway downloaded Hold in just three months following launch shows that young people are ready to make that change,??he said.
The idea of positive reinforcement to enact behavioral change is nothing new. A parent might offer a child an allowance in exchange for performing a task, like keeping their room clean and tidy.
While it?ôs a little disheartening to see adults treated in the same way, I also completely recognize that technology (and the existence of permanently-connected, vibrating, beeping devices in our pockets) have fundamentally impacted our brains. The notion of an attention span feels almost antiquated now.
I know because while writing that paragraph, I entered the woods of social media, checking Twitter and switching on a song from Hamilton on YouTube. It?ôs an issue that?ôs universal to everyone, and not just college students.
The makers of Hold have plans to bring the app to the workplace and other tiers of education, but in the meantime are limiting it to university students. But if you?ôre a UK university and you want to check it out, you can do so here. Hold is available on Android, iOS, and Windows Phone.

167,apps,"The folks at San Francisco-based Automattic have a good reason to celebrate this Monday: its WordPress content management system (CMS) now powers 30 percent of all sites on the web.
That?ôs according to W3Techs, a service run by Austrian consulting firm Q-Success that surveys the top 10 million sites ranked on Alexa. Its numbers are updated daily, and today it sees WordPress accounting for 60 percent of the CMS market.
WordPress has been in the lead for a good while now, with rival systems like Joomla, Drupal, Magento, Shopify, Google?ôs Blogger, and Squarespace trailing by a huge margin (Joomla takes the #2 spot with 3 percent of sites). Of course, it?ôs worth noting that 50 percent of all sites are either built from scratch or utilize CMSes presently not monitored by W3Techs.
That?ôs good news for the community of developers who build plugins and themes for the open-source CMS, as well as for web hosts who offer WordPress packages, and designers who offer clients WordPress-based sites and shops.
It?ôs come a long way since it first came into existence back in 2003, having forked into two versions: a self-hosted one that?ôs available for free, and a hosted option at WordPress.com that bundles additional services and support into its offering for ease of use. Given its massive user base and the community that supports its open-source development, it doesn?ôt look like it?ôll be giving up the keys to the CMS kingdom anytime soon.

168,apps,"Twitter?ôs CEO has officially waved the white flag and called for outside help fixing the site?ôs toxicity. Specifically, he?ôs asked for help defining a metric of ?úconversational health??on Twitter.
While it?ôs good to see Twitter attempt to find a system for controlling the behavior of its users, human beings are too complicated to be algorithmically guided into playing nice.
It?ôs no secret that Twitter has, in recent months, been forced to face its epidemic of negativity, from Russian bots to the spread of fake news. Obviously, now?ôs the time for contrition and public vows to fix its business. CEO Jack Dorsey delivered this week with an unexpected tweetstorm laying out his feelings on the situation and his call to action:
We?ôre committing Twitter to help increase the collective health, openness, and civility of public conversation, and to hold ourselves publicly accountable towards progress.
??jack (@jack) March 1, 2018

Jack acknowledges several complaints about his site and what it?ôs become in the modern social media economy:
We have witnessed abuse, harassment, troll armies, manipulation through bots and human-coordination, misinformation campaigns, and increasingly divisive echo chambers.
To that end, he?ôs asked for help coming up with ?úhealth metrics??which will gauge the quality of the site?ôs conversation. He cites as an example (but not a guideline) Cortico?ôs metrics for ?úshared attention, shared reality, variety of opinion, and receptivity.??Basically, that measures whether enough people with different opinions are citing the same facts, talking to each other, and listening.
I understand why Jack?ôs looking for measurable data to work with. It?ôs got to be tricky trying to find a way to get several million people to play nice with each other without censoring any person or group in particular. While it?ôs productive for Twitter to try and hold itself accountable, it?ôs asking for statistical, data-driven help with a problem that?ôs primarily philosophical in nature.
What we know is we must commit to a rigorous and independently vetted set of metrics to measure the health of public conversation on Twitter. And we must commit to sharing our results publicly to benefit all who serve the public conversation.
??jack (@jack) March 1, 2018

Suppose Twitter imposes a social media conversational health metric on a particular account. The metric says the account isn?ôt healthy because it retweets fake news bot tweets, or something similar. What do you do? Ban that account? Would metrics even be limited to certain accounts? Key words? If a site-wide metric said health was suffering, would Twitter go on a purge to find the offending accounts and punish them? What if someone deliberately set out to game the system ??how could Twitter control for that?
Human beings sometimes don?ôt get along. That sounds flip to say when the difficulties of social media cause the arguments to be writ large across the internet. But even if Twitter were to find a metric that told it users were all talking about the same thing and using the right keywords, there?ôd still be arguments, instigators, and trolls.
I think, if Twitter actually buckled down and set to work removing bots and handling reports of abuse and TOS violations in a more timely manner ??either through better automation or a more robust workforce ??it might start to see the site get a little cleaner without having to compile data sets and metrics that could possibly be manipulated.
It?ôs a messy process, punishing people who might turn around and complain that they?ôre being treated poorly. But that?ôs a much more understandable way of diffusing an argument between humans than relying on data that might not translate well into real-world actions.

169,apps,"For some people drawing comes naturally. But, if you?ôre anything like me, your stick figures look like misshapen horrors for whom death would surely be a relief. Enter Sketch AR: the AI-powered app that aims to make you a better artist regardless of your current skill.
The idea is pretty simple: you draw a few plus-signs on a piece of paper, wall, or sleeping friend?ôs face and then point your smartphone?ôs camera at it.
From there you can cycle through point-by-point lessons that help you learn to associate free space with the next layer of a drawing. It?ôs quite intuitive and the overlay makes it feel like drawing on tracing paper, but with augmented reality instead.

To accomplish this, the developers had to figure out how to overcome various problems. For example, when a person is drawing, often their hand gets in the way of the camera. Furthermore, not every surface or ?úcanvas??is the same.
According to a blog post from the developers:
An algorithm teaches the camera to distinguish between everything it sees. For instance, the background is separated from the hand, the hand from its shadow, etc.
The app?ôs recent updates, aside from more robust machine learning, include ?úSketch AR School,??a robust tutorial approach that features several drawings for users to try their hand at.
Best of all, Sketch AR is available to download free on both iOS and Android. It?ôs also available on Microsoft?ôs Hololens platform for developers.

170,apps,"After roughly four years in the making, Microsoft?ôs Soundscape app for guiding people with vision impairment around cities is now available for iOS in the US and the UK.
The aim is to provide 3D audio cues that not only help you find your chosen destination ??whether that?ôs a university building or a coffee shop ??but also to make you aware of exactly where you are and what?ôs around you as you walk.

Microsoft says that Soundscape achieves this by pairing with a stereo headset and calling out the names of roads and landmarks that you pass by. It also lets users find their way to a chosen destination using spatial audio instead of verbal instructions, and can call out points of interest around them so they can familiarize themselves with their surroundings.
Soundscape is designed to be used either on its own or in conjunction with other wayfinding tools and methods, as well as guide animals. It was created in partnership with Guide Dogs UK, and Guide Dogs for the Blind, and the LightHouse for the Blind nonprofit that promotes independence of people who are blind or have low vision.
Hopefully, folks will find this useful and provide Microsoft with feedback to improve and make the app available to more of the 300 million people around with vision impairments.
The company previously released Path Guide, an app for indoor navigation that doesn?ôt rely on GPS of Wi-Fi to help you find destinations in malls, hospitals, and office buildings ??instead, it works with crowdsourced directions for those locations.
If you?ôre in the US or UK, you can try Soundscape right now by grabbing it from the App Store.

171,apps,"TechCrunch reports that Instagram?ôs Android APK includes icons for an interface that would allow audio and video calls, indicating that the service might soon make those features available.
That?ôs Instagram mimicking Snapchat again, and it seems to me like it?ôs copying this functionality at the risk of diluting the app?ôs experience. That?ôs a bummer, because I really like Instagram.
If Snapchat?ôs system is anything to go by, people will be able to call the Instagram users they follow, unless they restrict the feature to only allow pings from people they follow back. Instagram previously added the ability to join Stories via video a few months ago, so perhaps we should have seen this coming.
I?ôm not a fan of this trend of baking every possible functionality into apps just because you can do it ??and with Instagram, it feels like it?ôs all too easy to mar the experience by tacking on too much stuff.
I?ôm happy to broadcast my photos and video there knowing that my audience includes a mix of friends, acquaintances, and strangers who enjoy my posts ??meaning that I?ôm comfortable with the persona I put out there, and with the way I interact with people in the app.
I also like using the messaging features to share visual content with a small bunch of friends and groups that have come together to share our common love for things like watches.
However, I certainly don?ôt want people to call me on the app I use for when I want to simply kill time, or when I?ôm looking for recipes, or looking for gift ideas. And I certainly don?ôt want strangers to be able to video call me just because they?ôve found my public profile.
It?ôs also worth thinking about how this opens up a new avenue for harassment. Even if you can restrict who can call you, the responsibility of preventing harassment now falls upon the user. And unlike Snapchat, most Instagram users leave a record of what they?ôre about in the form of their standard posts, which malicious actors can mine for ammunition they can bully their victims with.
Call me old-fashioned, but I?ôd like to be able to give my consent before being contacted online. It?ôs bad enough that anyone with my phone number can ping me on WhatsApp and the like. C?ômon, Facebook, just let me have this one.
But of course, that?ôs not going to happen. Facebook won?ôt rest until Instagram is every bit the same as Snapchat, only with a larger user base and a better interface. Whatever happened to not fixing what isn?ôt broken?

172,apps,"Facebook this week announced its new Women in Gaming Initiative, dedicated to encouraging more women to join the games industry. The social media company focuses on providing role models and success stories, and it?ôs actually a pleasant approach.
Though gender and diversity in gaming is a sensitive topic at times, Facebook?ôs approach is relatively non-judgmental. The video intro with Sheryl Sandberg focuses on the number of women who game (46 percent in 13 countries, according to the reported data) and how it?ôs at odds with the number of people who make the games (23 percent).
Sandberg goes on to say that women who do enter the industry face some pretty steep struggles:
In this industry, women also face stereotypes and prejudice that hold them back, just like they do in every industry. And when they become the target of online threats, it?ôs even harder to convince young women that this is an industry full of opportunity; and industry that not only values their work?ìbut needs it.
One page on the site is dedicated to compiling videos of women who?ôve found success in the industry, including several of Facebook?ôs own employees, where they speak about their success. Another showcases talks about gaming and diversity, and invites more women to participate.
Admittedly, it does rankle a bit to hear Sandberg list off a number of new female characters (Tracer from Overwatch, Aloy from Horizon Zero Dawn) and claim as examples to show fictional women are ?úbreaking out of the background and becoming lead figures????Ms. Sandberg, there?ôs a Lara Croft and a Samus Aran here to see you. But that?ôs a personal quibble.
It remains to be seen what, if any, effect Facebook?ôs initiative will have on the makeup of the games industry. Apart from the aforementioned talks, the main goal of the initiative seems to be to provide role models, and a reassurance that the industry can be an amicable place for them. Facebook?ôs also partnering with non-profit ?úWomen in Games WIGJ,??which recruits more women into the industry.

For those out of the loop, that means anyone who?ôs paying for Google services like Gmail and Google Drive to use with their own domain.

As with other collaboration tools, it lets you chat with your team and with smaller groups of colleagues, with threaded conversations, document sharing via Google?ôs suite of tools, scheduling for meetings, and video calls with up to 30 people at once through its sister app, Hangouts Meet. And of course, you?ôve got native desktop and mobile apps to log in with.
There?ôs also a bevy of AI-powered bots to handle various tasks and integrate with other services, like Salesforce, Freshdesk, Zenefits, Trello, and Kayak. Developers can build their own bots to tie into Hangouts Chat.
So, where does that leave the original Hangouts? It seems like Google just don?ôt know how to kill it off without inconveniencing users: Hangouts continues to live as an independent service, resides in your G Suite Gmail inbox as another way for people to contact you, and the new Chat service will let you connect with your existing contacts. Yeah, I dunno.
With that, Hangouts Chat is now ready to go up against Slack (6 million users as of last September), Microsoft Teams, Facebook Workplace, Atlassian?ôs Stride, Flock, Zoho Cliq, and Keybase?ôs free Teams.

The service is part of Amazon?ôs Prime subscription, which grants access to fast and often free shipping, as well as Prime Video, for Rs. 999 ($15) a year. That?ôs a sweet deal, considering that rivals like Saavn, Gaana, Apple Music, and Google Play Music cost between Rs. 1,200 ($15) and Rs. 1,440 ($22) annually.

The company hasn?ôt said exactly how large its music catalog is in India; while it offers over 40 million tracks to subscribers of its Prime Unlimited service in the US, Prime Music unlocks only about two million songs in the various markets where?ôs it?ôs available.
That being said, Amazon does offer local music here in India; you can choose from film soundtracks and regional artists in Hindi, English, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Gujarati, and Rajasthani.
That could certainly help keep Prime customers in the country hooked to the subscription plan, and to Amazon?ôs ecosystem of services and products. It recently launched its Echo speakers in India, and its Alexa assistant now boasts more than 12,000 skills there.
Alexa is also built into the Prime Music app, so you can use your voice to search for music and stations, as well as surface songs and albums you?ôve previously played through the service?ôs beta with your Echo hardware.
In my brief test, Prime Music feels rather basic, and seems to be geared towards people who listen to whatever?ôs on the radio rather than to folks who enjoy curating and discovering new tunes.
The home screen is littered with recommendations of the most popular tracks from around the world (yep, some of you are still into Ed Sheeran?ôs ?òShape of You??from last January); songs from the Top Rock station date back as far as the early 2000s (Staind, anyone?), and the ?òMusic for Every Mood??section features playlists with regional-language music, even though I didn?ôt select any of those languages during the setup process. There?ôs also no way to generate a station or playlist with tracks similar to stuff from a song, artist, or album you like.
Ultimately, Prime Music will likely find fans among casual listeners here in India, and give them another reason to consider renewing their Prime subscription. But in its current state, it?ôs hard to see it competing directly with other established streaming services.

177,apps,"In the last few days a fledgling social media app shot to the top of the free app charts. Vero is a bit of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram all rolled into one and it?ôd undoubtedly be over the moon dethroning any or all of those apps.
Spoiler alert: it won?ôt.
Vero has been on the market for three years. Recently, certain contingents of vloggers and ?òGrammers (is that what Instagram stars are called? If not, it should be) have started advertising their moves to Vero. This has caused such a dramatic upswing in user numbers that the app crashes repeatedly ??I can?ôt even search for new users to add without encountering a server error.
Wait so can someone explain what ?úVero??is ?òÇ
??Edwin Honoret ?çç (@Edwin_Honoret) February 27, 2018

While it has many, many similarities to Instagram, the differences are what put Vero on the radar: The news feed is arranged chronologically, rather than by algorithm; there are no advertisements; and you can also post text statuses, links, and music recommendations. If your problem with any of the aforementioned apps is ads or the fact that you?ôll see 20 day-old posts from the same twelve people even if you follow 200, then you?ôre the kind of person Vero is trying to grab.
Supposedly, the app will be free for the first million users, and everyone who signs up after that milestone will have to pay a subscription. Considering the app was created by a billionaire, I?ôm sure it?ôll be able to stay afloat until that point.
So what?ôs the problem?
Let?ôs start by saying the app design is rather repellent. That?ôs personal preference, I know, and I don?ôt want to shit on the small fish in the pond for that reason alone ??but the translucent teal GUI lacks Instagram?ôs je ne sais quoi.
I tried out Vero, and its design says ""what if linkedin designed a shitty nightclub?""
??brook shelley (@brookshelley) February 26, 2018

There?ôs also the problem that no one seems to know what to do with the app, when they can even use it without server errors in the first place.
Just made a Vero??don?ôt know what I?ôm doing ?òÇ
??Kailyn Lowry (@KailLowry) February 27, 2018

Additionally, a few of the people who have advertised their Vero profiles have also said their primary reason for joining the app is just to claim their names, rather than out of any fondness for the app itself.
It?ôs just a snowball effect. People like us want to see what it?ôs like or even just claim our names in case it gets successful. Tbh I saw big flaws in it immediately and haven?ôt touched it since the first day but hey! I have my name just in case rofl
??Dodger (@dexbonus) February 27, 2018

Let?ôs be honest: You know Facebook is going to chew up Vero and spit it out, just like it?ôs done with Ello, Mastodon, and a dozen other apps. Vero tastes like the flavor of the moment, and having users join just to keep control of their branding or to stick it to Instagram isn?ôt the same as building a dedicated userbase who appreciates the app?ôs peculiarities.
And the problem with subscriptions is that I doubt very much that there?ôs a group of people who care enough about social media to pay for it. That?ôs the beauty of social media: It requires little effort or investment.
So I don?ôt recommend anyone get a Vero account, even for the dubious enticement of being one of the first million. The signs that we?ôve got another Snapchat on our hands are just not there.

Responding to a thread asking to include the feature in the next iteration of the mobile operating system, a Google employee confirmed that its engineering team has added the functionality.
Responding to a thread asking to include the feature in the next iteration of the mobile operating system, a Google employee confirmed that its engineering department has added the functionality.
?úOur engineering team has added [dark mode],??the employee said. ?úIt will be available in a future Android release.??Unfortunately, the message makes no mention precisely in which iteration the new feature will land.
But from the looks of it, it will likely be included in the upcoming Android P.
Among other advantages, dark mode makes browsing at night less heavy on the eyes and also reduces battery drain.
For the record, the Big G has been toying around with the idea of including dark mode in its OS since at least the release of Android M. More recently, the feature was spotted in the developer version of Android N, but ultimately did not make it to the commercial release.

Indeed, my colleague Napier Lopez highlighted the lack of dedicated black mode as one of the reasons why custom-built Android skins are swiftly catching up with stock Android ??especially when it comes to user experience and easy of use.
It?ôs not clear whether dark mode will work in third-party software, but the good thing is that a number of apps have already taken the initiative to build their own modes for browsing at night. The list includes Twitter, YouTube and Samsung?ôs Internet browser.
In the meantime, you can always resort to third-party apps like Substratum to enable dark mode ??or just try one of these tricks.
Update: TechCrunch reports that dark mode isn?ôt really coming to Android anytime soon, as the engineer quoted above clarified his statement, saying that Google is actually making it easier for devs to add dark mode to their Android apps in a future version of the OS:
?¶What we *have* added in a future Android release is a developer-facing setting (via Developer Options) to toggle the -night UI mode qualifier, which will make it easier for developers to create and test apps that implement night mode. This qualifier has been in the platform since Froyo (SDK 8) and globally modifiable via UiModeManager since Marshmallow (SDK 23); however, there was never an explicit toggle made available anywhere in Settings.
If it?ôs any consolation, we will also not be adding Hot Dog Mode (where all UI elements are yellow and red).

First up, ARCore (which was announced back in August 2017) has now hit version 1.0, which means it?ôs ready for prime time. That?ôs evident from the update to its app, which Android Police has got a hold of and made available on APKMirror.
Next, a source at Google told Variety that the company intends to carry out its plan of bringing ARCore to 100 million phones by March. That means it?ôll need to enable support for the framework on a wider range of devices (only Pixel handsets are natively supported at the moment).
Samsung lineup of high-end Android phones seems most likely to gain ARCore support first, as its Galaxy S8 was made eligible to run a developer preview version of the framework.
The other major change to help with adoption is that ARCore now works not just with Android Oreo 8.0, but also with the older Nougat versions. That makes sense, given that only a small number of handsets are presently running the latest version of the Android platform. I?ôm also interpreting this as a reduction in the need for additional depth-sensing hardware components, which Google previously required for the now-defunct Project Tango that preceded ARCore.
It?ôll be interesting to see what that spells for users and developers. While Apple fans have been able to access a wide range of AR experiences thanks to the company?ôs rapid rollout of ARKit, ARCore content has largely been restricted to animated stickers that you can place in real-world scenes seen through your phone?ôs camera.

The tweet, by itself, doesn?ôt sound too damning:
sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me??ugh this is so sad.
??Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) February 21, 2018

Considering Kylie recently gave birth to her daughter Stormi, I initially took this to mean that she wasn?ôt able to keep up her previous social media schedule. However, couple this with a tweet from earlier this month, and it looks like more like an indictment of the app:
Mm just saw the new Snapchat.. I don?ôt know how i feel about it! What do you guys think?
??Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) February 9, 2018

Today, Snap shares on the stock market dropped by 7 percent, and Snap lost as much as $1 billion in market value. It certainly sounds like Kylie was the one who sent Wall Street into a panic, but she didn?ôt do it by herself.
While I have no doubt Kylie holds enough sway to get a few social media addicts to avoid the app, I don?ôt think the people who are migrating away from Snapchat are doing so strictly because of her. The schism in Snapchat started weeks ago, and it?ôs plain to see for anyone who?ôs watching the company?ôs fortunes closely.
The main reason people have been complaining about Snapchat lately ??and have they ever been complaining ??is due to the app?ôs redesigned layout. Reviews on both the App Store and Google Play are littered with harsh words about the unintuitive new design. There?ôs even a Change.org petition asking Snap to kill the update. It?ôs been signed by a whopping 1.2 million people at the time of this writing ??a non-insubstantial portion of Snapchat?ôs userbase.
Perhaps the most infuriating part of it, for those who want to see Snapchat changed, is that the company has made it clear they have no intention of complying. Last week, a spokesperson told Variety that Snap is essentially waiting for the users to get used to the changes: ?úUpdates as big as this one can take a little getting used to, but we hope the community will enjoy it once they settle in.??
Snap responded to the petition directly two days ago, saying the app?ôs new changes ?úwill adapt to you the more that you use it.??The comments replying to this are decidedly frosty.

So the writing was on the wall long before Kylie admitted her own move away from Snapchat. Sure, her tweets may have been the catalyst for the stock market panic ??considering her popularity, she makes a good barometer for public opinion about Snapchat. But she?ôs not the reason people are losing interest in the app.
For her part, Kylie doesn?ôt seem to be burning her bridges too badly. The last thing she had to say on the topic was more congenial:
still love you tho snap ??my first love

182,apps,
183,apps,"Product Hunt just launched a new tech news aggregator app, called Sip. Think of it as an unholy hybrid of Twitter Moments, and Reddit?ôs autotldr bot. Stories are hand-picked and then compressed into the pertinent parts, along with some relevant commentary from Twitter. Sip presents these in digestible bite-sized chunks, which you can casually scroll through.
Here?ôs how Sip presented the launch of Uber Express POOL. It presents the news in your typical inverted-pyramid style. Along the way, it throws into the mix links to deeper coverage from other tech sites, like The Verge, along with comment from Uber?ôs CEO and other notable tech commentators, like Gadgette?ôs Holly Brockwell and TechCrunch?ôs Josh Constine.
This is a really compelling style of storytelling. It?ôs clearly inspired by Twitter Moments, but stories feel a lot more fleshed-out. There?ôs more detail. More context.
I presume that?ôs because Sip is aimed at Product Hunt?ôs community of makers and tech enthusiasts, who likely want to take a deeper dive into news stories, without necessarily dealing with the legwork of reading 1,000 words or so.
(In the interest of transparency, I should point out there are only a handful of stories on the app at the moment. I?ôm writing this before it?ôs officially been launched.)
Sip bundles stories into daily roundups. So, once I finished reading about Uber Pool Express, I was immediately taken to a story about Houseparty?ôs success in capturing the lucrative (but fickle) teen demographic.
This is an inherently linear approach. Once you finish a story, you?ôre taken to the next one. You can?ôt dive in-and-out, as you would with a traditional RSS reader.
And as you?ôd expect with a tech news app from Product Hunt, new apps and gadgets feature heavily. Stories about products follow roughly the same format. You?ôre presented with the salient details, along with expert comment and hot-takes from Twitter.
What separates Sip from the other micro-news apps (and there are several, believe me) is that it?ôs kind to your attention span by design. Unlike email or a traditional RSS reader, which you might check several times a day, Sip sends just one push notification in a 24-hour period. There?ôs no need to instinctively check it.
It?ôs also pretty conservative with how it uses push notifications. It doesn?ôt buzz or bleep, or do anything that otherwise might break your concentration.

Sip isn?ôt a groundbreaking product, insofar as its inspirations are obvious (Twitter Moments), and there are a lot of other similar apps on the market. Simply News, for example, offers ultra-compact stories.
But what makes Sip awesome is how it presents that news; both in terms of storytelling and how it alerts you to news. If you?ôre tempted to give it a spin, you can download it on Android and iOS today.

As spotted by observant users on Reddit, what triggers the bug is the search input ??or namely ?òhow to send a message to Barack Obama.??Instead of Obama?ôs contact details, the search breeds a long string of incomprehensible characters.
Here?ôs what happens when you type in the ?òmagic??words:

Whatever the cause of the bug is, it doesn?ôt seem to be affecting the overall functionality of the Google app. This means you can go on browsing through your content feed pretty much uninterrupted.
We tried reproducing the glitch by searching for how to ?úsend a message to Donald Trump??and the app handled the request without any hiccups. We couldn?ôt reproduce the issue on iOS either.
 
As is often the case with such minor blunders, the Mountain View giant will likely fix the issue within the next couple of days. In the meantime, anybody interested in getting in touch with Obama ought to look up his contact details directly from Search.
We?ôve reached out to Google to notify them about this unexpected behavior and ask about what caused this unusual glitch. We?ôll update this piece accordingly if we hear back.

Now, it?ôs getting a shot in the arm from the co-founder of a rival app.
Brian Acton, who built WhatsApp with Jan Koum into a $19 billion business and sold it to Facebook, is pouring $50 million into an initiative to support the ongoing development of Signal.
Having left WhatsApp last fall, he?ôs now free to explore projects whose ideals he agrees with, and that includes creating truly private online services.
In a blog post, Signal?ôs Moxie Marlinspike explained that with Acton?ôs funding, the newly formed Signal Foundation will be able to grow the development team behind the app, as well as its vision. Acton echoed the sentiment, saying, ?úOur long-term vision is for the Signal Foundation to provide multiple offerings that align with our core mission.??
Marlinspike will take on the role of CEO at the Foundation, while Acton will serve as executive chairman. It?ôll be interesting to see what they build together; after all, you don?ôt earn praise from whistleblower Edward Snowden without crafting a world-class secure service first.

186,apps,"Some Twitter users woke up to an unpleasant surprise this morning: Upon attempting to access their Twitter accounts, they were told they were temporarily locked out of their accounts.
Shortly after this, the hashtag #TwitterLockout began trending, as users began to complain of being censored or persecuted by the site.
That wasn?ôt all of it. Upon logging in, they discovered they had lost a number of followers. Some users have speculated that the loss of follower numbers is part of a ?úbot purge.??
Trumpers try to understand; the followers you are losing tonight are not real people. They were bots and @Twitter decided enough was enough. You aren?ôt being censored. You are being awakened to the FACT that you were engaging with hostile foreign agents! #TwitterLockOut pic.twitter.com/zK7RSlm8Rg
??Corey Reynolds (@coreyreynoldsLA) February 21, 2018

The crux of the complaint appears to be that many of the affected users were politically conservative, meaning it appeared that the site was censoring or otherwise going after a certain group in particular.
I've lost close to 1,000 followers offer the past few hours. 
Major purge underway.
??Richard ?êâ Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) February 21, 2018

Others were more circumspect:
Folks, many of the followers you may have lost in the overnight ""purge"" may actually just be from Twitter locking some accounts until they confirm their identities.  As these people confirm, your lost followers return.  We'll see.  I've already gained back 1200 this morning.
??Bill Mitchell (@mitchellvii) February 21, 2018

Twitter, for its part, insists that the request is not politically motivated. According to a Twitter spokesperson:
Twitter?ôs tools are apolitical, and we enforce our rules without political bias. As part of our ongoing work in safety, we identify suspicious account behaviors that indicate automated activity or violations of our policies around having multiple accounts, or abuse. We also take action on any accounts we find that violate our terms of service, including asking account owners to confirm a phone number so we can confirm a human is behind it. That?ôs why some people may be experiencing suspensions or locks. This is part of our ongoing, comprehensive efforts to make Twitter safer and healthier for everyone.
Judging by their own phrasing, this is part of a larger campaign by Twitter to eliminate automated accounts, which have been a massive problem for the platform in recent months.

I just sideloaded a beta version of it earlier today, and it already looks pretty promising as an assistant that helps you text faster.
Once you?ôve installed Reply on your Android device and granted it the necessary permissions, the app will take over notifications from services like WhatsApp, Twitter DM, Hangouts, and Slack, and add buttons labeled with responses; tap one and it?ôll send it out instantly.
In my brief testing, I found it to work like a charm with day-to-day conversations. Here, have a look at some replies it suggested below:

Essentially, it negates the need to type out responses to straightforward messages and questions. If you?ôve tried Smart Reply in Google?ôs Inbox and Gmail apps, this will feel familiar to you.
As Android Police noted, some features that we heard about, like responding with your exact travel time to a location, don?ôt yet work; however, this is still a beta build and it?ôs safe to assume that such niggles will be sorted before Reply is ready for prime time.
Besides saving me the effort of a few swipes on my keyboard, it also seems like it could kill my texting paralysis ??that occasional inertia I experience when trying to think of what to say, or whether I?ôm saying it the right way.
Whether Reply will kill off the art of textual conversation is a matter for another piece ??but for making plans, confirming your presence at an event, and answering basic questions from your contacts, it?ôs a real time-saver.
Google?ôs getting fairly good at this ahead of the competition, so it?ôll be interesting to see if rivals build their own AI-powered tools for the job, or if Reply will be around for a while and continue to evolve.

From the comparison images showing the refreshed textures, it seems like Burnout Paradise Remastered will be worth a go for fans of the original, as well as newcomers alike.

Because social media is a tawdry pile of copied homework, it shouldn?ôt come as a surprise that Snapchat is finally doing unto others what has been done unto it ??Instagram just introduced this exact feature last month.
In order to use the feature, select the sticker icon from the Snap editing screen ??check our guide if you need a primer on how that works. Then tap search to bring up a list of stickers from GIPHY. They function just like stationary stickers, down to the ability to stick them to moving objects in videos ??a feature which you might recognize from the GIPHY World ARKit app from last year. Like I said: copied homework.
Another update coming to the app is a tab feature which groups Friend stories, Discover, and Group Chats into separate tabs. We?ôve contacted Snapchat for clarity about whether this is something users can customize for their own convenience or just a new sorting system.
Presumably this is part of Snapchat?ôs attempt to simplify its notoriously user-unfriendly app, as CEO Evan Spiegel promised to do last year. The redesign is already off to a rocky start, with users across the board decrying the confusing update and pleading for a chance to roll back to a previous version. The app?ôs ratings have tanked on the App Store, with recent negative reviews both there and on Google Play mentioning the update specifically.

191,apps,"Google has updated its Tez payments app for users in India with the ability to pull up your bills from a number of local service providers and settle them with just a tap.
The company announced that the new functionality was in the works back in December 2017, when it announced that Tez was set to cross 12 million users in the country. When it launched in September last year, it only supported peer-to-peer payments via the national Unified Payments Interface (UPI) system, which allows for transactions directly between bank accounts, at no cost.

The update now lets you view billing history for a range of service providers you?ôre registered with, including including national and state electricity providers, gas and water, and DTH TV. Once you?ôve had a look at what you owe, you can pay off your bills with a single tap.
Linking accounts takes no time at all, and payments work just as painlessly as Tez?ôs P2P transactions. All you need to do is hit the ?òNew payment??button, search for your service provider, enter your account details, and you?ôll then be able to see pending bills ??and if the company uses Bharat BillPay, your older bills will show up too.
That negates the need for logging into various sites and apps to keep your essential services up and running at home.
With that, Google is well on its way to gobbling up a big piece of the mobile payments pie in India; it?ôs quickly begun evolving Tez from a UPI app to a platform. After enabling payments to service providers, the company will try to get independent merchants and small businesses to adopt it this year.
It?ôll then find itself going up against WhatsApp, which recently introduced a tool for businesses to chat directly with customers and send them transaction alerts, as well as support for UPI-based payments between users in India right from their conversations. Meanwhile, Paytm, which operates a digital wallet, payments bank, and offers UPI money transfers, launched a messaging service within its app. It?ôll be interesting to see if Google can beat out these companies in garnering a larger user base in the coming years, as the company estimates that digital payments in the country will hit $500 billion by 2020.

192,apps,"During an earnings call in late January, Mark Zuckerberg surprised everyone by saying people spending less time on Facebook is a good thing. Moreover, time spent on Facebook will likely continue to decrease as the company implements further changes to the platform over the next year.
It was a startling remark by the CEO of a company that makes money almost exclusively from advertising, but his message was simple: quality over quantity.
The tech media?ôs response was predictable. Zuckerberg was doing a PR spin on bad numbers. Facebook made bad choices and was reaping the consequences. People don?ôt trust Facebook anymore. Of course people use Facebook less, Facebook is just boring now.
Here?ôs a crazy idea: What if Facebook actually is trying to be better?
Is it so unreasonable to believe that ??after fake news entered the common lexicon ??Facebook has seen the dark side to its power and ubiquity? That it?ôs willing to put aside some temporary ad revenue in order to ensure it has a positive influence going forward?
As a general rule, the cynicism of modern tech journalism brushes that possibility aside. Apparently, everything the big companies do makes us depressed, threatens our privacy, or poses a security hazard. Read a few thinkpieces per week and you?ôd be convinced the tech industry is banding together to make the world a worse place.
It wasn?ôt always this way. As Martin Bryant ?? TNW?ôs former Editor in Chief ??puts it, tech journalism used to fawn over companies in a combination of naive optimism and a battle for access. That lack of accountability on the media?ôs end helped enable some of the tech industry?ôs worst behavior.
In response, the tech media became more skeptical and critical, but also tends to overcompensate, creating a negative narrative that is often at odds with the perspective of people actually using tech products.

Which brings us back to Facebook. The social media juggernaut has made ethically questionable choices over the years, operating with a business model basically designed to maximize addiction. But lately, after the 2016 election in particular, Facebook seems to be listening:
These are just a few examples, but company has been criticized at each stage.
Scrutiny remains important, and no one?ôs saying Facebook couldn?ôt do more. But if we tech journalists want our criticism to actually affect matter and affect change, it?ôs just as important to acknowledge when progress is happening. Fundamentally changing a product as massive as Facebook won?ôt happen overnight.
It?ôs not unreasonable to think Zuckerberg (and most of his employees) are genuinely working to make Facebook better. In an interview with the New York Times in January, the CEO said: ?úIt?ôs important to me that when Max and August grow up that they feel like what their father built was good for the world.??
Even considering business motives behind the change ??long-term loyalty vs short-term revenue, for instance ??these aren?ôt mutually exclusive with a better Facebook.
Facebook is Zuckerberg?ôs legacy ??the reason he?ôll be in history books. Two paths lie ahead of him: he could be remembered as a man who enabled technological mass addiction, depression and indoctrination on a global scale, or he could also be the man who achieved his goal of connecting the world and creating a global community.
I know I?ôd be fighting for the latter.

193,apps,"The Wikimedia Foundation has killed off Wikipedia Zero, an initiative to deliver the online encyclopedia at no charge to mobile users around with the world.
The zero-rated service was launched back in 2012 and saw the nonprofit partner with mobile carriers to waive the cost for accessing Wikipedia; it was available through 97 mobile operators in 72 countries, with a cumulative 800 million subscribers.
The organization said that it noticed ?úa significant drop off in adoption and interest in the program,??over the past two years, and cited low awareness about Wikipedia as one of the reasons why people weren?ôt using it. The other reason is actually a sign of change for the better: mobile data costs have been dropping in the past few years.
According to research by the Alliance for Affordable Internet coalition from last November, countries in Africa saw the greatest drop in data charges between 2015 and 2016 ??though the price still remains the highest in the world when considered as a percentage of average income.
Credit: A4AI
That?ôs still a good sign, and it?ôs likely that the emergence of newer technologies like 5G, as well as the proliferation of 4G, will drive these costs even lower in the coming years.
It?ôs also worth noting that Wikipedia?ôs service may not be scalable across the globe, as regulators in some ocuntries frown upon zero-rated services that subsidize the cost of access to subscribers, as it has the potential to grant companies an advantage over their competition.
While India?ôs Aircel carrier signed on to offer Wikipedia Zero to its 60 million subscribers back in 2013 without much of a fuss, Facebook found its Free Basics zero-rated service banned in the country following backlash from critics who were concerned about it becoming a gatekeeper that could control what information and services internet first-timers would be able to access.
The Wikimedia Foundation says it?ôs evaluating other ways of bringing Wikipedia to more people around the world, so we?ôll have to wait and see how it attempts to achieve that after carriers??contracts to deliver Wikipedia Zero expire through 2018.

Basically, it means you now need to click through to a photo?ôs website, find the image, right click on it, and select ?úopen image in new tab????or your browser?ôs equivalent ??to view the photo in an isolated, full-size form. Sometimes, these images are deeply hidden in a page or only found after an inordinate amount of scrolling.
And while you can technically just right click the image within Google search and do the same, they aren?ôt always at full resolution, depending on their source. Either way, it?ôs a mildly annoying extra step that will likely also confuse some of the less tech-saavy users out there.
The change comes after a long legal spat with Getty Images over how its photos were being disseminated throughout the search engine, the companies shook hands and formed a partnership. Google will now remove view links for Getty photographs and make copyright disclaimers more prominent.
It seems highly likely that removing the ?òView Image??button was part of the agreement as well, but it?ôs not clear why it had to extend beyond Getty images.
As a photographer who sometimes worries about his own images being misused, I can sympathize with Getty  but I seriously doubt this move is going to prevent people from stealing images; it?ôll just make it more annoying.

Vimium is also pretty customizable: you can create exclusions so it doesn?ôt interfere with sites that already support shortcuts. For example, it automatically sets the J and K keys to act as scroll up/down buttons, and those same keys let me jump between articles on Feedly; you can hit the extension button in Chrome while visiting Feedly to quickly turn off all or certain shortcuts for that domain.

Interestingly, Apple didn?ôt say anything about existing apps needing to update with iPhone X support and iOS 11 SDK.

According to Android Police, the lightweight Gmail Go is practically indistinguishable in terms of features and functionality from Gmail; the only major difference is that it?ôs available for Android Go from Google Play; however, if your device is running Android Oreo 8.1, you can sideload the app by installing it from APKMirror. You?ôll find the installer to be roughly 10MB lighter than standard Gmail at 9.5 MB; when installed, it takes up 24.8 MB ??about half of Gmail?ôs 47.28 MB.

But it seems that the feature doesn?ôt always work as intended ??especially when someone has already quoted the text you want to purge.
We noticed that quoted messages in group chats continue to show in quotes even after they have been wiped. Attempting the same thing in a private chat bred the exact same results. It would appear that this is another instance of the classic ?úit?ôs a feature, not a bug??conundrum. We?ôve reached out to WhatsApp for a clarification.
In any case, you should probably mind what you say when you talk to people who are in the habit of using quotes.
Here is how this looks:

As you can observe in the screenshot, while the original message will successfully disappear, the deleted text continues to show in the recipient?ôs quote.
WhatsApp highlights in its FAQ that you can only delete messages for up to seven minutes after they have been sent ??as long as both the sender and the recipient are using the latest version of the app. Curiously, it makes no mention how the feature works in cases of quotes.
It is worth noting that researchers have previously discovered other shortcomings in WhatsApp?ôs implementation of deleted messages.
One particularly gnarly flaw ??discovered by Spanish tech blog AndroidJefe (original in Spanish) ??made it possible to recover deleted messages from the Android notification history. Relying on third-party apps, users could browse the notification log to read purged texts.

Essentially, an industry group called the Coalition for Better Ads ??of which Google is a member ??has defined standards for what qualify as intrusive ads. The list includes full-page interstitials that appear before a page loads, flashing animated ads, and videos that autoplay with sound.
Google says it will first evaluate sites for violations of the above standards, then inform the offending sites and make reports available to them via an API, and then begin blocking ads on those pages after 30 days. It?ôs worth noting that if a site is in violation of the Better Ads standards, all ads on its pages will be blocked, and not just the ads that aren?ôt in line.
Chrome?ôs desktop version will notify you that it?ôs blocking ads similar to how it lets you know about pop-ups; on Android, you?ôll see a bar appear at the bottom of the screen, with an option to allow ads if that?ôs how you want to roll.

That sounds like a fun tool for getting the kids to ping grandma every once in a while, but you should know that Facebook funded the experts who vetted the app to certify it as safe to use for children as young as six.
Conflict of interest, anyone?
Moreover, Wired reported that the company also waited until the last minute to consult a couple of major nonprofits who look into technology developed for children; that resulted in a campaign consisting of child-health activists railing against the launch of the app.

The Snapchat toy box has been so thoroughly raided that the few sites left who haven?ôt done it are starting to look pass√©.
So here?ôs my question: Pinterest, Google Plus ??when are you getting in on this action?
Pinterest could easily co-opt Snapchat?ôs short-form visual updates. Maybe it could use a feature that lets people share the twee animal and food pictures for a limited time in a kind of grid? Perhaps a place to post stuff they find immediately appealing but don?ôt necessarily want to save forever. I would say that sounds like a stretch, but I would never have thought Stories belonged on Facebook, and here we are now.
As for Google Plus (yeah, that still exists), maybe it could open a limited version of the Stories feature to its users, to let them make their own updates with the same visual format as Snapchat Discover.
Snapchat knows it?ôs only a matter of time before everyone is copying them. Let?ôs have it happen sooner, rather than later ??if only so we can see what the remaining sites come up with.

205,apps,"Facebook is reportedly releasing two smart speakers later this year to compete with the Amazon Echo. The two devices, apparently codenamed ?úFiona??and ?úAloha,??could be released as early as July.
Reports about the speakers first surfaced last year, with Business Insider naming Aloha. Bloomberg later revealed the second device and gave more details about how the two would operate, with one being a touchscreen device similar to the Echo Show and the other a more traditional smart speaker.
Today, Digitimes reported the two devices are set to release in July at the latest. Aloha, the larger of the two with a 15-inch touchscreen, will have facial and voice recognition, and will have social features by way of Facebook and Messenger. Video calls seem like the most obvious choice for a smart device with a screen and a camera. The original report claimed that a 13-inch version of Aloha was also in the works.
Comparatively little has been said about Fiona, except that it will supposedly come with a Siri-like assistant. The Digitimes report claims that it will also have a touchscreen, but that runs counter to Bloomberg?ôs initial report that the second Facebook device would be a standalone speaker. If it is a speaker, it could look something like the modular device Facebook patented last year.
There has been little official word from Facebook about the devices ??it didn?ôt respond to a request for comment. No images of the devices have been released. If Facebook is working on these devices and intends to release them in July, it?ôd better get a move on showing us what they might look like.

The new superpower will arrive in the form of Reply, an app that the company is slated to begin testing soon. Essentially, it?ôll let you reply to messages in apps like Hangouts, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger, by tapping on buttons with short replies that are meaningful in the context of the conversation you?ôre having with your contacts ??straight from your notifications.

There are a couple more interesting features planned, including a Do Not Disturb mode that?ôs automatically turned on when you?ôre driving to silence your phone and alert those who message you that you can?ôt text right then; critical messages like, ?úWe?ôre waiting for you!??will trigger an alert even if your phone is set to silent; a vacation responder will automatically let people know you?ôre off the clock by checking your calendar.

As someone who?ôs trying to use their phone less, I can?ôt wait for Reply to arrive. It?ôll likely only be available for Android, though, and Google says it?ôs still very early days, so we may have to wait a while.
Google previously introduced similar functionality in Inbox for Gmail, as well as Allo and Android Messages.

207,apps,"People can post just about anything to Facebook: photos, videos, emo song lyrics, GIFs, stickers, shower thoughts with fancy colored backgrounds, etc. But you know what Facebook needs more of? Lists, apparently.
That?ôs now changing. Back in January, our social media guru Matt Navarra spotted a feature that allowed you to create lists with a similar set of gradient backgrounds to status posts. The lists show up as an option when you create a new status, and can be in either numbered or bullet-point form.
Although it was only a test at the time, TechCrunch reports the feature will begin a slow global rollout today.
Facebook seems to be trying to deliver on its recent promise of making the social network a bit more personal; it wants you share more about you and less outside content. They also seem to be designed to be shared with friends, the way people often list their favorite movies/foods/whatever and ask friends to comment with their own.

In case you?ôre still having trouble imagining why you?ôd want to make a list on Facebook here?ôs handy idea list:
The possibilities are endless.
Some have already questioned whether the company has ulterior motives in implementing lists; they could theoretically provide easy data about your interests that advertisers could use. Facebook?ôs Adam Mosseri, Head of News Feed, says the feature was simply a response to use cases he was already seeing.
Actually we built lists because we saw lots of people creating lists as long statuses and with pictures, and thought it would be good to make it easier for people to create lists first class. I hope we can get to a point, someday, where you don't always assume ill intent.
??Adam Mosseri (@mosseri) February 13, 2018

Granted, creating lists might not be the most pressing issue Facebook has to deal with, but I do see people share lists regularly on my own feed. I also think making the New Feed more personal is a step in the right direction if the company honestly wants to move away from being a news source and more about encouraging interaction with friends.. But I?ôm biased ??I love lists.
Whatever the motivation, I expect people are going to use these a lot. We?ôre not seeing it yet on any of our own devices ??it is indeed a slow rollout ??but it?ôs just a matter of time now.

That squeaking noise you hear? That?ôs my face cringing so hard the muscles are strained.
According to Facebook, new couples will be prompted to choose a custom color for their presumably lovey-dovey chat, along with a custom emoji (in the lower right corner, the default being a thumbs up) and nicknames. The way it phrases this process makes it sound like some new, romantic feature within the app.
Trouble is, you can already set custom colors, emoji, and nicknames in any Messenger conversation, regardless of your relationship status. Messenger isn?ôt doing anything new so much as popping up like that one busybody friend who insists the two of you immediately come up with a portmanteau couple name.
There is one new feature, of dubious usefulness: Whomever you?ôre in a relationship with will appear at the top of your active tab, the Messenger equivalent of the green-dotted sidebar on the desktop site.
That might sound helpful, in a meddling sort of way, but assuming Messenger is your primary form of communication to begin with, your chat with bae will probably already be in the recent chat list, the default screen when you open Messenger.
The only thing that sounds mildly romantic is Messenger showering your couples chat with hearts when you open it. Other than that, Messenger will have a variety of saccharine filters and effects to mark the occasion, including candy hearts, heart eyes, and a Queen of Hearts filter that looks really unromantic if you?ôve read any of Alice in Wonderland.

Here is how this looks like:

After introducing AMP back in 2015, the Big G continued to hone the technology, eventually integrating it into its ad formats in order to make them much lighter and faster. Now it appears the company wants to do the same with emails.
The idea to bake AMP straight into Gmail comes only hours after Google revealed its new AMP story format ??which aims to empower creators to build image, video, and animation intensive experiences for mobile ??at AMP Conf in Amsterdam earlier today.

Unfortunately, its emoji have continued to be terrible, often expressing radically different emotions than those of other brands.

As first reported by Emojipedia, the Oreo update includes Samsung Experience 9.0, which brings redesigned the redesigned emoji in addition to a host of new features. Although the overall aesthetic of the emoji hasn?ôt changed ??I much prefer Google?ôs stock emoji ??Samsung is trying to at least make its emoji convey the same emotions as everyone else.
One of the worst offenders was the rolling-eyes emoji. On previous Samsung phones, it looks all-around jolly, instead of the sarcastic (or mildly creepy) look on virtually every other device. As Jeremy Burge of Emojipedia once pointed out, if you try sending this message on a Samsung device??

Here is what the new addition looks like:
Users can access the Stories photo-editing tool by clicking the ?úEdit Photo??button in the right bottom corner. Among other things, the feature lets you choose among several different fonts and color styles.
Prior to this addition, the social media titan brought Stories to its desktop version too ??a move many saw as doubling down on its previous botched attempts to get traction to the functionality.
Facebook initially began toying around with the idea of adopting Stories to its app a little over year ago. But it seems that unlike Instagram and Snapchat, Facebook has been struggling to get its users excited about the feature.
At some point the company resorted to a bizarre marketing tactic, displaying faded images of people who never use Stories at the top of the main Facebook app ??sort of like ghosts.

It?ôs worth noting that Chromecast could be a big performance and battery drain depending on the type of video you?ôre using. As per VLC?ôs blog post:
If media codecs are supported by your Chromecast device, VLC only acts as a streaming server (which is battery consuming). If not, VLC will transcode andstream media, which is highly cpu and battery consuming.

216,apps,"Twitter today announced its first profit since the company went public in 2013. Now in the black, the Jack Dorsey-led microblogging platform pocketed a cool $91.1 million in the fourth quarter of last year.
Now that Twitter is in the black, it?ôs time for Dorsey to put that profit to good use. He can start with fixing the platform?ôs lingering issues with bots and spam.
Bots have become an especially noticeable (if not new) problem on Twitter. According to a report by the New York Times, bot peddlers have done brisk business on the site, setting up thousands upon thousands of fake accounts to follow and retweet paying customers, sometimes even stealing identities to do it. The NYT also reported Twitter believed it might have as many as 60 million bot accounts.
Twitter seemingly began a purge of fake accounts after the report went live. Some users reported massive follower count drops.
The bots aren?ôt just a harmless business either ??the follower count of major Twitter users is one thing that lends them credibility. Their auto-likes and retweets help tweets go viral and put major figures on their social media thrones. What these bots do, and who makes them do it, matters.
Twitter seems to be aware of the scope of the problem. In a letter to investors, it said the number of monthly active users might be affected by its attempts to cut down on fake accounts, and that it?ôs committed to making Twitter a better place all around:
We are committed to making Twitter safer, and we are clarifying our policies, improving our enforcement, and communicating more clearly.

You won?ôt be able to keep the creation permanently, however. As part of the creation, you have to enter a time and place for the Lens to be active, meaning it?ôs best suited for events with set dates. After that, they disappear. Also, they aren?ôt free.

Offering users the chance to make their own feels more special than Geofilters, which has been the app?ôs only custom option for a while.
Snapchat already opened its Lenses to the creativity of the masses last year with Lens Studio. That allowed everyone to make the dancing hotdog of their dreams.

First off, you?ôll find an option in Google?ôs flight search to look up hotels for your destination, complete with pictures and a map view to spot accommodation by location and price.

According to Patreon, ?úAll content disappears after 24 hours, so you can deliver authentic unedited content without worrying about taking the perfect shot.??
I?ôm with every part of that until the very last one.
The idea behind Snapchat?ôs story updates is that you can quickly toss out whatever rough, half-baked notion comes to your head and the internet?ôs breezy figurative ether will sweep it away before it has time to leave any real impact. That?ôs why it?ôs so popular with teenagers, I daresay.
So why would creators need this kind of impermanence? I understand the need to make micro-updates ??maybe what you?ôre working on isn?ôt significant enough to require a vlog, or a lengthy text post. But you want to offer your patrons something. A small visual update keeps everyone satisfied you?ôre on task, and is neither complicated nor time-consuming to produce.
But if you make the Lens updates more permanent, then you get a natural, unedited timeline of events for patrons to review. Just because something is raw and imperfect doesn?ôt mean it needs to be ephemeral.
There is some positive news, though: Patreon Lens apparently won?ôt have anything goofy like a filter system (I should add a ?úyet'??here just to cover my bases).

That?ôs all the company is saying for now, but it?ôll be interesting to see what it brings to the table, as the name Mario Kart Tour indicates that it?ôll likely be a brand new title instead of a port of Nintendo?ôs previous racing games. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which first launched on the Wii U, sold at least 5 million copies of its version for the Switch.

Google Flights is rolling out more information on flight delays, including more information on why your departure was actually held back, and even predicting if a delay may happen before you hear anything from your airline. You just need to search your flight number or route and airline to get the information.
Google says it?ôs using historic flight data and machine learning to predict delays, and it will only alert you if its more than 80 percent confident in its guess. You won?ôt want to risk that extra 20 percent, but it could at least give you some peace of mind if you were already running late. You can use the extra time to download a movie while you wait.
In related news, Google flights will also now be more transparent about what benefits are included with your particular ticket. If you book a basic economy ticket, you?ôll know that it doesn?ôt include options like overhead storage or the ability to pick your seat.

It?ôs presently only available for Android to users in Australia, and has been labeled an ?òexperiment,??so it isn?ôt yet clear whether it?ôll arrive on other platforms and in other countries.
For now, Stations seems like it?ôs designed to help you get music on your speakers with minimal effort: instead of searching for artists and albums, you simply pick from a range of playlists, labeled by genre. Mashable notes that you?ôll also find Spotify?ôs Release Radar and Discover Weekly playlists in there.
Plus, liking songs to indicate what you?ôre into will unlock personalized stations. However, you can?ôt skip songs or curate your own playlists by adding tracks.
It?ôll be interesting to see if Stations gains steam, as it could allow Spotify to compete with the likes of Pandora and bring in ad revenue, without having to charge new users.
Personally, I prefer being able to choose songs, discover artists individually, and listen to albums in their entirety, so it doesn?ôt sound like Stations is for me. But it could certainly appeal to folks who want to tune into something right quick, or set the mood for a party without much fuss.

232,apps,"Facebook?ôs feet are being held to the fire again ??this time, its being criticized by those hoping to protect children.
Child advocacy group Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC) today wrote an open letter to Facebook?ôs Mark Zuckerberg today in which they outlined their objections to Facebook?ôs child-centered app, Messenger Kids. The letter has been signed by more than 100 organizations and individuals.
The CCFC wraps up the letter by asking Facebook to delete Messenger Kids, but let?ôs be realistic ??Facebook?ôs not going to do that.
The company is desperate to pull in the previously-untapped audience of under-13s before the next Snapchat does, and it?ôs not going to give up the easy sell of a kid-friendly alternative.
My colleague Bryan has already pointed out Facebook, for all its nice language about appealing to children, Facebook comes across more like it?ôs trying to indoctrinate a younger, more malleable audience. It?ôs not the first company to try it, nor is it likely to be the last, especially on social media.
That said, and despite the downsides the letter cites, the CCFC also acknowledges there is a niche for online messengers:
We understand that not all relationships can be face-to-face. One of Facebook?ôs stated rationales for creating Messenger Kids is to help kids connect with long-distance family members, including parents in the military. But talking to family and friends over long distances doesn?ôt require a Messenger Kids account. Kids can use parents??Facebook, Skype, or other accounts to chat with relatives. They can also just pick up a phone.
So a space for juvenile social messaging exists ??it?ôs just for ?úother accounts??to fill, rather than Facebook. But why not Facebook?
There is a compromise between ?údeleting Messenger Kids??and ?úchanging nothing about Messenger Kids at all.??If Facebook is interested in meeting child welfare groups midway, here?ôs a good way it can start: Limit the amount of time kids spend on the app.
For example, have the app allow the child only a couple of hours a day, or a certain number of messages. Then the app locks until a parent unlocks it and/or grants the child more time or messages to use. Then you?ôve got an app that?ôs both kid-friendly and a tool for discipline.
A Messenger spokesperson said in a statement:
Since we launched in December we?ôve heard from parents around the country that Messenger Kids has helped them stay in touch with their children and has enabled their children to video chat with fun masks with family members near and far. For example, we?ôve heard stories of parents working night shifts being able read bedtime stories to their children, and moms who travel for work getting daily updates from their kids while they?ôre away.
As much as I?ôd like to side entirely with the parents on this, I think hoping Facebook will abandon its efforts to snare kids is fruitless ??and there is a way to keep the relationship between children and social media relatively healthy, provided both sides are willing to compromise.

233,apps,"Most people stick with whatever default browser came with their phone, be it Safari or Chrome. That?ôs a shame, because there are a lot of compelling options out there, like Cake Browser, which re-imagines how search can work on mobile.
Cake Browser?ôs genius is that it makes a single assumption: most times when you search for something, the first result is the one you actually care about. So, why don?ôt you just go to that, rather than look at a page of results, the majority of which you don?ôt care about?
That?ôs basically how Cake Browser works. After you type your query and hit ?òreturn?? it takes you to the first result Google (or Bing. Cake Browser isn?ôt picky) returns. If that?ôs not what you?ôre looking for, you just have to swipe right until you reach the result you want.

All that swiping fees slightly reminiscent of Tinder, don?ôt you think?
As you?ôd expect, searching for ?úThe Next Web??with Cake Browser takes you to our homepage. Swipe right, and you?ôll see three of the top news stories we?ôve published. From what I can tell, these are the top three stories shown in Google?ôs results, rather than ones specifically selected by the app.
After that, you?ôre taken to TNW?ôs Tech subcategory, which is easily one of the most active categories on the site in terms of reporting. The subsequent two results are our Facebook and Flickr pages.

Cake Browser?ôs novel approach to search feels slicker than the Exxon Valdez, and is vastly less exhausting than perpetually dipping in-and-out of Google results in order to find the page you care about.
Another thing: Cake Browser pre-loads pages before you actually open them. When you search for something, it?ôll automatically cache the first three results. As you swipe through, it?ôll continue to automatically pre-load subsequent results, so you aren?ôt left twiddling your thumbs waiting for the page to appear on your screen.
This worked really well for me, both on LTE and Wi-Fi. That said, I note that I live in a city with excellent 4G coverage, and I deliberately pay for a phone plan with a generous data allowance. I wonder how useful I?ôd find Cake Browser if that wasn?ôt the case.
It?ôs also worth noting that Cake Browser lets you search for things besides websites. You can choose to refine your query to just videos, shopping, images, or news.
These work a little differently, and don?ôt take you immediately to the top result. When I looked up ?úDeadpool??under the shopping category, it didn?ôt take me to the Blu-Ray of Deadpool on Amazon, but rather to to Google Shopping.

I swiped right and hit Amazon, but only Amazon?ôs search results. And then Wal-Mart?ôs results. You get the idea.
Similarly, if you search for ?úDespacito??under videos, you don?ôt go straight to the Latin toe-tapper, but instead the first page of YouTube?ôs results.
I?ôd love it if Cake Browser came with a feature that told it to head straight to the first search result, regardless of the category you?ôre searching in. Alas, I couldn?ôt find that anywhere.
These are minor bugbears. The bulk of all search results I make are for web pages, and not videos or products. Overall I found Cake Browser to be a time-saver. I?ôd type my query, and about 90 percent of the time I?ôd immediately get the result I was interested in.
Admittedly, the UI feels a bit clunky, but that?ôs easy to forgive when you consider it?ôs still early days for scrappy new browser. At this nascent stage, you?ôd except it to be a bit rough around the edges.
The company quietly launched Cake Browser in Australia and Taiwan in October, and has now released it worldwide across Android and iOS.
The company has also announced a $5 million pre-Series A funding round, lead by Peak Ventures and with Pelion Venture Partners and Kickstart Seed Fund also taking part, in order to bring its browser vision to full fruition.

235,apps,"London-based startup Smarter Time has an ambitious goal: it wants to make it easier to keep tabs on your day-to-day activities, so you can completely optimise your routine, and spend more time on the things you actually care about. 
To do that, the company has created an Android app that does much of the hard work for you. Based on your location and your previous activities, the app makes a guess at what it is you?ôre doing. So, if you?ôre in an office building from 9 to 5, it?ôll assume you?ôre hard at work. 
If you walk along a certain route, and you tell the app you?ôre walking your dog, it?ôll learn from this, and use the information as it goes forward. 
It can also look at your phone?ôs information, in order to track what you?ôre up to. So, if you?ôre messing around with Facebook, or binging Rick and Morty on Netflix, it?ôll know. It can also track your call logs, so you can see how long you?ôre actually spending on meetings. 

It also offers a Mac and Windows app that does a similar thing. It tracks what you?ôre doing, and uses the data to build your daily profile.
The aim is to allow users to exercise discipline in their life. If you want to learn to play an instrument, it might be useful to know how much time you?ôre wasting watching movies, browsing Reddit, or spending down the pub. 
Anna Winterstein, the company?ôs founder and CMO, spoke to TNW a few months ago. According to Winterstein, the company plans to stick with Android for the foreseeable future. That?ôs because iOS doesn?ôt allow apps the same level of granular access to live user data. Recreating the same experience across platforms simply isn?ôt tenable.
I?ôve spent the past few months playing around with Smarter Time. It?ôs an ambitious concept, and once I?ôve had a great deal of fun experimenting with. Its biggest weakness is that it relies on user discipline in order to work. For Smarter Time to actually be good at tracking what you?ôre up to, you need to (at least, at first) be willing to spoon-feed it your daily routine. 
At first, the app will make some pretty sketchy guesses. That?ôs often because indoor GPS signals (it uses location data extensively) are seldom precise. You need to be disciplined, and make sure you proactively correct Smarter Time when it errs. 
At first, that?ôs a bit of a nightmare. Things get easier as you use it more though. Given that Smarter Time is aimed at those who want to add a bit of discipline into their routine, that probably isn?ôt much of a hard sell. However, if you?ôre as scatterbrained as I am, you might struggle with it. 
In the interests of full disclosure, I have to admit I really struggled here, and I feel as though I didn?ôt get as much out of someone who would approach Smarter Time with a sense of military discipline.
My only other major criticism of the app is that it?ôs pretty taxing when it comes to battery life. I used it primarily on my BlackBerry KEYone (although in the pictures above, it?ôs running on a Xiaomi Mi Pad 3), and found that it cut my phone?ôs otherwise sterling stamina by about a quarter. That?ôs because it?ôs constantly awake, and constantly pinging your location services. 
One of Smarter Time?ôs strongest features is that it?ôs private by design. Data is stored on the phone. If you pay for the premium version, it?ôs uploaded to the cloud, where it sits in a form that?ôs entirely unreadable to Smarter Time. While they can do backups, they can?ôt do any analysis of the data. 
That?ôs pretty laudable, considering the company could probably make a shed-load of money by selling it. They?ôve signed up 100,000 users, who are using the app to build detailed records of their life, which are attached to a personal profile. Imagine how valuable that would be to a marketer.

236,apps,"Having had the pleasure of working with TNW full-time for over three years now, I?ôve accumulated more email in my work inbox than I ever thought I?ôd receive in a lifetime. I remember trying to develop good habits to keep it clean back when I started here, but they were all in vain ??and now I?ôve got some 70,000 messages taking up more than 70 percent of my allotted 30GB of G Suite storage.
I?ôve devised a number of search filters to help with all that unwanted mail, but Gmail isn?ôt designed for triaging messages in such large volumes ??not easily, anyway. Thankfully, there?ôs a better way, and it?ôs called CleanEmail.
It?ôs been around for a bit, and works with Gmail, G Suite, iCloud, Yahoo, Outlook, Fastmail, and anything that plugs in via IMAP. The web app provides you with a dashboard to easily sift through your inbox, with several ways of filtering emails so you can decide which ones to chuck.

For example, the Quick Clean tab told me that I had nearly 30,000 messages that were older than two years, and taking up 6.6GB of space. With a couple of clicks, you can have CleanEmail archive, trash or label them, and do so with any other messages that match this criterion in the future. It also spots newsletters, and notifications from social networks and project management apps like Slack. I?ôve never had an easier time clearing out entire gigabytes??worth of email until now.
Since this is my work inbox, I?ôm wary of running the tool willy-nilly, as I could lose important messages that I might need later. You can prevent that from happening by listing specific email addresses that you write to or receive messages from so that the app knows to avoid them while cleaning up. Similarly, you can set it to skip messages by label, or by time sent/received.

CleanEmail is far better at clearing my inbox of clutter than I am when I try to do so manually. It?ôs a bit expensive at $10 a month per account, but you could probably get away with using it for that long just once a year. There are plans for five and 10 accounts which are far more economical if you split the cost with friends and family. Oh, and the company says it doesn?ôt access your email contents (just the headers), and doesn?ôt analyze or sell your data. That?ôs worth paying for.
Sound like your cup of tea? Give CleanEmail a go by visiting the company?ôs site. The first 1,000 emails you clean up are on the house.

237,apps,"The twisted family tree of social media grew a new branch this week as Bloomberg reported Twitter was working on a new video feature which appeared to take its cues from Snapchat.
According to Bloomberg, Twitter is working on a new tool which will make it easier for users to share videos, and explicitly compares it to Snapchat. The report does?ôt say if Twitter is planning to add anything like ephemeral updates, Snapchat?ôs signature feature. Twitter has recently pushed to make its app easier to use, including releasing rather cringeworthy tutorial videos. Now it?ôs reportedly trying to make video sharing easier.
Judging by what they?ôve described, it honestly sounds more like Instagram than Snapchat ??it?ôs designed to decrease the number of button presses when a user wants to share a video, which is a shortcut Instagram eliminated ages ago by putting a big button in the center that leads right to the camera. But Instagram took a lot of inspiration from Snapchat in the first place, which is famous for having the camera front and center, so who even knows who?ôs related to whom anymore?
In the years its been around, Snapchat?ôs features have been ripped off left, right, and center. But has it ever actually worked for any social media site other than Instagram? Facebook, WhatsApp, and Skype have not changed significantly after getting Snap-like features bolted on. If Twitter does mimic any of Snapchat?ôs core features, they probably won?ôt add much.

240,apps,"Nintendo announced today that it?ôs shuttering Miitomo, its first foray into mobile that launched in March 2016.
More of a social app than a game, Miitomo allows users to create a digital avatar in their likeness (with the help of their phones??front camera), answer a few BuzzFeed-quiz-style questions, and interact with friends in a virtual environment.
The idea behind the service was to help people get to know their friends better, as the virtual characters exchanged facts about each other. Within a month of launching in Japan, the US and Europe, it had racked up four million users.
Miitomo will wind down for good on May 9 ??but before that, you?ôll be able to grab some bonus coins and game tickets to spend in the virtual universe, where you can play minigames, dress up your Mii avatar, and customize your room with a wide range of furniture and decor.

241,apps,"Apple has released a beta of the next version of iOS ??v11.3 ??to developers today, and listed a bunch of new features that the update will bring. Here are the ones worth looking out for.
The first is a fix for its performance throttling, which Apple was called out for last month. Essentially, if the battery in your iOS device is aging, the operating system would automatically slow performance down; Apple explained this was a measure to prevent unexpected reboots and freezes.
With iOS 11.3 on an iPhone 6 or newer, you?ôll be able to see detailed battery health information in Settings, as well as turn off this automatic performance throttling. The company doesn?ôt recommend it, but it?ôs good to have control over that functionality (which should have been included earlier anyway).
Next, Business Chat will let you message businesses directly for things like support, scheduling appointments, and paying for purchases with Apple Pay. The company announced it at last year?ôs WWDC event, and is trialing it with the likes of Lowe?ôs, Discover, Hilton, and Wells Fargo.

That?ôs similar to WhatsApp?ôs new service ??but with the added benefit of being able to make payments. But Apple will need to sign up enough companies onto its platform if it really wants people to use the new feature, so we?ôll probably have to give it a few months before judging how useful Business Chat can be.
Finally, the Health app will now let you view your personal health records, sourced from hospitals and clinics that you?ôve visited. You?ôll also receive notifications for their lab results, medications, and conditions from these facilities, and lock the data with a passcode.
There are some smaller niceties as well, like new animoji, ad-free music videos in Apple Music, and better mapping of walls and irregularly shaped surfaces, such as circular tables, in ARKit for improved augmented reality experiences.
The developer beta is available to folks who have signed up to Apple?ôs paid program, which costs $99 a year; you can sign up for that here.
Alternatively, you can hold out a bit for the public beta which should launch soon, and get on that for free by signing up to the company?ôs Beta Software Program. When the public version becomes available, you?ôll be able to download it from the same site. Of course, you?ôll want to first back up your data before trying this out.

The site now has multilingual word embedding, which it says is 20 to 30 times faster than the natural language processing it had been using. Up to now, Facebook says translating for a new language took almost as long as building a new application. Now it uses language vectors which group words with the same meaning together.
According to Facebook, more efficient translation is not only helpful for the obvious reason, but because it means Facebook can release features more swiftly, since it doesn?ôt have to wait as long for translations. It?ôs also using its multilingual embeddings to detect policy-violating content that might otherwise slide under the radar. Since the new machine translation raised accuracy to 95 percent, it means Facebook?ôs detection systems can more easily spot intent and purpose behind non-English posts.
At present, Facebook says it?ôs working on translating idioms and other cultural nuances that might not cross the barrier quite so easily. At present, it?ôs using multilingual embedding with success on German, French, and Spanish, and it?ôs working to bring the same embedding to the other 100 or so languages available to Facebook users.

Available for Android, it simply requires you to key in your message (and add a picture, if you like), choose your recipients from your contact list, and set a time for when you want your text to be sent.

Now, you?ôve got a couple of options: you can either have an SMS sent automatically at the time you?ôve specified, or you can have the app prompt you at said time to choose which other messaging app you?ôd like to use.
After you?ôre done lining up your message, Scheduled will prompt you at your specified time with a notification to choose which messaging app you?ôd like to use to send your text. Pick one from the list, and it?ôll fire it off as painlessly as possible.
There?ôs also an option to have your message sent out automatically at the specified time, but that only works with SMS, owing to the limitations stipulated by other apps. You?ôll also find that sending these messages via WhatsApp requires an extra step when compared to, say, Telegram, and again, that?ôs down to the way the messaging service works.
Still, it?ôs incredibly handy for when you want to remind people about something, check in on a loved one, or greet your contacts on special occasions. Speaking of which, Scheduled includes a neat feature to import your contacts??birthdays so you can ping people on the day with minimal effort.
Oh, and it can also duplicate texts ??either automatically when you choose a periodical repeat option, or manually when you swipe left on a message in the list of scheduled texts.
Scheduled is almost entirely free to use with ads, save for the auto-send SMS feature which you can unlock with a monthly in-app subscription of $1 (yes, it also removes ads). If you text a lot to keep in touch, that seems like a fair asking price for a tool that works with several services, looks good, and is dead-simple to use.

244,apps,"When I heard about Arianna Huffington?ôs new Thrive app for Samsung, available on Android, I thought what any rational person in control of their own lives would: this is stupid. Who needs an app that stops you from accessing your other apps?
After using it for a couple of days, however, I?ôm sad to say that I need this app. In fact, I think a lot of us do. Not everyone with a phone addiction is suffering from it, some of us think we?ôre doing just fine, thank you very much. Thrive changed my mind really quickly.
Arianna Huffington described what the consequences of device addiction are in an email to TNW:
They?ôre very real, and they?ôre increasing. We now have enough data to begin seeing what being always-on and hyper-connected is doing to us. And, as the science shows, the dangers are real: overexposure to technology damages our connections with ourselves and with others. And there?ôs an increasing amount of research showing even greater dangers for our children. It?ôs a challenge we?ôre going to have to deal with, and 2018 is going to be pivotal.
In order to review the app properly, I installed it on the phone I use for everything. And I decided to try and use it the way I imagined someone who needs it would. If this comes off as haughty, that?ôs because it was ??which I lament. When I downloaded Thrive I was under the impression I?ôd be hating on it.
It?ôs incredibly simple and straightforward. It has ?úThrive Mode??which blocks all notifications for a set amount of time. You can set up an auto-reply to let people know that it?ôs Arianna Huffington?ôs fault you?ôre not responding. And you can set up VIPs whose messages will come through no matter what.
Also featured in Thrive is app control and microsteps. The former lets you set daily limits on any of your apps that, upon being reached, block you from using them until 12 AM. And the latter is a set of ?úsmall, science-backed behavior changes you can incorporate into your daily life today for greater well-being.??They?ôre essentially fortune-cookie sized suggestions you can implement into your life to help you control habits.
If you?ôre too anxious to keep ?úthriving??you can cancel it, but if you?ôre really dedicated you can enter ?úSuper Thrive Mode??which cuts you off from using apps ??with the exception of emergency calls ??until a specified time, and you can?ôt just back out of it. It?ôs almost unfathomable ??who turns off their phone on purpose?
I actually wrote an article that stopped just short of asking people to avoid apps like this, because I was of the opinion that manners and self-discipline were all any of us really needed. I disliked the idea of setting scheduled times where email and messages were off-limits. It?ôs probably time for a healthy heaping of humble pie. But, the issue isn?ôt an easy one to tackle.
I?ôm a busy guy right? Don?ôt some of us have deadlines and work-emergencies that require us to be ready to respond even in our off hours? I can quit any time I want.
That?ôs a problem. Becoming better at compartmentalization isn?ôt a solution, I?ôve since learned. Priorities are important but I think (for myself at least) the biggest problem is commitment. I don?ôt want to use my phone when I?ôm down on the floor playing with my toddler, but the blinking green LED could indicate something important. What?ôs a quick glance going to hurt?
Our US Editor, Bryan Clark, wrote about the problem in a different way:
When you lift your phone to check email, chances are your browsing doesn?ôt stop there. I might open my phone to check email, but once I?ôm done I almost always find myself on Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, or Instagram. If you?ôre anything like me, you might start doing one thing on your smartphone, but an hour later you?ôre doing something else entirely, all under the guise of ?úchecking email real quick.??
Fear of missing out (FOMO) anxiety is real, but I haven?ôt been acknowledging the power it has over me. It only took using Thrive twice to convince me I had a problem. After failing to make it to 10 minutes both times I realized I should probably re-think my phone useage.

Through the THRIVE App, we can make technology work for us?îand ensure that we value recharging and focusing just as much as we value staying updated and informed.
I?ôm not gonna lie; turning on ?úThrive Mode??feels a little dorky. As a technology journalist it feels like a tiny betrayal to press a button that, basically, turns off the most important piece of technology in my life. But I?ôd rather feel a little dorky than miss out on my kid growing up.

The result is such that texts might appear in a totally different order for various participants in the same conversation.
You can check out these screenshots from a chat between TNW?ôs editor-in-chief Alejandro and editorial community manager Georgina; the images ought to give you a better idea of what the issue is. For the sake of clarity, Georgina took the first screenshot, while Alejandro provided the second one:
As you will notice, the same messages appear in the same chat ??but for some reason, both users see them in a different order.
The discrepancy in order is even more evident in the feature image above, where I?ôve marked each corresponding message with a respective color.
The issue appears to be pretty widespread, with some miffed users discussing it on Twitter:
Is there a widespread iMessage ordering bug that's happening? It's messing up order of texts on a single device I am having with one person, after they are delivered.

While it remains unclear what is causing this glitch, numerous users have taken to the Apple support forums to report the same issue. According to the records, the bug dates as far back as December last year; though it does seem more and more users are noticing the issue this month.
Some posters have commented that rebooting your iPhone seems to put all texts in the correct order ??still, that hardly qualifies as a legitimate solution.
Then there are also a couple of one-off complaints about the same issue dating back to late 2014 and early 2015.

246,apps,"Although WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are the two most popular messaging apps, ultra-secure encrypted alternatives like Signal and Telegram are both growing rapidly. They?ôre niche, but they offer privacy-oriented features that are attractive to those concerned about confidentiality, or living in regimes where surveilance is all-encompasing.
Boston-based app analytics firm Apptopia took a look at user growth numbers for Signal and Telegram for those living in corrupt regimes. The firm contrasted the five most and least corrupt countries, according to Transparency International. In these corrupt countries, Apptopia found monthly active user (MUA) growth massively outstrips that from countries perceived as least corrupt.

Signal saw users from the corrupt group of countries soar by 147 percent. In countries that are less corrupt, monthly active users growth was just 11 percent. Apptopia says that Signal saw the majority of its 2017 growth from countries at the top of Transparency International?ôs Corruption Perception Index list.
Telegram also saw increased growth from corrupt countries. In 2017, it saw a 118 percent rise in users from the top corrupt countries. Users from the least corrupt countries grew by 99 percent. That?ôs a difference of 19 percent. It?ôs not as stark as the chasm shown by Signal, but it?ôs still pretty big.
The countries in the corrupt group are Venezuela, Nigeria, Kenya, Russia, and the Ukraine. The least corrupt countries in Transparency International?ôs list are Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, Finland, and New Zealand.
There?ôs a lot to unpack here. Many of the countries in the corrupt group have a distinctly authoritarian bent. According to Freedom House?ôs Freedom In The World 2017 list, Russia and Venezuela are not free, while Nigeria, Kenya, and the Ukraine are only partly free. This could be a major driver of the growth.
It?ôs also worth pointing out that Telegram has its origins in Russia, where people are often willing to give home-grown alternatives a chance. In Russia, social network giant VKontakte offers Facebook stiff opposition. Yandex has outpaced Google in the Russian search market, while mail.ru is one of the most successful webmail providers in the country.
For what it?ôs worth, Apptopia doesn?ôt ascribe any particular phenomenon for the growth of Signal and Telegram in these nations. It merely notes that there?ôs a distinct link between perceptions of corruption, and the use of privacy-protecting messaging apps.

247,apps,"Stories are a huge part of Snapchat, and now the company is making it easier to share them with people who don?ôt have the app.
Not every story can be shared outside the app. The feature only works for Official Stories, unpartnered Our Stories, and Search Stories.
This needs a bit of explanation. So, official Stories are more visible, and come from a handful of selected Snapchat users. In the UK, that includes the likes of Dua Lipa, Rita Ora, Stormzy, and talk-show host and We Buy Any Car pitchman, Phillip Schofield.
Our Stories are hand-curated stories from specific events. So, for example, Snapchat might pick some stories from a music festival or gig. Search Stories are far simpler; these appear in organic search traffic when using the app.
With me so far? Good. If it sounds confusing, that?ôs because it is. For whatever reason, Snapchat has allowed Stories to become fractured and complicated, but I digress??
It?ôs worth mentioning that these stories have different longevities, for lack of a better word. Official Stories can be viewed outside of Snapchat for just 24 hours. The other two last longer, and stay up for a whole 30 days.
That?ôs a little surprising considering Official Stories come from influencers (again, for lack of a better word), and will probably be of greater interest to the Snapchat community than someone tripping on magic mushrooms at Glastonbury.
To share a story, just hold its tile and tap ?úShare Story.??You can share this via text message, email, or on other social platforms. Recipients view it through the snapchat.com.
Oh, another thing. This isn?ôt available to everyone. Only those with the new, redesigned Snapchat will get this. The company says it intends to roll out the controversial new redesign to more users over the following few weeks.
If you?ôre curious about the new Snapchat design, watch this video from Miranda Kerr?ôs husband, who explains it in just 60 seconds.

With Snapchat hungry for growth, this gambit could pay off, and could work as a gateway drug to the rest of the product.
On the flipside, it could backfire spectacularly. Snapchat?ôs decision to unleash stories outside of the app could have the same consequences as Facebook opening the floodgates to anyone without a ??edu??address.
In short, it might push uncool, decrepid ?òolds??into signing up, much to the chagrin of their millennial children. And then what will happen?
Yeah, it might boost user numbers, but it may have serious ramifications for any ?òcool factor??Snapchat has.

250,apps,"Norwegian (well, technically Chinese) browser maker Opera has introduced cryptojacking protections to its family of mobile browsers ??Opera for Android and Opera Mini.
Cryptojacking is where websites (quite often centered around porn and file sharing) embed cryptocurrency mining scripts in their code. While the user remains on the page, these covertly generate digital coins, like Monero.
Generating these coins is extremely resource intensive, however. There are several major user-experience downsides. Those with a cryptojacking website open inevitably find their systems rendered excruciatingly sluggish, and tasks taking longer to complete.
On phones, the issues are compounded. Users can expect measurably worse battery life. They may also find their devices start to overheat, as the phone attempts to keep up with the mathematical calculations required to mine cryptocoins.
?úWhen you browse the web, there are no visual clues that your device is exposed to mining,??said Jan Standal, VP Product Marketing at Opera, in an emailed statement. ?úA single webpage you visit can take up to 4.5 hours of your battery time, if you keep the tab open. This often turns out to be just the battery time you needed to use a ride-hailing app or check the map to get home??
On both Opera Mini and Opera for Android, users can activate the cryptojacking protections by heading into ?òsettings,??and switching on the browser?ôs built-in adblocker.
To check that it works, you can visit this website launched by the company to test the vulnerability of browsers to cryptocurrency mining.

Opera introduced cryptojacking countermeasures to its desktop browser earlier this month. The feature is available starting from Opera 50, and is activated in much the same way: by turning on the integrated adblocker.

255,apps,"Following murmurs from last April about WhatsApp gearing up to allow payments in India, FactorDaily reports that Facebook employees in the country are presently testing the new functionality in the messaging app, and that the company plans to begin testing it with about 1 percent of its user base there within the first quarter of this year.
That means that the Facebook-owned service will soon go up against numerous major players in India?ôs crowded mobile payments space. Built on the country?ôs Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which allows for instant money transfers between bank accounts at no charge, it?ôll have to compete with Google?ôs Tez, local wallet service Paytm, and the government?ôs own BHIM app, among others.
The news comes on the heels of WhatsApp?ôs launch of its new app that lets businesses message customers on the platform. However, FactorDaily?ôs source noted that only peer-to-peer payments are being tested on the messaging service at present, and tools for transacting with merchants haven?ôt been enabled.
Beyond building the tech to support payments, it?ôs possible that WhatsApp is also attempting to tackle the challenges of setting up customer support channels for its payment solution, as well as looking for ways to deal with the fact that UPI-based transactions need to be audited by India?ôs banking regulator ??which doesn?ôt gel well with the service?ôs promise of end-to-end encryption for conversations.
WhatsApp will also likely need to figure out how to get merchants to use its platform to receive payments from customers, because that?ôs where the money is.
Now, about the competition: Google?ôs Tez, which launched in India last September, is getting a major update that will let users pull up their bills from service providers for things like electricity and broadband connections, and pay them off from within the app. When the company announced the upcoming functionality last month, it noted that it was closing in on 12 million users nationwide, and that it accounted for 73 percent of all UPI-based payments in November 2017.
Paytm has 280 million registered users on its platform, and has lots more on offer already. In addition to its digital wallet which works with a wide range of services including Uber, it also runs a payments bank that lets you open a savings account right from your phone. It also also allows for UPI-based transactions, as well as shopping from a multi-vertical store in its app, and recently bolted on a messaging service.
For its part, WhatsApp has a large base of 200 million users in India, which is a good place to be. But it?ôll have its work cut out for it in building the additional functionality and partnerships required to compete with the aforementioned players.

Smart Reply is already available in certain Google apps, like Inbox, Gmail, and Allo. Now, 9to5Google has spotted code that details the inclusion of this feature in an upcoming version of Gboard for Android, which leads us to believe that, based on the contents of your screen, it?ôll suggest contextually relevant phrases that you can use to reply with, just by tapping once instead of having to type.
Since it?ôs still sorta in the works, we can?ôt yet see what the feature will look in Gboard. But for reference, here?ôs how Smart Reply works in Gmail:

The blog noted that the feature is being built to work with a bunch of messaging apps, including Hangouts, Android Messages, Allo, Facebook Messenger and Messenger Lite, WhatsApp, Snapchat, and Tencet.
I?ôm all for features that reduce the need to type, and allow you to operate apps with just one hand. I wrote last year about how Smart Reply in Gmail helped me respond to five times more emails than before; beyond just negating the need to type, it also slashed the amount of time I spent thinking about how to word my replies, and whether it?ôs okay to respond with a more concise message than usual (pro tip: it is).
I?ôd be glad to see Smart Reply come to Gboard, because I?ôve got contacts on a bunch of different messaging services. It?ôd be great to see this support other tools like Telegram and Slack as well; I?ôve got faith in Ray Kurzweil, the technologist responsible for building the tech for this feature over at Google.
The code for Smart Reply was first found in version 6.9 of Gboard for Android; it?ôs worth noting that the feature may not become available immediately, as Google may want to test it with some users before releasing it to everyone (a beta version version available to sideload from APKMirror didn?ôt show any Smart Reply-related options in the Settings).  Hopefully, we won?ôt have to wait too long before our keyboard can do our texting for us.

Private shared channels can be public on one end and private on another, or private on both, depending on company needs. Admins will also get a new, consolidated menu from which to manage shared channels, create new ones, and stop sharing existing channels at any time.

261,apps,"David Marcus, head of Facebook?ôs Messenger, today announced one of the company?ôs 2018 plans for the chat app is to simplify it. What is primarily supposed to be a messaging app has become, to use his word, ?úcluttered.??
It?ôs a good plan, considering Messenger has become weighed down with unnecessary add-ons. Here?ôs what Facebook needs to cut from Messenger.
When Marcus clarified Messenger?ôs status, he outright said the clutter began two years ago:
Over the last two years, we built a lot of capabilities to find the features that continue to set us apart. A lot of them have found their product market fit; some haven?ôt.
By sheer coincidence, I?ôm sure, two years ago is roughly the time Facebook began ripping features from Snapchat ??the most obvious one being Messenger Day, which has since been merged with Facebook?ôs main Stories feature.
If it really wants to declutter Messenger, then Facebook?ôs first job should be figuring out how the app fits into its larger scheme. If Instagram is the bite-sized visual life story app, and Facebook itself is the microblogging app, then Messenger is primarily for keeping in communication with your friends.
Presenting them with a visual gallery of your day isn?ôt suited to this purpose. Even the other features on this list are kind of in service to that goal (if you squint in some cases), but Stories definitely isn?ôt. Hopefully by now Facebook has realized that just because Snapchat does a thing doesn?ôt mean that thing has to be stuffed into all Facebook-branded apps.
One of the things Facebook has added steadily to Messenger over the last couple of years is extensions ??so many of them. It?ôs been drip-fed to Messenger so slowly that it isn?ôt until you take a step back that you realize just how much has now been added.
When you open Messenger, begin a message, and hit the Plus button, you?ôre taken to a menu with so many extensions that it?ôs dizzying. You can share your location live on a map, Spotify songs, or Food Network recipes. It?ôs all too much, more than Messenger needs.
None of the extensions on their own are bad things, but I question how often they?ôre actually used. When I see a Food Network recipe I like, for example, I usually just send a friend a URL rather than open the extension and find it. It?ôs an embarrassment of riches that feels difficult to spend.
I don?ôt mind Messenger games so much ??if we?ôre truly trimming the fat I think they should probably go too, but personally I don?ôt find them as tedious as some of the other features. Now livestreaming on the other hand??
Facebook announced Messenger game streaming via Facebook Live a month ago. As with the Stories feature above, I don?ôt see how this remotely ties into Marcus?ôs new goal to ?úmake Messenger the best way to spend time together when you?ôre apart.??If you must keep games in Messenger, then why try to make them broadcast affairs?
Not to mention the games themselves aren?ôt exactly watchable affairs. I?ôm all for having a Pac-Man and Angry Birds in Messenger, for the novelty if nothing else, but it?ôs not necessary to have them be available for a live stream.
And to end on a positive note, there?ôs one thing I think Facebook Messenger should keep:
This time last year, I?ôd have said it was a silly thing, to add a peer-to-peer payment option to Messenger of all things. But now that I?ôve had more time to reflect, I don?ôt think it?ôs such a bad idea.
At last count, Messenger had over 1 billion users. That?ôs a lot of people who use it. And I think enabling a way for friends to share a little cash is a good use of the app ??nowhere near as complicated/annoying as the above features and something I think every single one of those billion people could use.
Facebook Messenger is a hugely popular app, and it?ôs become a cornerstone of online social life, every bit as much as Facebook, or Twitter, or Snapchat. It?ôs good for Facebook to recognize the clutter is a problem. Improving Messenger will probably require quite a bit of trimming, even more than I?ôve specified here, but it?ôd help make the app more user-friendly.

262,apps,"Facebook recently announced a major change to its News Feed: Namely, that it was shifting away from brand and news posts and prioritizing what your friends and groups post.
This comes after Facebook spent several months being raked across the coals for its inability to police its fake news and propaganda??so it comes across as Facebook not fixing its own problems so much as giving up and excising the symptom completely. Even if Zuckerberg says he wants to bring Facebook back to its roots, it?ôs also a reaction to outside criticism, one that won?ôt necessarily fix Facebook?ôs news problems.
In an interview with Axios last October, Sheryl Sandberg insisted Facebook was ?únot a media company,??in that it didn?ôt have any journalists on staff. But that?ôs not all that makes a media company, and Facebook?ôs deflection rings a bit hollow considering a Pew study published just a month earlier says that a very large chunk of Americans are at least somewhat reliant on social media for news ??45 percent from Facebook specifically.
Since that?ôs the case, it?ôs a little high-handed to de-prioritize news. Imagine if 45 percent of American adults relied on Facebook for entertainment. Then, say some of them watched a documentary that fudged its facts, and made people believe things that weren?ôt true. And in response to criticism saying the company should do more to ensure the veracity of its content, the company decided to hide its entertainment section and said it was to ensure users were focusing on the more ?úimportant??task of bonding with family and friends. Not only does that sound condescending, it?ôs also an overreaction.
I highly doubt this is actually going to eliminate any of the news problems on Facebook. There will still be news stories of questionable veracity, only it?ôll be your friends sharing them rather than brands or news pages. All this change will do is shift the burden of away from Facebook.

Checkpoint?ôs report on the malware warns it shows pornographic ads which would obscure the actual game, including one featuring a picture of Kim Kardashian ??fittingly, the code is called AdultSwine. In some cases, the virus would prompt users to download fake anti-virus software. In others, it would try to trick them into entering their phone number.
According to Reuters, the ads appear in apps with titles aimed at kids, like ?úDrawing Lessons Lego Ninjago.??I?ôm assuming the thought process is that kids will mindlessly click on a pop-up if they think it will get them back to the game faster ??not that adults don?ôt do that, too.

267,apps,"Google is attempting to push its Duo voice and video calling app with a clever new Android feature: the ability to ring contacts who don?ôt have the app installed.
First spotted by Android Police, this works only with fellow Android users; there are some other limitations that keep your entire contact list from being available to call, but it?ôs unclear exactly what those are just now.
That could certainly help push Duo to more people ??but we?ôll have to wait and see if folks care to use it. Most users of major messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook Messenger already have access to voice and video calling, so it?ôs hard to say whether they?ôll find any reason to try another tool for the job.
Duo already comes preinstalled on certain brands of Android phones, including OnePlus. The new feature is made possible by a component in Google Play Services called App Preview Messaging that debuted in 2016, which the company previously used to allow users of its Allo messaging service to text their contacts through the app, even if the recipients didn?ôt have it installed.

269,apps,"So you?ôve enjoyed a lovely date; you?ôre sharing a cab home; things are going great. You suggest a nightcap and your companion agrees. There?ôs magic in the air, the sexual tension is at boiling point, and you?ôre both all set to do the deed. What better way to kill the vibe than to whip out an app on your phone to request consent?
That?ôs what LegalFling?ôs upcoming app is all about. With just a swipe, you?ôll be able to secure explicit consent before engaging in a sexual act with one or more persons, complete with a binding legal contract and a record of it on a blockchain.
Credit: LegalFling
LegalFling isn?ôt the first-ever consent app: there?ôs also SaSie and We-Consent?ôs suite of tools that have been around for a while. With this app, the Dutch developer LegalThings hopes to streamline the act of seeking consent, while also securing contracts with blockchain tech.
The app is slated to come with features like the ability to send a request for consent via popular messaging services like WhatsApp, options to set your boundaries and use it with a partner in a long-term relationship, as well as the ability to escalate a breach and send a cease-and-desist letter with a single tap (which sounds like something you might use in case you?ôve recorded your sexual activity with a camera, and your partner is sharing that content).
As Gizmodo correctly noted, a major problem with LegalFling?ôs proposed solution is that it doesn?ôt take into account the fact that granting consent is a continuous process that spans the entire duration of a sexual encounter; as such, signing a contract before the act doesn?ôt really make sense, and it certainly shouldn?ôt curtail your ability to withdraw your consent at any point.
Now, the site does say that saying ?úNo??at any time during the act will do the trick; your consent is also automatically null and void if you?ôre passed out. But the fact remains that granting consent, changing your mind, and communicating your feelings moment-to-moment are better expressed in person than through a digital contract. That?ôs not something you can improve upon with a blockchain.
As Stephanie Alys, co-founder of UK-based sex toy brand MysteryVibe noted at TNW Conference last year in her talk about sex and data, there?ôs a difference between seeking consent and seeking agreement ??and the latter is what you get when you hand someone a contract. Regardless of what actually holds up in court, the fact is that if you genuinely want your partner to be on board with engaging in sexual activity with you, a legal document isn?ôt the way to go.
Instead of tools to help you battle a legal case in the event that you?ôre accused of sexual misconduct ??because that?ôs what LegalFling sounds like right now ??we need ways to encourage more open conversations about what we?ôre consenting to, what we?ôre comfortable with in the bedroom, and with whom.

With its newly expanded beta test, the company is now one step closer to making GeForce Now widely available.
Nvidia promises smooth frame rates at high resolutions for games available from Steam and Uplay PC, with the added benefits of no install times or manual updates. There?ôs also an Ultra Streaming Mode that will reduce latency with higher-than-usual frame rates of 120fps and greater.
I can?ôt wait for this to launch globally: I suspect that for many gamers like myself, it?ôs easier to spend bandwidth on streaming titles than it is to buy and maintain a pricey gaming desktop computer.

276,apps,"Writers are fiercely loyal to the tools they use. For years, I swore by the ultra-slimline markdown editor iA Writer. Sadly, this hugely popular app is a macOS exclusive, and when I ditched my MacBook Pro to join the PC world, I had to leave it behind.
For ages now, I?ôve searched for a successor to iA Writer, and nothing has ever come close. That is, until I stumbled upon GhostWriter, which is available for Linux and Windows.
For the past month, I?ôve used it as my daily driver on Ubuntu 17.10. I compose almost all of my articles in it. Rather quickly, I?ôve become an enthusiastic fan.
GhostWriter bears a striking resemblance to iA Writer. Like iA Writer, it?ôs completely distraction free, with no bells and whistles to get in the way. It has a focus mode, which allows you to narrow your attention to a single line, paragraph, or sentence.
Another bonus is the inclusion of a ?úHemingway??mode, which disables the delete and backspace keys. This isn?ôt an idea unique to GhostWriter. Many writers swear by the idea that if you?ôre forced to write first and edit later, you?ôre ultimately more productive. You can find Hemingway modes in several other text editors, but GhostWriter is the first one where I?ôve actually used it.
Right at the bottom of the page is a word count, letting you see how far along you are into your oeuvre. Like iA Writer, GhostWriter also comes with an eye-saving night mode.
It?ôs reasonably customizable too. In addition to the usual visual tweaks, you can set the text width and change the font.
I?ôm a fickle person, and I flit between text editors a lot. Despite that, I feel pretty comfortable with GhostWriter, and I expect to use it for the foreseeable future.
That said, there are a few areas where GhostWriter leaves a lot to be desired. Its focus mode ??which is designed to keep you focused at the task at hand ??isn?ôt nearly as good as iA Writer. GhostWriter simply emphasizes the piece of text you?ôre working on, while iA Writer places it smack-bang in the middle of the screen, where it?ôs at eye-level.
I?ôm not sure if this is just a flaw with the Linux version of the app, but it also doesn?ôt really scale well on higher-resolution screens. My primary display is a 2K monitor, and both text and icons are really small.
The easiest workaround I found was to lower the resolution of my display to 1920√ó1080. Still, that?ôs not exactly ideal, is it?
I?ôve tried other distraction-free Linux markdown editors. I know UberWriter has fans, but when I used it, it didn?ôt really set my world on fire. .
I also spent November trying out Write, which has an enthusiastic fan in my colleague Abhimanyu. I liked it, but felt as though document management could be a little better, and it was a little too turbo-charged for my liking. It also didn?ôt properly scale on my monitor, which was frustrating considering it costs nearly $20.
Of course, if a Linux port of iA Writer ever came out, I?ôd probably throw great wads of cash at the screen, before promptly making it my default text editor. But until that day comes, I?ôm sticking with GhostWriter.
If you?ôve got a recommendation for a distraction-free text editor I should try, feel free to drop me an email here.

Developer Arnova8G2, who had previously ported the Pixel?ôs HDR+ feature to other Snapdragon-powered Android devices, managed to include portrait mode in the latest version of the app. That?ôs particularly notable because it means phones without a built-in portrait mode like the Galaxy S8, LG V30, and HTC U11 could use portrait mode without the need for a specialized depth-sensing setup.
Given the Pixel 2 uses a split pixel system to increase the accuracy of its depth map (on the rear camera), chances are this won?ôt work quite as well. On the other hand, it should at least hold up to the feature on the Pixel 2?ôs front-facing camera, which is quite great. We haven?ôt tried it ourselves, but so far the implementation looks pretty good from the sample images on XDA.

278,apps,"One of the best things about Android is how flexible its interface is: customizing your home screen to suit your usage habits and preferences only takes a few taps, and the possibilities are endless. Here are just a few choice examples of custom home screens from the Android theming community on Reddit:
How are these setups created? It?ôs usually a combination of carefully paired elements, and most of them are easily available from Google Play. Let?ôs look at all the things you can do to pretty up your Android interface with little to no effort.
You probably knew this already: you can switch up the background of your home screen by using just about any image stored on your device. The easiest way to do so is to find it in your gallery, whether that?ôs a wallpaper you downloaded or a photo from your camera, tap the options button, and choose ?òSet as?¶‚Ä?
Some versions of Android will let you set the image as either your home screen or lock screen; if you don?ôt see an option, it?ôll default to your home screen. For best results, you?ôll want to use images that are of the same or higher resolution than your screen. It?ôs worth noting that you don?ôt have to restrict yourself to portrait-orientation images; if you use a landscape-orientation image, you can scroll through its length as you move between home screens.
Wondering where to find beautiful wallpapers? Google Play has a ton of wallpaper apps that include hundreds of backgrounds ??often for free ??in a simple interface with categories and a shortcut to apply them. You?ôll want to start with either Google?ôs own Wallpapers app ??which includes a handy background rotation function ??or Backdrops, which comes with a fantastic selection of wallpapers that you won?ôt find anywhere else.
You can also look for wallpapers on Reddit: the community at r/androidthemes frequently shares quality backgrounds. Alternatively, search Google Images with a generic keyword and the exact resolution of your screen: here?ôs what you get when you look for backgrounds for a 1080p device.
Android also supports live wallpapers, which are animated or respond to your touches and swipes. While there are loads of these available on Google Play, you?ôll want to check their reviews to be sure that they don?ôt consume too much battery life. I prefer live wallpapers that feature subtle animations or visual effects. Here are some of my favorites:
If you?ôd like to generate your own wallpapers, give Tapet a go. It lets you browse through a wide range of patterns and apply various color schemes to them, with just a swipe. Once you?ôre happy with your creation, you can save and set the background as your wallpaper, or share it with a friend. The free version should keep you plenty busy, but you might want to pay and unlock the additional patterns available with the Premium tier.
Finally, there?ôs Muzei, a fantastic app that pulls in backgrounds from sources like Reddit and Unsplash and displays them with a bit of blur; double-tap the home screen and it?ôll clear right up for you to get a better look. Of course, you can choose to disable that effect if you like, but the blur does help your home screen icons and widgets stand out a bit more.
One of the things you?ôll notice in some of the best Android home screen setups is the consistency across the look of the backgrounds, widgets, and icons. The last bit is usually fairly easy to achieve, thanks to icon packs which generally follow a theme or visual style, and can be applied to all your apps at once.
There are plenty of high-quality icon packs available on Google Play either for free or a reasonable fee, and many of them come with thousands of icons to cover a wide range of apps. Whether you?ôre looking for minimalist monochrome icons or a splashy Material Design-inspired set, the Play store will leave you spoilt for choice.
Where should you start with icons? I personally prefer simple ones with a unified design language so as to keep my home screen nice and tidy, so I usually go with Lines, Min, Flight Lite, or TwoPixel.
For a more vibrant look, I?ôve taken a liking to Frozy, Perfect, Crispy, Phix, Darkmatter, Minimale, and Material Cards.
Pro tip: Many of these icon packs frequently go on sale or or are on offer for free for limited periods: you can track them by following the r/googleplaydeals subreddit.
Oh, and most of the better packs come with bundled wallpapers, so you don?ôt need to go scurrying around to find suitable backgrounds for your new icons. If you need more control over how your icons look, try Icon Pack Studio, which lets you create custom icons with your choice of colors, shape effects, and filters. There?ôs also MicoPacks, which helps you manage your icon packs all in one place, and even set them to change according to the time of day with Tasker.
It?ôs worth noting that icon packs work with launcher apps in order to be applied. Thankfully, most of them work with a wide range of launchers, so you don?ôt really have to worry about which one you choose to use. Which brings us to??
Launchers control your home screen?ôs behavior, allowing you to add icons, multiple ?òpages?? widgets, and so on. They?ôre the backbone of your Android?ôs interface, and there are loads to choose from. Of course, you might already be happy with the one that came with your phone, but it?ôs likely that it won?ôt be able to do some fun stuff, like apply icon packs.
That?ôs why it makes sense to consider installing a third-party launcher. Arguably the best ones on the market right now are Nova Launcher, and Action Launcher. While both offer plenty of functionality and flexibility, I?ôm partial to Nova mostly because I?ôve used it for ages and know its ins and outs ??but feel free to try the others available on Google Play, including the simpler Evie Launcher, and the information-packed Microsoft Launcher.
Setting up your launcher will require a bit of work depending on how finicky you are. Finicky?ôs my middle name, and so I usually head into Nova?ôs settings, add more pages and spaces to the dock so I can fit about 21 app shortcuts to that bottom row of icons on my screen, set the app drawer to display with just an upward swipe, and fiddle with all the color and transparency settings for the app drawer.
There?ôs plenty more you can do, such as customizing the grid size on your home screen so you can place icons closer together, configure how folders of icons are displayed, and adjust the animations for actions like opening the app drawer and scrolling through multiple pages on your home screen.
I like my setup to be clean and fuss-free, and I enjoy being able to see my wallpaper, so my setup only features icons on the dock. I?ôve also installed the Nova Google Companion so I can bring up the Google feed and search by swiping right, and I?ôve got another page on which I?ôve got my Google Keep notes and Google Calendar events widgets within easy reach.
I?ôve also configured a few gestures in Nova, so I can simply swipe down with two fingers to begin a voice recording with Easy Voice Recorder Pro, and swipe up to begin identifying a song with Shazam ??no additional icons necessary.
Here?ôs where you can really have some fun: most apps come with widgets that bring handy shortcuts and content from them right to your home screen (for example, Google?ôs note-taking service, Keep, lets you create different kinds of notes, and view your most recent ones without having to open the app).
Those are useful in their own right, but you can take things a step further to customize the look of your home screen with decorative widgets. There are loads of standalone widgets available in the Play store, but you might want to look into widget engines that not only support a huge variety of designs, but also let you customize them to suit your needs, and even create your own.
Of the lot of them, Kustom Widget Maker, aka KWGT, is the most popular widget engine available right now. It lets you load up widgets that you can download from Google Play, and allow you to import graphics, create shapes, and set actions for buttons and areas in which to display information from other apps like calendars and music players. In the image above, you can see three widgets on my home screen (a music player controller, a calendar, and a weather display), as well as Nova Launcher?ôs widget picker screen, followed by KWGT?ôs list of widgets, and its widget configuration screen.
To apply any widget, simply long-press on the home screen, head to the Widgets section, and choose a widget from any app you like. You?ôll need to press and hold on the widget before you can drop it somewhere on your home screen. Once you?ôve placed it, you can long-press on it again to resize, move or remove it.
Widget engines work a bit differently: you?ôll need to first drop in an empty widget on your home screen, and then tap that space to load up its contents. Let?ôs take Kustom as an example. Once you?ôve placed a KWGT widget on your homescreen (I usually go with 4√ó2 or 4√ó1 sizes), tap it to reveal the pre-installed widgets available, as well as those from third-party widgets (they?ôre automatically added to the list within KWGT?ôs engine).
Tap on one of them to bring it into the widget customization screen; if you?ôre happy with how it looks and scales within the widget area, hit the Save icon at the top of the screen, and you?ôre good
to go. You can tweak things like the information that?ôs displayed, or which app opens when you tap on the widget, but that might be a bit much for this piece. I?ôd recommend heading here for in-depth tutorials instead.
If you?ôre keen on even deeper customization, you can also try Kustom Live Wallpaper Maker, aka KLWP. The paid Pro version lets you load full-blown wallpaper-widget combos that completely overhaul your home screen with a functional background. That means that you don?ôt have to place widgets yourself; simply find a KLWP app or file, load it up through the engine, and you?ôll be treated to a whole new look and feel. Here?ôs an example I?ôm enjoying a lot right now:

It?ôs worth noting that this works with any launcher, but you?ôll want to hide your icons and widgets so they don?ôt overlay on top of the live wallpaper and ruin the look of your new home screen.
That?ôs a wrap, folks! You now know about all the different tools you need to customize your Android interface just so. For inspiration, tips, and downloads, head over to the r/androidthemes subreddit, where people post their own setups and share the necessary files you?ôll need to recreate the look on your own device.
We?ôd love to see your setups too! Share your creations on Instagram and Twitter by posting them with #TNWAndroid, and we?ôll publish our favorites in January 2018.
Pro tip: Use an app like Screener, AppWrap, or Google?ôs Device Art Generator to frame your screenshot with a phone surround for best results.
Happy theming!

279,apps,"2017?ôs list of new apps came with some real winners, and several of them we really enjoyed. To be clear, this isn?ôt a rundown of apps that were insanely popular this year. It?ôs a mix of ones we?ôve reviewed and others that were just really good. We think everyone should download at least one of these as a souvenir from this year.
I would have loved to put Super Mario Run or Pokemon GO on this list, but both were launched before the year actually began. Super Mario Run just squeaked by as a 2016 iOS app, in fact. But Nintendo did release another app from one of its most-popular franchises.

Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp is a social mobile game so popular it crashed the company?ôs server on both days. It doesn?ôt exactly have a story, but it does let you build and decorate your own
Built on Apple?ôs new ARKit, released with iOS 11, IKEA Place allows you to ??as the name suggests ??place IKEA furniture into your home via the magic of augmented reality.
Excuse me, I?ôm just laying out IKEA furniture on a subway platform #ARKit #iphone8plus pic.twitter.com/lECKVB4VQi
??Scott Stein (@jetscott) September 19, 2017

IKEA Place is one of the more useful ARKit apps out there. Not only does it give you the chance to visualize your furniture layout before you buy, it can also provide a few giggles when you pile furniture in odd places.
Our favorite productivity app from this year, Zenkit has emerged as competition for Trello. It?ôs your new to-do list, project tracker, and calendar all in one.

While the app doesn?ôt have all of the same features as its online counterpart, it does offer the productivity essentials, and that?ôs all most of us would need. It?ôs intended to be used as a companion to the online version.
A free video-editing app, Clips was Apple?ôs answer to Instagram and Snapchat ??meaning, it had filters, stickers, and other video effects. It also auto-generates captions.

The main draw of Clips is the fact that it offers these effects without tying the video to any particular social media platform. When you make the videos, you can save them to your phone and send them to your friends without having to upload them to Snapchat, Facebook, or Instagram.
The new trivia app from the creators of Vine, HQ has ballooned in popularity since it launched a few months ago. Hosted live and held at specific times throughout the day, the trivia contests cover everything from science to literature to history.

One of the biggest draws of the games is that they pay out actual money, and in the short time the app has been around, the prize amounts have increased dramatically ??some games now have a pot of $10,000 or more, which is parceled among the winners. On the bigger prize nights, the app drags under the weight of so many users, so I recommend checking on the nights when the stakes aren?ôt quite so high.
This game is a port of an acclaimed console game from last year, but that doesn?ôt make it any less of a special experience. The Witness is the kind of brain teaser that easily makes the transition to mobile without losing anything in translation.

Of course, calling these puzzles ?úbrain-teasers??might be underselling it a bit. The goal of the game is pretty simple: get from Point A to Point B and solve hundreds of puzzles along the way. You?ôll have to have a firm grasp of everything the game throws at you, including sights and sounds, in order to make headway.
My other favorite Nintendo offering, Fire Emblem Heroes has little in common with the aforementioned Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp aside from the parent company. Being based on the long-running tactical role-playing series, Heroes is a more of a challenge than its fluffier counterpart.

Featuring several heroes (get it?) from past games, players must direct their troups in turn-based combat. Despite being steeped in series??in-jokes and references, it?ôs still accessible to the outsider ??more accessible than several of the actual games in the series, I?ôd say.
Just to prove I?ôm not all fun and games, here?ôs one of the most useful apps launched this year: Newton Calendar, a companion to the popular Newton Mail app.
Credit: CloudMagic
The interface is simple, and easy-to-use, with the most useful feature being Schedule View. Users can sync their calendars with their Google and EWS calendars, and, while iCloud support is not currently part of the app, it?ôs rumored to be coming soon.

280,apps,"2017 saw a nice bunch of useful and inventive apps hit the Play store, and a number of our older favorites got some notable updates too.
We?ôve rounded up 30 of our favorites from our testing through the year ??scroll through our list, find your must-haves and be sure to let us know which ones you?ôre rocking on your own device into the new year.

Practically all Android phones come with a file explorer, but if you?ôre not happy with your current choice, Files Go is worth a look. In addition to helping you browser your phone?ôs storage, it also lets you send and receive files offline via Bluetooth, and displays handy cards to help you find large files, unused apps and other stuff that?ôs simply taking up space on your device.
??Files Go

If you live in India and need to transfer money or make a payment, Google?ôs Tez is one of the most ingenious ways to do it. Once you connect it to your bank account with your linked UPI address, you can send and receive cash instantly ??and if you?ôre in proximity of the person you?ôre making a transaction with, you don?ôt even to exchange personal details.
??Tez

If you?ôre getting to grips with English, or looking to improve your grammar when writing emails, reports, and messages, Grammarly Keyboard can help. It suggests improvements to your input as you type and make automatic corrections as well, so your text reads better ??while also giving you a chance to learn from your mistakes on-the-fly. My only gripe is that it doesn?ôt allow for gesture-style typing, a la Swype and SwiftKey, but it?ôs still plenty useful for folks who want to fix their grammar.
??Grammarly Keyboard

Truecaller?ôs caller ID works great because of its growing community of users who tag numbers and report spammers ??but it?ôs now even better because it added two handy features. The first lets you send and receive money from your contacts via UPI in India; the second lets you scan numbers printed on paper or billboards, or even scribbled on a napkin, to call and save for later. It?ôs now become one of the first apps I install when setting up a new phone.
??Truecaller

Sick of people peeping at your phone while you?ôre out in public? BlackBerry?ôs Privacy Shade lets you black out your screen, save for a rectangular or circular area that you can resize and move around. While it?ôs activated, you can use your phone as normal to navigate to apps and individual messages. You can turn it on or off from a persistent notification or by tapping a dedicated Quick Settings tile. Oh, and it?ôs great for reading in bed without disturbing your partner with a bright screen.
??BlackBerry Privacy Shade

Datally is designed to give you control over apps to prevent them from chewing through your data plan ??both during active use and while running in the background. Once you?ôve spotted data-hungry apps, you can choose to restrict their consumption, or make a note to ditch them for more efficient alternatives.
Additionally, the app also comes with a public Wi-Fi finder that will guide you to locations where you can hop online for free. How handy is that?
??Datally

Tired of having to stretch your fingers to reach across your phone screen? Some brands come with a built-in one-handed mode to shrink your display?ôs contents down to a more manageable size, but if that doesn?ôt sound like your handset, you?ôll need this app from the folks at XDA.
It doesn?ôt require rooting, and be toggled using a Quick Settings tile, a launcher shortcut or a floating button. Not bad for the low price of free.
??One-handed mode

Microsoft?ôs developed an excellent tool to help people with visual impairments get around indoor spaces, and it?ôs called Path Guide. When you?ôre in a building that?ôs been previously mapped out by a human user, it?ôll help you navigate the space by telling you how many steps and in which directions you?ôll need to turn in order to find, say, the restroom in a large mall.
It?ôs free to use, and works for both navigation and for recording paths. If you?ôre in popular public buildings a lot, you could do your bit to help others by recording navigation guides for them.
??Path Guide

Trips was already great for automatically collating your travel tickets and bookings into one place and recommending places to visit, but it?ôs now even more powerful, thanks to a couple of nice updates from earlier this year.
It now captures bus and train tickets as well and adds them to your itinerary. And in case you make a last-minute booking offline, you can now tap the + button and enter those details manually to keep your schedule up-to-date. Trips also now lets you share the reservations for your journey, including hotel booking and travel tickets, straight from the app via email.
It also plays nice with custom lists that you?ôve created in Google Maps or Search, and there?ôs an option to merge multiple trips into a single adventure.
If you?ôre heading out of town for the holidays, this is a must-have on your phone.

This is Facebook basically Messenger without a bunch of (mostly) unnecessary bells and whistles. For folks who are low on storage space and RAM, it?ôs a great choice.
You?ôll lose out on voice and video calling, and the ability to send GIFs (boo), as well as some useless bloat like Messenger Day (aka Stories), bots and games (yay).
That seems like a small price to pay for massive savings on space: Lite takes up just 17MB, less than a tenth of what Messenger requires on your phone. You should also find more than 100MB of RAM freed up when you make the switch. In the event that it?ôs not available on Google Play in your country, you can grab it from APKMirror.
??Messenger Lite

Wish you could hire a bot to handle your WhatsApp messages when you?ôre busy? Can?ôt Talk?ôs got you covered. Just set up a custom message, and toggle auto-reply on: when someone pings you on WhatsApp, it?ôll automatically send out your text and let you know the task?ôs been taken care of with a silent notification. It only worked with WhatsApp in our testing, but support for other services is likely on the cards.
??Can?ôt Talk (Beta)

Instagram?ôs image-and-video sharing app has been around for ages now, but it got oh, so much better in 2017 with a bevy of new features. Its Stories feature works really well for browsing and sharing ephemeral posts, and you can now add images to Stories that are older than 24 hours, as well as save select Stories to be displayed on your profile well after they?ôve expired.
You can also join in on a friend?ôs livestream instantly, and liven things up with filters and masks in live video. My favorite feature is the ability to save posts into Collections that you can label yourself ??it?ôs how I did most of my gift shopping this year from lesser-known brands. Plus, you can now follow hashtags in addition to following others??profiles. And if you?ôre looking to clean up your profile, you can now archive posts so they?ôre hidden from view until you search for them. No wonder it?ôs become my messaging app of choice this year.
??Instagram

Bonfire is Facebook?ôs take on instant group video chats that?ôs aimed at millennials. It?ôs great for people invested deeply in the social network?ôs ecosystem, as it makes it easy to invite your Facebook contacts, and share screenshots of your conversations straight to Instagram. You?ôll also find stickers and the option to resize windows as you like, a nice upgrade from Messenger?ôs built-in video chat feature. However, it may not be available for you on Google Play, depending on your location; if that?ôs the case, find it over on APKMirror.
??Facebook Bonfire

There are loads of apps for voice and video calling nowadays, but if most of your contacts are still on Skype, Microsoft?ôs Lite version of the service is worth a try.
It weighs in at just 13MB, while bundling essential functionality as well as a few additional features, including an SMS inbox and a mobile data usage monitor. That should help you save some storage space on your phone, as well as offer a smoother experience on older devices.
??Skype Lite

Whether you love or loathe Facebook, it?ôs hard to deny that it?ôs one of the best tools for tracking events around you. The social network?ôs new Local app, a rebranded version of Events, lets you search through happenings across the US, sorted into categories like ?òMusic,???òNightlife,???òArts & Culture,??and ?òFood & Drink.??
You can also look up events by date, as well as see what?ôs going on around you on a map. The revamped interface is neat and clean, and makes light work of finding something fun to do in town.
Sadly, it?ôs only available in the US for now, but hopefully it?ôll roll out to more folks across the globe next year.

A bomb?ôs gone off in Inverness station, plunging the world into peril. A stranger hands you a package that could save the planet, but you?ôll need to get moving to rescue everyone.
That?ôs the plot of this ingenious fitness app-game combo. As you cover more ground through the day, The Walk will reveal more of its story to you. You?ôll also find additional challenges and pick-ups throughout the app. What better way to hit your daily 10,000 step goal? Try the free version, or pony up for the paid one if you enjoy it.
??The Walk: Fitness Tracker Game (Free)

Clue?ôs beautiful period tracking app has been around for a while, but I only learned of it recently when our own Rachel Kaser recommended it for this roundup.
In addition to a fantastic interface that?ôs informative and easy to scan, it helps you track your fertility accurately, and share your menstrual cycle data securely with people you trust. This year, the app also updated its pill tracking functionality with handy reminder notifications and a new design to show which days you?ôre at greater risk of getting pregnant if you?ôve missed a pill.
??Clue

BBC?ôs revamped recipe book brings more than 10,000 recipes spanning a wide range of cuisines, courses, and techniques, in a new easy-to-read interface ??making it a one-stop shop for all your cooking reference needs. Once you?ôve signed in, you can search through and view the lot of them, complete with nutrition information, beautiful photos, step-by-step instructions, and complementary dishes for each recipe. Oh, and it?ôs completely free.
??BBC Good Food

Google?ôs launched a bunch of optimized apps for low-end devices this year, and regardless of what phone you?ôre rocking, they?ôre great for saving on storage space.
YouTube Go lets you watch videos from across the platform, while also offering options to save clips to enjoy later. You can also use it to beam videos to a friend?ôs phone, even when you?ôre both offline.
It?ôs worth noting that this is aimed at users who want to save on mobile data, so you won?ôt be able to stream video at 720p or higher quality. Whether you?ôre on an expensive plan or are traveling and can?ôt afford much data abroad, this is handy to stave off boredom with.
The app recently left beta, but it?ôs still only available in select countries. If it?ôs not available to you from Google Play, you can grab it from APKMirror.
??YouTube Go

Player FM?ôs podcast player has been around for a while now, but it recently got a bunch of great new features with the launch of version 4 in November, as it inches closer towards offering a premium experience with a paid subscription.
The free app is now easier to navigate thanks to a new bottom navigation bar; you can also sync your account between multiple devices, as well as a web app.
There?ôs also an option to create custom playlists with individual download options, so you can set one up to work offline on your morning jog. If you?ôre low on storage space, you can have the app compress podcast audio files by as much as 70 percent.
For folks who enjoy longer episodes like I do (one of my favorite shows, Dan Carlin?ôs Hardcore History, offers up episodes that are three to four hours long), you?ôll appreciate the new bookmarks feature. You can annotate them and have them sync across your devices too. If you haven?ôt yet settled on a podcast app, this is certainly worth checking out.
??Player FM

On the road with your family this holiday season? Kill time on your lengthy travels with Dark Stories, a game that?ôs a lot like 20 Questions ??only, instead of having players guess what animal, place, or object you?ôre thinking of, they have to deduce the sinister circumstances that lead up to the situation you describe in a short sentence or two. It?ôs engaging for the whole family, as it encourages lateral thinking and includes puzzles of varying levels of difficulty.
??Dark Stories


I know most people have Gmail, but if you?ôre not already using the Smart Reply feature, you?ôre missing out. I previously only used Gmail on my phone when I absolutely had no other choice ??but it?ôs now my weapon of choice for tackling email better than I ever have in the past. The new Smart Reply feature (which builds on the same functionality from Google?ôs Inbox app) lets you respond to messages with just a tap, filling in concise, contextual and meaningful replies. It?ôs how I now reply to 5x more email than before.
??Gmail

I looked at a bunch of to-do apps this year, and while Microsoft?ôs To-Do is new for 2017, it doesn?ôt do very much. Google Keep remains my primary weapon of choice, but I?ôm impressed by all the new features Any.do has added.
In addition to allowing for multiple shareable lists, reminders, and plenty of customization options, Any.do now has a Slack bot, Alexa integration, the ability to add items to your calendar, and a bunch of beautiful new home screen widgets that are flexible and functional.
You can pay to unlock additional features like file attachments and location-based reminders, but the free tier should cover most folks??needs.
??Any.do

Whether you?ôre looking for a distraction-free writing tool, or need a place to brainstorm out loud, Paper?ôs got you covered. Dropbox has been tweaking its freestyle document creation app for a while now, and I find it immensely useful for writing longform pieces. It?ôs also great for collaborating with others on articles, whitepapers, or even just ideas. And of course, all your files are stored and synced across devices in your Dropbox cloud storage account for easy retrieval.
??Dropbox Paper

Duolingo has been around for years, helping people learn the basics of nearly 30 languages (including Klingon and more recently, High Valyrian) with fun gamified courses. This year, it?ôs been working hard to support a number of Asian languages, and it?ôs already added Mandarin and Japanese to the list. For folks who want to learn to speak the most popular language in China, the app includes business and internet lingo. Oh, and Hindi is in the works, too.
??Duolingo


Google?ôs tool for creating smooth cinemagraph-style looping GIFs with your camera is now available on Android, and it works like a charm. The app defaults to shooting three second loops, which are stabilized to almost gimbal-like smoothness. If you want to shoot something longer, you can combine multiple clips together. You can also export your results as a video if you want a higher quality option.
Then there?ôs another mode called ?úFast Forward,??which is basically Google?ôs take on a hyperlapse. If you?ôre looking to try new things with your camera, this is a great place to start.
??Google Motion Stills

There are now a bunch of different apps for applying art-style filters to your photos, but I?ôm yet to see that offers effects as tasteful as Porta?ôs. They work especially well on landscapes and urban scenes, but they look pretty neat on portraits as well. You?ôll want to fiddle with the sliders a bit to get just the right filter strength to suit your pictures, but it?ôs easy to get the hang of, and generate some high-quality results.

Linux CLI Launcher is an unusual app launcher that turns your regular Android phone into a full-fledged command line interface.
The quirky app essentially replaces the standard icon-based interface with command lines, which means that ??much like in the Linux terminal ??you will actually have to type out full commands to start apps and maneuver through your device.
Besides full support for native Android and Linux commands, the app also features a handy ?òaliases??functionality that lets you create your own shortcuts to effortlessly open apps. It additionally comes with built-in ?òsuggestions??to help you compose commands in the proper format. And kinda like Linux, it?ôs free.

Mobile notifications can be annoying, but sometimes, they make light work of triaging your email, messaging services, and other apps. In case you?ôre in the habit of clearing them before you?ôve had a chance to see what they?ôre about, Notification History Log is for you.
This clever little app lets you retrieve past notifications and search through them to find an alert you?ôve been looking for. I like how it lets me clear clutter off my phone?ôs interface, while also giving me more control over which apps??notifications I actually look at.
??Notification History Log

This free app is a flexible replacement for your notification shade; it not only skins the bar and alerts, but also lets you expand them as you would with stock Android. You can also move around the toggles for functions like Wi-Fi and mobile data.
It?ôs a small, but essential fix for a problem that quickly gets out of hand: my inbox is overflowing with pitches and it?ôs awfully hard to stay on top of it. Digital clutter can be exhausting, even when you?ôre not dealing with it ??so helpful apps like this are a godsend.

To help combat the threat the Freedom of the Press Foundation, led by our favorite spy-turned-advocate, Edward Snowden, launched Haven, an app for cheap Android burners that turns them into full-fledged home security devices.
Haven uses your phone?ôs built-in hardware ??cameras, microphones, light sensors, and accelerometers ??to monitor the room in your absence. It?ôll capture photos and audio of anyone entering the room and send them to your primary device to alert you of the activity.
Haven even captures light disturbances ??like a flashlight in a dark room ??using the built-in technology that auto-adjusts screen brightness when lighting conditions change.
And while sending images and audio clips over the air to your mobile device might sound like bad OPSEC, Haven taps the secure messaging app Signal so that each byte of data is protected with end-to-end encryption.

Leveraging the X?ôs TrueDepth sensors, development studio Hatchlings has crafted an amusing game that turns your face into a controller. That?ôs right, instead of using your fingers, NoseZone requires you to play with your face and hit targets by pointing your nose at them.
Here is how this looks:

The rules of NoseZone are pretty simple. The game creates numerous target boxes that you then have to hit by pointing your nose at them. The more targets you manage to destroy by moving your face, the more difficult it gets.
While it might seem like an overkill, the game is pretty fun to play once you get used to it.
Hatchlings founder and CEO Brad Dwyer believes the new interactive capabilities engendered by the iPhone X?ôs depth sensors will open up a whole new field of possibilities for both game developers and players.
?úThe future will be touchless and games are just the beginning,??Dwyer told TNW over email. ?úImagine a paralyzed person navigating and controlling an app UI with this same face-based input method. The possibilities are limitless.??

As with similar tools, you can create playlists and queues, and view and edit ID3 tags. Plus, it supports a range of formats, including, MP3, MP4, AAC, and OGG, and lossless ones like WAV, and FLAC.

The company also plans to launch a dedicated hardware music server next spring, so you can stash all your music there and free up space in your computer?ôs hard drive. $300 will net you a paperback-sized device with 2TB of storage; you can pre-order it now to save $50.
That makes Voltra a lot more powerful than other standalone music player apps, like Dopamine ??but it?ôll now have to compete with Plex, which offers free media server software and just launched a dedicated music player for desktops.
Should you give Voltra a go? If you?ôre not already fully invested in streaming services and still have tracks stored on your computer, you?ôll be hard-pressed a nicer looking app to play them with. Grab the installer here to try it.

The update, spotted by Polygon, includes a change to the payment section of the guidelines, which now state:
Apps offering ?úloot boxes??or other mechanisms that provide randomized virtual items for purchase must disclose the odds of receiving each type of item to customers prior to purchase.
In practice, this should function the same as Blizzard?ôs new rules of disclosure for Chinese Overwatch players. The company recently listed the odds of getting each kind of item in a loot box on its Chinese website, after Chinese gaming regulations forced the transparency.
It doesn?ôt actually say in the rules where the disclosure must be. I checked the app page for Hearthstone (the first game with ?úloot boxes??on iOS to come to mind) and couldn?ôt find anything explicitly stating the odds.
This change doesn?ôt really effect the way loot boxes themselves function, but it might skirt some kind of gambling regulation if the company tells you ahead of time how likely you are to get the prize you want.

287,apps,"It seems San Francisco-based Uber continues to struggle with legislation on the other side of the pond. The European Union top court has downplayed the car-handling company?ôs claims of being a technology and not a taxi company, ruling that its operation should be regulated as a regular transport service, Bloomberg reports.
The reasoning behind the ruling is that, since they use their own cars, Uber drivers fall under the category of transport service providers. The worst part for the company is that the decision is final, with no opportunity to appeal.
?úThe service provided by Uber connecting individuals with non-professional drivers is covered by services in the field of transport,??the EU Court of Justice ruled on Wednesday. As such, European states have every right to ?úregulate the conditions for providing that service.??
Contrary to this judgement, Uber argued it offers a technology platform connecting passengers with independent drivers ??not merely a transportation service.
While the ruling concerns UberPop ??an affordable service that allowed unlicensed drivers to pick up passengers ??it could have larger implications for the future of the gig economy in Europe.
?úThe decision by the European Court of Justice is a set-back for Uber not just in Europe, but all over the world,??Jovana Karanovic, founder of Reshaping Work and gig economy PhD candidate at the Amsterdam Vrije Universiteit, told TNW. ?úIt sends out a signal that Uber is indeed a transportation company, and not a technology company, as they call themselves.??
?úWhen it comes to consequences for the entire gig economy, the ruling essentially sends out a signal that European Union is stepping in to regulate market competition,??she continued. ?úWhile the majority of the gig economy is still in the ?úgray zone,??single-market regulations could make it difficult for companies in the gig economy to take advantage of those European states that were slow to regulate this growing economy.??
Meanwhile, UberX ??which requires drivers to get a license ??will remain unaffected by this ruling.
This marks yet another big hit to the company in Europe, after Uber lost its license to operate in London earlier in September. Of course, the biggest losers in this situation were the drivers, not the car-sharing service.

The idea was that Windows would remember what apps you were using at any given moment so that you can easily resume a workflow or collection of apps. As Microsoft put it, the feature would let you ?újump back in time to find what you were working on.??
Seven months later, the feature is finally available to try. It comes as part of Build 10763, which was released today to the Insider Fast ring for testers who aren?ôt afraid of running into bugs.
You access the Timeline the same as Task View (such as Win+Tab). By default timeline shows various snapshots of the apps you were using at a particular time, including an annotated scrollbar to help you find your way. You can also tap on a ?òSee all??button to check out everything you were working on in a given day ??or you can just use the search bar.

The feature even connects to your mobile devices if you?ôre using one of Microsoft?ôs apps like Cortana or the new Edge mobile browser. But if you?ôd like some more privacy, you can turn off Microsoft?ôs activity collection in settings.
This build includes a ton of other updates, including a sleeker dark theme for Edge, an improved Cortana Notebook, a split touch keyboard, and greater use of Microsoft?ôs new Fluent design principles throughout the OS.
Most notably, Sets, a feature that will add browser-like tabs to any app, is being released in a limited trial with this build. Unfortunately, that means not all Insiders will be able to test them right now, even if they?ôre running the newest build.

Hard Questions: Face Recognition
Posted by Facebook on Wednesday, December 13, 2017
Previously, you could disable auto-tagging suggestions by going into the ?òTimeline and Tagging??section of Settings, but it?ôs phrased rather unclearly: ?úWho sees tag suggestions when photos that look like you are uploaded???
Most people probably wouldn?ôt be able to immediately tell that was the setting they were looking for.
The new setting simply reads ?úDo you want Facebook to be able to recognize you in photos and videos,??with a yes/no toggle. Much clearer.

If you don?ôt mind Facebook?ôs face recognition, the company will now alert you when a photo of you is uploaded onto its platform, as well as use this technology to help visually impaired users identify their friends without the need for tagging. This only applies if you?ôre part of the audience for that post, so you won?ôt be notified if you happen to make a drunken appearance on the local news or something.
The exception to the audience rule is profile photos. The company will notify you if someone is using your face in a profile photo without your permission, to deter impersonators. It?ôs worth noting these features don?ôt apply in Canada and the EU, as Facebook doesn?ôt use facial recognition in those locations.

Google  had announced its intention to do so back June, but this is the first time it?ôs provided a concrete date.
Those quality standards are set by the Coalition for Better Ads ??which Google is a part of ??and they prohibit all sort of annoying ads. On desktop, those include pop-up ads, auto-playing videos with sounds, prestitials with countdowns, large sticky ads, and more. On mobile, these also include infuriating scrollover ads, flashing ads, etc. You can read more about best ad practices here and here.
Basically, the point is to prevents ads that you can?ôt choose to ignore, and I?ôm all for it. The company is taking a fairly strong-arm approach to it too. If just one ad causes the site to receive a ?òfailing??status for more than 30 days, Google will remove all ads from that site.

Inspired in spirit by Winamp and built on Electron using the open-source Music Player Daemon, Plexamp features a modern interface and pulls in music that?ôs indexed in your Plex server (which could be the lone laptop you use, a refurbished spare desktop, or a NAS-equipped server configured for the task).

You can use Plexamp offline, or remote control other Plex players when you?ôre connected to your network. Additionally, it supports a range of music formats, including lossless ones like FLAC. The interface features a fairly small player with four different sizes, including one that hides the app entirely.
Instead of letting you browse your extensive music collection, Plexamp is built around a ?òdiscovery??framework ??it?ôll show you recently added and played albums, and playlists you?ôve updated. You can search through your catalog, but don?ôt expect to see a grid of every album you?ôve indexed in Plex.
That makes it a little less than ideal for people who want to casually scan through all their music like I do ??but it does make for a more streamlined experience if you know what you?ôre looking for. There are also a few nice touches like gapless playback, automatic soft transitions between songs, and a UI that adapts to the colors present in the album art of whatever you?ôre listening to.
The sparse interface design will likely appeal to minimalists: buttons appear when they?ôre contextually relevant, and disappear when you switch between screens: when you hit ?òplay??on a chosen track, you can hover over Plexamp to see playback controls and buttons to switch between a visualizer from the good ol??days, and a lyrics view. The rest of the app?ôs menu is accessible from the system tray.

In my brief testing, I found Plexamp to be a lot less flexible than Winamp when it came to doing things like browsing music and curating playlists. It also seemed a bit finicky with certain files, and some visualizations didn?ôt load for me. But that?ôs just me ??if you?ôre looking for a better way to play tracks stashed on your hard drive, this is a good way to go. And of course, it doesn?ôt hurt that it comes with a price tag of free.
Give Plexamp a try by downloading it from here; you?ôll need to first install Plex, sign up for an account, and have it index your music before you can play tracks through Plexamp (don?ôt worry, it?ôs easy enough, should only take a couple of minutes, and the free tier includes most of the features you?ôll need to get started).

295,apps,"Silicon Valley investors are shutting the door on popular trivia app, HQ.
Riding a wave of success in 2017, the app?ôs founders, Rus Yusupov and Colin Kroll are attempting to raise a new funding round, hoping to land a valuation as high as $100 million. According to a report from Recode, however, things aren?ôt going exactly as planned.
While venture capitalists are always on the lookout for the next big thing, and HQ certainly fits the bill in this regard, many are declining to participate. Some are concerned with the app?ôs longevity, while others are more than a little worried about the app?ôs founders. At least three prominent investors have declined to participate so far due to troubling conduct on behalf of the founders found during due diligence.
Colin Kroll, for example, comes with a lot of questions after being fired from Twitter shortly after the company acquired his last startup, Vine. According to three people with direct knowledge of the situation, Kroll was fired for being a bad manager, and for his ?úcreepy??behavior toward women, behavior that made numerous former colleagues uncomfortable.
He was also difficult to work with, according to conversations Recode had with more than 15 colleagues at Twitter and Vine. They described him as ?úabrasive and disinterested??and noted he could be verbally abusive to colleagues. He was also known to show up late to work, hungover, and disheveled.
And then there?ôs Yusupov. Yusupov ??one of Vine?ôs other co-founders ??was also fired from Twitter. But perhaps his most egregious offense was his treatment of a reporter, Taylor Lorenz. Intending to write a light-hearted piece for The Daily Beast, Lorenz reached out to the app?ôs star host, Scott Rogowsky.
Then this happened, according to Lorenz:
The Daily Beast simultaneously reached out to the HQ public relations email account and Yusupov, one of HQ?ôs founders, letting him know of our plans to write a story about the show?ôs host.
Several hours later, we received an email from Yusupov stating that HQ was ?únot making Scott available to discuss his involvement with HQ with the media/press.??The reporter informed Yusupov that we had already interviewed Scott and that the story was nearing publication, but encouraged him to call us with any concerns.
That?ôs when things went off the rails.
Yusupov, the CEO of HQ, called the reporter?ôs cellphone and immediately raised his voice. He said that we were ?úcompletely unauthorized??to write about Scott or HQ without his approval and that if we wrote any type of piece about Scott, he would lose his job.
The article continues to discuss abusive behavior by the Yusupov, and the fluff piece was ultimately reframed to focus on HQ?ôs co-founder, rather than its host. Ysupov, for his part, later apologized for his behavior.
HQ?ôs future is an uncertain one. Investors are hoping the app can transition from a twice daily trivia show to a legitimate business that outlasts its viral appeal. That?ôs a challenge. Placing bets on two founders with known character issues, that?ôs something else entirely.

296,apps,"No parent today should need to be told their kids are at risk every time they go online, use a cellphone, or engage in internet activities. It may be difficult for some to imagine that their child could get involved in something dangerous, but it happens. Even to good kids.
To get some insight, we spoke with Dr. Matt Phillips, who is a brain surgeon, a father, and the creator of an AI-powered parenting app called Social Judo.
He told us he was worried about his kids ?úI?ôm a brain surgeon, you know,??he said with a chuckle, ?úI like to think I?ôm a pretty smart parent ??I?ôm a good parent.??He went on to say:
Being a physician, I don?ôt believe ?únot my kid,??or ?únot me.??I?ôve seen really good people get bad diseases. My kids are just as vulnerable as my neighbor?ôs or anyone?ôs. Really normal and nice kids have the same lapses in judgment as anyone else does.
But what?ôs a parent to do? There are several ?úquick and easy??answers:
Not to burst anyone?ôs bubble ??or tell anyone how to raise their own kids ??but all of those solutions are problematic.
Kids will get on the internet whether you give them a device or not. And even if you have full-access to the devices your children use, parents are never going to find everything ??especially if kids want to hide it.
Take it from the experts, Dr. Phillips says:
Most parents aren?ôt going to be able to keep up with the language these kids are using, or the apps they?ôre on. Not every parent has the time to go through all of this information.
Things can go unnoticed for long periods of time, even when parents are paying attention.
Michelle Carter used text messages to systematically convince her boyfriend to kill himself. Finally in 2014, after two and a half years, her efforts paid off when 18 year old Conrad Roy III committed suicide.
The explicit nature of the texts ??urging Roy over and over to kill himself ??are almost unbearable to read. We won?ôt share them here. CNN reports the prosecutor in the case, Katie Rayburn, said:
It got to the point that he was apologizing to her, ??apologizing to her for not being dead yet
There can be no greater loss or sorrow in a parent?ôs life than losing a child ??no matter the age. Finding out your teenage son or daughter, at 15 or 16, was leading a dangerous secretive double-life is beyond a nightmare. And there are no words to describe how it must feel when parents only discover the horrible truth once it?ôs too late to act.
Worst of all, Carter and Roy ??and many others like them ??aren?ôt monsters that you could point out in a crowd as the ?òbad kids,??or the ?òmost at risk??children. What transpired between them falls along the lines of a worst-case scenario, but few children are completely safe from harm.
The app stores for both iPhone and Android are littered with programs to help you hide images and texts. They overflow with apps designed to allow anyone to chat with anyone in the world privately.
But kids don?ôt even need a secret app: we?ôve reported on how seemingly innocuous apps, like Periscope, are used to exploit children.
It may be irresponsible for any parent ??whether they?ôre a brain surgeon or the lead developer for Google ??to assume they?ôre savvy enough to figure out what kids are doing with devices.
Kids can send hundreds of messages a day, access dozens of apps, and interact with even more people through the chat feature of games. Over the course of a single day?ôs use they might interact with hundreds or even thousands of people.
The sheer amount of data produced by a child using a cellphone could be overwhelming for a parent to search through every day.
What if you miss the one text message or Periscope comment where your child gives their address to a stranger?
Luckily, AI is really good at looking at data. Dr. Phillips??Social Judo program is like a Google Analytics for parents. It uses proprietary software in combination with IBM?ôs excellent Watson platform. This allows it to not only provide real-time insights, but also constantly update itself to look for new threats.
The app monitors for profanity, sexting, nudity, porn, radicalization, and other key indicators of danger. If it finds something questionable it alerts parents and they can go from there.
There are a lot of watchdog apps ??and many are free (Social Judo does require a subscription). Few of them, however, use AI to do the heavy-lifting.
Hopefully Social Judo, and other AI-powered solutions like it, will provide a safer world for children. As Dr. Phillips told us:
If there?ôs any chance it can prevent even a single child from being hurt, it?ôs all worth it

The launch was spotted by Boston-based app analytics firm, Apptopia. This makes it the second market it?ôs launched in, after Facebook started a soft beta of the app in Denmark.
Adam Blacker, PR at Apptopia, said ?úWhile Denmark is a top three country in terms of soft launches, Norway is chosen less often. It?ôs possible Facebook strategically chose a market physically near Denmark to create a bigger network of engagement and see how that plays out.??
According to Blacker, Bonfire has only had 4,000 downloads to date. It?ôs still very much a small-fry, especially compared to its larger rival Houseparty, which Apptopia says has gets downloaded two million times each month. That?ôs deliberate though; Facebook likely wants to test out the app on a small market before it decides to embark on a wider roll-out.
However, everything indicates that a global release is on the horizon. Not only is Facebook releasing Bonfire to a wider audience, but it recently launched the app on Android. The fact that Bonfire is released across both platforms suggests Facebook is pretty keen on the idea.

The two videos, starring comedian Romesh Ranganathan as a kind of Twitter mentor, explain some of the basics of Twitter in a flippant tone that seems less tutorial and more parody in parts.
In the first one, Romesh coaxes a timid potential user named Kenny G ??there?ôs a reference millennials are sure to get ??to join. There?ôs no explanation as to why Kenny has a number of horror puppets in his home, unless this is what Twitter thinks non-Twitter users do with their time.

The second is a little less patronizing, as Romesh follows another neophyte named Julio around on a segway and explains how the Explore tab works in the app.

My first thought is that this seems to come a bit late. Twitter has been a staple of social media for years now ??it?ôs a bit past the point to start telling people exactly how to use it.

That response, also reported by The Verge, reads as follows:
When Chamath was at Facebook we were focused on building new social media experiences and growing Facebook around the world. Facebook was a very different company back then and as we have grown we have realized how our responsibilities have grown too.
That sounds an awful lot like an admission that, when Palihapitiya was at Facebook, the goal was indeed to indoctrinate users with feedback loops. It?ôs certainly not disagreeing with him.
The rest of the statement is not much more encouraging:
We?ôve done a lot of work and research with outside experts and academics to understand the effects of our service on well-being, and we?ôre using it to inform our product development. We are also making significant investments more in people, technology, and processes, and ??as Mark Zuckerberg said on the last earnings call ??we are willing to reduce our profitability to make sure the right investments are made.
For what it?ôs worth, I believe Facebook when it says it?ôs not about cutthroat growth strategies anymore. Why should it be? Facebook won the battle for the human mind, for all meaningful intents. It?ôs got billions of users, controls three of the most important social media/messaging apps on the market, and is a household word that almost every human on earth has heard.
But the implication that it is more considerate of how it affects people because now ??now ??it can afford to be is kind of gross. The trick is doing the right thing before that point, Facebook. And doing so right after a soft admission of your own site?ôs destructive addictiveness isn?ôt a good look.

305,apps,"Norwegian outlet Dagens N√¶ringsliv reports that Tidal now only has enough money left to last another six months in the competitive streaming music business ??which is bad news for fans of high-fidelity audio.
The company, fronted by rapper Jay Z, is said to have run up about $44 million in losses in 2016. However, a spokesperson told Engadget that the business has been growing year on year, and the company has claimed that it will even become profitable next year.
If Tidal downs its shutters, it?ôll leave about 1.2 million subscribers out in the cold ??and sadly, their options for lossless audio are limited. Deezer launched a HiFi tier with 16-bit FLAC versions of most of its music catalog last month, at the same price as Tidal?ôs high-fidelity offering.
Meanwhile, Spotify hasn?ôt yet taken things forward with lossless content since it trialed the option in a limited test earlier this year. And neither Deezer nor Spotify are available in every part of the world just yet. It?ôs likely that there simply isn?ôt enough interest in lossless audio just now to sustain a business like Tidal ??especially when the war for streaming music subscribers is being fought tooth and nail by larger players including Apple, Google and Amazon.

The most useful cheer update is probably the holiday cards you can send to family and Friends. You can customize them with special photos and messages, and the designs are cute, if generic, holiday designs involving stars and doves. As we get closer to the end of the month, the site?ôs users will be able to use a number of holiday backgrounds in their updates.
Most of the other holiday effects involve the Camera. Facebook will be adding time-exclusive stickers and Live effects in celebration of Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa. For example, in Facebook Messenger?ôs video chat you can add Santa and Rudolph filters, along with colorful Christmas light frames.
For those who are going to be spending their holiday energy on the New Year celebration, Facebook is adding effects to its Live broadcasts exclusive to the Eve celebrations. You?ôll also get to see a montage of your friend?ôs holiday pictures starting on December 28th.
Overall, this seems like a pretty cheerful update, so Scrooges might want to avoid Facebook for the next couple of weeks. The last holiday item in Facebook?ôs calendar is a New Year retrospective on January 4 and 5.

307,apps,"Twitter today revealed plans to give users a better way to create threaded tweets. Thanks to a new button in the tweet composer, you can add new tweets to a thread before you publish them.
Threads are a popular way of expressing thoughts and telling stories too long for even the new 280 character limit to contain. Up to this point, when a user wanted to indicate that a tweet was part of a longer story and to expect a thread, they?ôd put something like ??1/?)??at the end of their tweet. Or they?ôd say outright the tweet was part of an incoming thread.
Now that?ôs no longer necessary, as they can just tweet the whole thing at once.

In order to create a tweet thread, you press the small + button at the bottom right of the tweet composer. Then you say what you want to say in a second tweet, hit the button again to add further thoughts, and so on and so on. In addition, Twitter is adding a ?úShow This Thread??option to allow users to view all the tweets in a thread from the beginning.
I?ôve been trying to write Shakespeare?ôs sonnets line by line, but my hands started to hurt before I exhausted Twitter. According to a Twitter spokesperson, the limit on the number of tweets you can add via the + button before you publish is 25. After your first tweetstorm goes, you can hit a button which says ?úAdd another Tweet,??then add another 25 to your original thread. In theory, you could continue this forever. That might change depending on how people use it.
The update is rolling out to iOS, Android, and Twitter.com in the coming weeks.

It?ôs a handy addition; following a hashtag could be a good way to regularly discover new users who post about content you care about. Conversely, it?ôs useful for when you want to see more of a certain topic, but don?ôt want to deal with everything else individual users post.

To access the feature, just search for or tap on a hashtag you?ôre interested in, and select ?úfollow????just like following an individual account. The company says it will only shows ?útop posts??from a hashtag too, so you don?ôt have to worry about your feed being overwhelmed.
As for privacy, Instagram says it follows the same rules as regular accounts; the hashtags you follow will only be visible to your followers if your account is set to private.  So no worries if you don?ôt want everyone to know you need a daily dose of #cutehudgehogs or something.

310,apps,"Apple took to its Developer portal to announce that it?ôs turned on pre-orders in the App Store, so app makers can promote their new apps before they launch.
The company explained:
Customers can see your product page and order your app before it?ôs released for download. Once your app is released, customers will be notified and it will automatically download to their device.
The idea is to make it easier for developers to drum up interest in their upcoming apps and reach potential users more effectively: if you?ôve got an app that?ôs nearly ready for launch, you can set up a pre-order page in the App Store and link to it in your marketing material ahead of the official roll-out.
This applies to all Apple platforms, which covers iOS, macOS, and tvOS; you?ôll need to specify a release date that?ôs between two and 90 days in the future. Users who sign up to be notified of your launch will receive an alert, and also see the app download to their device automatically within 24 hours of your app going live.
The feature is similar to Google Play?ôs Pre-Registration, which became available back in May 2015, and has since been used in the launches of apps big and small, including Ustwo Games??immensely popular Monument Valley 2.
Apple is also following Google?ôs lead by replicating the latter?ôs Early Access section, with a ?òPre-Orders??section for games in the App Store. Hopefully, this will make it easier for devs to score more users as they get started with their apps, and have more people discover them as well.

It?ôs still early days, so the app is super-sparse at the moment. Just load the video into the app, wait a few seconds, and Google will throw out a comic strip with stylized effects. And that?ôs about it. You can pull down to refresh the storyboard with a different set of panels or styles, but you can?ôt manually edit panels or the layout.
As it stands, the app is a bit too barebones for my liking, but it?ôs easy to see how with a bit more meat it could become a popular choice for the Instagram crowd. Even just letting you add more pages to the comic book would make it a lot more enticing. If Google let me pick the frames used in panels, rearrange the layout, and add captions or speech bubbles, it?ôd be a lot of fun.
Still, it?ôs worth giving a shot, although be warned it?ôs an Android exclusive. You can download the app here, or check out Google?ôs other two experimental apps here.

The franchise is still alive and well, with Street Fighter 5: Arcade Edition set to drop on January 16. But the publisher has another treat in store for fans in 2018: a collection of 12 popular old SF games originally released between 1987 and 1999, starting with the very first Street Fighter ??ported to modern consoles and PC to celebrate three decades of delighting fighting game buffs.

Facebook removes any video uploaded that contains copyrighted music ??similarly to how YouTube works. So instead of adding an Ariana Grande song to that highlight reel of vacation photos and potentially getting a black mark for it, the company is giving you a selection of music it owns to use instead. Note that these will only be free and clear to use in Facebook and Instagram videos.
The sound collection contains a number of tracks, sorted by genre. A lot of it feels more kind of generic, like elevator music, but some of it is actually not that bad. With 1,000 tracks and 1,500 sound effects, it?ôs by no means an extensive list ??I?ôm not going to get to score my winter staycation with ?úStairway to Heaven,??sadly ??but it?ôs still good to have options.
YouTube also offers a collection of royalty-free songs and sound effects, so it?ôs obvious who Facebook is taking notes from. This might be part of Facebook?ôs effort to draw in new creators, away from the more well-established video site. Since the launch of its Watch app earlier this year, Facebook needs new voices and faces if it wants the kind of diverse content with which it can compete with the likes of YouTube.
While a free music library might not be the biggest step towards courting the YouTube audience, it is the kind of tool Facebook has long needed if it doesn?ôt want content creators to feel hamstrung as soon as they boot up the site.
Facebook?ôs Sound Collection is rolling out to everyone over the next few days. You can find the library here.

When Facebook announced Instant Games last year, it had 17 games in its repertoire, including Pac-Man, Galaga, and Space Invaders. Now it?ôs got over 70 games with several more to come next year, including the likes of Sonic, Angry Birds, and Disney Tsum Tsum.
The biggest update to Messenger is the addition of a livestreaming option. To stream yourself playing your Messenger game, you tap the camera icon in the corner of the screen. The broadcast will be saved to your Page or profile after it is complete. I don?ôt know how much of an audience there is for livestreams of Tetris, but I?ôve been surprised before.
Another update is the ability to game while video chatting. The feature will initially be tested with the game Words with Friends. Naturally, you?ôll still be able to use Facebook?ôs funny video filters, because what is social media for if not playing word games while you look like a cat?
The livestreaming started rolling out this week, while the video chat feature will be introduced early next year.

That?ôs handy, because it?ôs often easy enough to scan an entire email right from an alert. Gmail?ôs Android app presently only lets you archive or reply to messages from the notification panel ??neither of which may be useful to you for certain messages ??so this app intercepts those alerts and displays a custom notification with the ?òread??button on board. It works with multiple Gmail accounts, and you can add as many or as few of them as you like.

It?ôs worth noting that this feature isn?ôt free: you can try it as part of a seven-day trial at no cost, but after that, you?ôll need to pony up for either just this standalone functionality, or the whole raft of AutoNotification capabilities. In India, the Gmail feature cost me Rs. 75 ($1.16).
AutoNotification also does lets you create custom notifications with additional buttons in other apps, add more Quick Settings Tiles on Android 7.0 and above, reply automatically to chats in various messaging apps (though you can also try Can?ôt Talk), and integrates with Tasker to automate some of these functions.
While I?ôm glad to have found an app to tackle my emails better, it?ôd be nice to see Google take a hint and bake this right into the next version of Gmail?ôs Android app. Doesn?ôt look that hard, does it?

316,apps,"YouTube is gearing up to launch a paid streaming music service by March 2018, reports Bloomberg.
That could help the company take on the likes of Spotify and Apple Music ??but given that YouTube already has a Music app, as well as a paid subscription service (called YouTube Red), and Google already has a streaming service and music store, it?ôs an odd strategy to start on at this point.
Of course, the reason is most likely money. Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs predicted in its Music in the Air report that the streaming music market would grow to $28 billion per year by 2030, and Google will certainly want a large slice of that pie.
The one major advantage YouTube could have over its rivals is a huge catalog of video content to complement its music library. The service, which is internally referred to as Remix, is slated to feature video clips alongside tracks, and YouTube is said to be courting artists to help promote Remix when it?ôs closer to launch.
At any rate, YouTube will certainly have its work cut out for it, between creating a well thought out service and apps to contend with seasoned ones like Spotify, and securing licenses from major record labels and distributors to fill its catalog and make it available worldwide.
It?ôll also be interesting to see what this spells for Google Play Music, which has been around since 2011, but still feels like a work in progress in some respects. There was also some talk about merging YouTube Red with Google Play Music, but it seems like this new development might derail those plans.

There aren?ôt any major surprises, but it?ôs still nice to take a look back and see what iPhone and iPad users thought was worth the most of their precious time this year.
Here?ôs Apple best of everything from 2017.
Apps:
Games:
Songs:
Movies:
TV Shows:
Books (fiction):
Books (nonfiction):
Like I said, no real surprises. Social media being the most popular thing among iOS users feels like a borderline stereotype by now. It?ôs interesting to see that Snapchat and Bitmoji (which is frequently used with Snapchat) top the list despite Snapchat?ôs apparent inability to get a great deal of new users on board.
The fact that Super Mario Run takes the cake this year feels both deserved, and kind of tired. I?ôm curious to see what other popular franchise Nintendo could mine for next year?ôs killer app, considering Pokemon GO made off with crown last year. Metroid Mobile for 2018, anyone?

The top songs were dominated by Ed Sheeran, Bruno Mars, and Kendrick Lamar ??though the unbearably catchy Despacito was of course on there. I was surprised to see the country song ?úBody Like a Back Road,??since I?ôd never heard of it. Having pulled up the YouTube vid, I hope never to hear it again for the rest of my days (sorry, Sam Hunt fans).
It?ôs rather pleasant to see the top movies list dominated by movies starring female leads, if that?ôs not cliched to say. Wonder Woman was my personal favorite, but I?ôm also sucker for anything Disney and Star Wars.
As for shows, it feels odd to see Big Bang Theory alongside its ideological nerd show opposite, Rick and Morty. We also already knew no one was going to displace the fantasy juggernaut that is Game of Thrones. What in the name of the Lord of Light are we going to fill the gap with when that show wraps in a few years? Amazon better get cracking on that Lord of the Rings show.

 
As for books, I had to split the two lists up because apparently Apple doesn?ôt like to mix its peas with its porridge. It?ôs nice to see potboilers from stalwarts Dan Brown and John Grisham, and apparently everyone?ôs catching up on Margaret Atwood?ôs book now that the show adaptation is out there. The nonfiction is pretty standard fare, with my favorites being Neil de Grasse Tyson?ôs latest scientific text, and Mark Manson?ôs provocatively titled self-help tome.

Without further ado, here?ôs the list of top five most downloaded Apps, games, songs, movies, TV shows, and books on Google Play in 2017:
Apps:
Games:
Songs:
Movies:
TV shows:
Books:
Right off the bat, the list of most popular apps is full of drama and intrigue. And not just because TopBuzz Video made the list. FaceApp, which admittedly has some pretty cool functionality, had quite an interesting year thanks to a determination to be off-putting.

The real gem on this list is Boomerang, of course, because the 80s were awesome. If you weren?ôt around for them, then Yarn might be more your thing. Scary stories told in text message? That?ôs called dating.
We all knew Super Mario Run would be the biggest thing since the last big thing Nintendo brought to Android.. Honestly, Nintendo, it?ôs starting to feel unfair. Super Mario Run is a platformer based on other platformers that are based on an obscure game from the past called Super Mario Bros.

The top 5 most downloaded songs, like the rest of the entire planet, is mostly just Kendrick Lamar and Ed Sheeran.
It?ôs crazy that Doctor Strange is the fifth most downloaded movie, because it proves that babies randomly smashing buttons on their parents phones are a large portion of purchasers. If it were up to me, I?ôd just put Wonder Woman in the top five twice. Scratch that, all the movies in 2017 should be Wonder Woman.

On the small screen, Game of Thrones took the coveted number one spot ??good show, well deserved ??but Rick and Morty in second? Firstly, Archer ??this is what happens when it?ôs hard as hell to find somewhere to watch your latest season. You don?ôt get to win Google by avoiding streaming services. And second, bravo humanity. Rick and Morty is an excellent show that has to be watched a few times to appreciate ??like reading Herman Melville.
And now that JK Rowling is done ruling Earth, we actually have new books to read. In January, if you?ôd told me that Mark Manson?ôs book with an F-bomb in the title would be downloaded more than IT by Stephen King, I would have called you a fool. Well, who?ôs the fool now? Me. Well, played Mr. Manson. Video games, fantasy, and suicide round out the rest of the Potter-free books.

As Discord today revealed, the app has more than tripled its user base since this time last year, with 87 million registered users. With 1.5 million more joining every day, that number is likely to hit a round 90 million by the end of the year, double its users in May.
That would be impressive growth under the best of circumstances, but considering this year has been dotted with scandals aimed in Discord?ôs direction, it?ôs amazing as many people are joining as they are.
Discord has been dogged by allegations it harbored unsavory servers since the beginning of the year. In January 2017, Discord CEO Jason Citron told Buzzfeed News the company would step in if spotted anything illegal, but otherwise had no strong comment on the dozens of alleged white nationalist servers. ?úBecause we have such a large product, I think it?ôs inevitable that you have people who are misbehaving,??he said.
Then came August 2017. After the protests in Charlottesville, you couldn?ôt swing the figurative cat without hitting a story labeling Discord the ?úalt-right chat app.??The protests had apparently been organized within Discord chat rooms.
The scandal was apparently wrapped when Discord shuttered those specific chat rooms shortly after, though for the rest of the month that was the vast majority of the news anyone heard about the app.
Now the app is boasting 14 million daily active users, so clearly it can grow despite the criticism thrown onto its darkest corners. Hopefully it continues to be a relatively positive place as it becomes even more of a cornerstone of internet discourse.

The company explained its intention to do away with apps a year ago, and as we noted back in August when it officially announced its plans, only about 1 percent of Windows, macOS and Linux users actually used Apps, so they?ôve gotta go. However, Apps will still be available on Chrome OS-powered devices, like Chromebooks, and they?ôre accessible via direct links to their Chrome Web Store pages.

Each of the updates adds new appeal to Story content ??not only does it give your Stories added value, but it gives you an additional way to spruce up your profile.

Once you add a service and enter the details with which you signed up it, Tez will automatically pull in your previous bills, help you complete your payments, and even notify you of future bills when they come in.
That negates the need to manually track your own payments for various services, and also speeds up the process of completing transactions ??you no longer need to look up and enter the exact amount you owe for your latest cable bill. To make this happen, Google has partnered with more than 70 major service providers nationwide in the aforementioned categories.
Google?ôs beside itself with joy at having triumphed with Tez, its app for peer-to-peer payments in India. It noted that Tez has processed 140 million transactions since its launch in September, and that it accounted for 73 percent of UPI-based transactions in the country last month. That?ôs impressive, considering that it?ôs one of the newest apps to support India?ôs Unified Payments Interface, which is a system devised by the government to allow for inter-bank transactions.
It isn?ôt clear if there?ôs any money changing hands between Google and these service providers at the moment; plus, all UPI transactions are free of charge. So it appears that this is a push to get more people comfortable with Android and Google?ôs ecosystem of apps as it strives to help bring more people online with services optimized for those experiencing the mobile web for the first time.
The company noted that Tez?ôs bill payment features will arrive in a update in the coming weeks; next year, the plan is to add more functionality so it?ôs even more useful for independent merchants and small businesses (it already has 525,000 entrepreneurs using Tez for various kinds of transcations already). It?ôs likely that that?ôs when Google will begin monetizing its service.

327,apps,"At its third annual Google for India event in New Delhi today, the company launched a new search experience for mobile users, in the form of an app called Google Go.
Part of the new suite of optimized apps for the lightweight Android Go platform, it not only lets you search the web, but also see what?ôs trending around you, and offers shortcuts to things like the weather, popular images, GIFs, and YouTube videos.
The idea is to help folks who are coming online for the first time discover the lengths and breadths of the web. That means that the company has to go beyond simply offering a blank search box.

That?ôs why all those shortcuts take users straight to popular content of various kinds. In addition, Google Go begins displaying search results as you type, along with buttons containing suggestions based on your query. For example, if you start typing ?òjackets,??it?ôll surface buttons labeled ?òfor women??and ?òin Bangalore,??to help you refine your results without having to learn how to search like a seasoned pro.
There?ôs also a customizable row of shortcuts to your favorite services and apps for social networks, shopping, entertainment, news, banking, and more. It?ôs localized, so you?ôll see links to services that are popular in your country and area.
Google Go also supports a second language, so if you set one when you install it, you can switch your query and results to that language with just a tap. There?ôs also an option to only browse lightweight webpages when you visit search results, so as to save on mobile data.
We first saw the app in testing back in August, when it was labeled ?òexperimental??and featured a spartan interface. Having tried it then and again today, it seems like a smart approach to building a launchpad for people who are just getting the hang of browsing the web, and experiencing it first on a mobile device rather than a desktop.
Google Go is presently available to users in India from Google Play; give it a go by grabbing it from this page.

The new feature appears to be rolling out initially in India, and I got a chance to check it out here. You can access it by searching for a destination, and then tapping the motorcycle icon in the row of transport mode options.

The routes are generally faster (if not shorter), as they take into account shortcuts that are more easily accessible by two-wheeler, or offer directions that are quicker to navigate than when in you?ôre in a larger vehicle. Trips within town around 11AM were shorter by several minutes, while those that led you out of the city took significantly less time (Maps estimated that a 256KM trip would be roughly 40 minutes shorter on a bike than in a car).
You?ôll need the latest version of Google Maps on Android ??v.9.67.1 to be precise ??to try two-wheeler mode. Hopefully, it?ôll roll out to other countries that face traffic congestion and support large numbers of motorbikes. Google is slated to announce a few updates to its ?òGoogle for India??initiative today, so we?ôll soon learn if this feature is designed only for the country.

The fix, which is readily available to download here, comes as part of its latest beta for Mac (version 3.0.0). For context, the drag-and-drop appears to be limited to Macs only, so Windows users can wait for the final release.
Hello, we?ôd like to take care of your holiday wishlist item. This bug is finally fixed in the 3.0 beta that is available here: https://t.co/bYSl3bJ2hl

For those fortunate enough not to encounter this bug, let me sum it up for you. Every once in a while, when using the drag-and-drop feature to upload images, Slack would crash as soon as you hover an image over its client.
The annoying part is that sometimes the bug would get triggered by simply dragging an image over the app ??regardless if you meant to drop it in Slack or another app.

Having spent a couple of days testing out the beta, I?ôm happy to report back that using the drag-and-drop image upload feature hasn?ôt caused Slack to crash a single time yet ??and I did a fair amount of image uploading during this trial period.
Even better, the beta appears to be running smoothly altogether. So chances are you won?ôt have to deal with bugs until the official version lands.
Slack has yet to set a date in stone for dropping the final release, but it should be here soon enough. In the meantime, head to its site to download the beta version.

This AI-powered platform claims it can teach from beginner to fluency in just a few months ??through once-daily 20 minute lessons.
Learning a new language is hard. Some people seem to pick up new dialects with ease, but for the rest of us it?ôs a trudge through rote memorization. A never-ending stream of flashcards and nouns might not be the optimum learning experience for everyone.
Plus, it feels silly repeating animal names in a foreign language, knowing you probably won?ôt use them on your business trip.
How often is the word ?úostrich??gonna come up at the TNW conference in Amsterdam? Will I really need to know where the ?úbiblioteca??is in Mexico? 
According to Glossika CEO Michael Campbell, there?ôs a better way. He says Glossika?ôs proprietary machine learning algorithms mean there?ôs ?úno need for language experts to figure out what to teach in what order ??our AI figures out the complexity and sorting of any language automatically.??
The platform, which works in-browser on computer or mobile, features customizable lessons that take around 10 to 20 minutes. Users are advised to get a full night?ôs rest inbetween lessons ??there?ôs no powering through a week?ôs worth of material to ?òlevel up??or anything like that.
Campbell credits both the AI and a systemic approach to language learning for this success:
Fluency first, vocabulary second??fluency is the ability to manipulate all the parts of a sentence at will. You then use these sentences to add vocabulary and improve expression. You will continue to learn vocabulary for the rest of your life, but fluency can be delivered in a matter of weeks. 
Campbell?ôs methodology is based on using machines to find patterns that create a learning experience closer to the ideal of being totally immersed in a language, he told TNW:
Glossika gets you speaking in patterns right from the beginning. When familiar with Glossika, users find that acquiring any language is so much easier and intuitive. This is just like how immigrant children show up in a classroom and end up speaking the language in a few months.
The world is becoming smaller thanks to technology at-large. And while innovative gadgets that translate for you in real time are great, there?ôs nothing quite like being able to carry on a conversation in a different language with confidence.
I checked out Glossika?ôs free trial, and I can confirm that its Dutch lessons didn?ôt involve me saying ?úostrich??(struisvogel, if you?ôre curious) over and over.

333,apps,"Update: Since publishing this post, I?ôve learned that Windows 10 already has this. Perhaps it just doesn?ôt work as well without WizMouse, which is why I may not have noticed it while trying it out.
As someone who works at a computer all day, I?ôm always on the lookout for apps and tweaks that can improve my desktop experience. When I switched from the laptop I?ôve been using for nearly three years to an all-in-one that I?ôm reviewing this week, I noticed just how badly I missed a free 550KB tool that?ôs saved me hundreds of thousands of clicks over time (no, really, I did the math).
WizMouse detects when your cursor is on top of a scrollable window or section in an app, and lets you scroll through it without having to click first. For example, say you?ôre in your Gmail inbox; if you want to scroll through your Hangouts contacts in the left sidebar, you?ôll need to click in that area before you can wheel through them.
WizMouse saves you that click, and does so across apps and web pages. It may not sound like much, but once you try it, you simply can?ôt go back to clicking on areas before scrolling, like a neanderthal.
I find it especially useful when working in WordPress: there are so many fields to scroll through ??such as the article body, and the lists of categories and sections ??before I can publish a post, and it?ôs nice to not have to aim and click in those areas every time.
It?ôs also great for scrolling through content in multiple windows, as you don?ôt have to switch focus from one to another by clicking on it. So if you?ôre reading a web page while taking notes in a text editor, you can scroll through the page in your browser while the text editor stays on top ??no extra clicks necessary.
Windows already includes a handy ?òSnap To??option for mice, which places the pointer to the default button (like ?òOK?? every time a new dialog box pops up; WizMouse?ôs functionality would certainly complement that nicely.
You can get WizMouse at no charge from this page (it?ôs old, but it works just fine on Windows 10); there?ôs a portable installer if you need it, and also options to reverse the scrolling direction, as well as to bring the window you?ôre scrolling in to the foreground, and even to hide the system tray icon entirely. And if you?ôre interested in improving your computing experience, consider picking up a half-decent mouse too.

It?ôs essentially a repackaged version of the c9.io IDE, which Amazon acquired in 2016; it?ôs now more tightly integrated with AWS. The company says it?ôs designed for coding, running and debugging all in one place, as well as allowing for serverless development. The main interface is based on the Ace Editor, and is optimized for working on large files with minimal lag.
The editor also supports Vim mode, keyboard navigation commands, and the AWS CLI so you can bring up all your resources from the cloud service. Oh, and it also works with Sublime Text and TextMate themes.

Additionally, you can fire up new EC2 Linux server platform instances or connect remotely over SSH to an external machine easily. There?ôs also a panel in the editor to access lambda functions and import them into your local workspace for test and debugging serverless applications.
If you want to code with team members, you can simply invite them to a shared environment and work in tandem with multiple cursors and a chat window.

Cloud9 is free for AWS subscribers to use; you?ôll only be charged for things like computing power and storage with external machines. It?ôs in the US West (Oregon), US East (Ohio), US East (N.Virginia), EU (Ireland), and Asia Pacific (Singapore) regions.

YouTube?ôs approach is called ?òReels?? and the company outright admits it?ôs its own spin on the stories format in an announcement blog post.

Reels will be part of the Community tab, which already establishes a major difference from other apps??stories: it?ôs not available to everyone. On YouTube, stories are simply another way to help creators engage with their already expansive audience.

That makes it more of an interesting proposition, in my book.  My Instagram stories are populated with friends, brands, and celebrities. Few of those contain content I actually want to watch. But Reels are fundamentally difference different: these are people whose content you already willingly watch thanks to a subscription.

In fact, many YouTubers already have secondary channels for more casual day-to-day, but you then need to subscribe to a separate channel. With Reels, you can view all that content on one channel.
There are functional differences from stories, too. Though you?ôll still be able to shoot video, and add filters, texts, and stickers, Reels will remain for more than 24 hours.?ùThey also live on a separate tab on the creator?ôs channel, meaning they aren?ôt as in your face as stories are in other apps and you can completely ignore them if they?ôre not interesting.
YouTube says it?ôs experimenting with a beta version of Reels with a limited set of creators before expanding it to more people. The final product may end up looking different, but right now, I think YouTube is on to something.

For something that was presented to me as the ?únew Snapchat,??its alterations are surprisingly simple ones. If you?ôve stuck to using Snapchat?ôs basic social features up to now, rather than its original commercial content, you might not even notice much of a difference.
The primary change between the current version of Snapchat and its upcoming redesign is the separation of friend-based content and publisher content. Now, when you swipe left from the main camera screen, you?ôll have access to your friends??Stories, Bitmojis, and chats. The Discover content, which was previously tangled with the Stories, is now on a separate screen.
Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said in an statement published on Axios:
With the upcoming redesign of Snapchat, we are separating the social from the media, and taking an important step forward towards strengthening our relationships with our friends and our relationships with the media. This will provide a better way for publishers to distribute and monetize their Stories, and a more personal way for friends to communicate and find the content they want to watch.
Right now there?ôs no way to avoid seeing Snapchat?ôs branded content unless you just don?ôt look at Stories at all, due to them being in roughly the same place. So for users, this is a welcome separation of personal and professional content.

As a counterpoint to the arguments against his position, he called out edge providers ??Twitter in particular ??for being more of a danger to internet freedom. Trouble is, he doesn?ôt exactly have the right idea about what people fear from the obliteration of net neutrality.
In a speech given at the R Street Institute, Pai said ?úWhen it comes to an open internet, Twitter is part of the problem. The company has a viewpoint and uses that viewpoint to discriminate ??the real interests of these internet giants is in using the regulatory process to cement their dominance in the internet economy.??
Leaving aside that this doesn?ôt address his critics??concerns at all, Pai?ôs got the wrong end of the stick with regards to Twitter?ôs alleged discrimination. What he describes isn?ôt the kind of control net neutrality critics are crying out to stop.
One of the examples Pai cites in his concerns about Twitter?ôs refusal to promote a campaign tweet of Senator Marsha Blackburn. The video contained a rather provocative reference to Planned Parenthood, and was deemed to not fit the standards of Twitter?ôs advertising. As Twitter officials pointed out, the tweets themselves were never censored or removed, and no actions were taken against her account.
He also accuses Twitter of using its discretion to de-verify or suspend conservative accounts. Briefly acknowledging the concern that ISPs could restrict what sites we have access to, he says that Twitter and other sites like it are already controlling what we see online.
Here?ôs the difference between what he?ôs talking about and what pro-net neutrality protesters are talking about: Twitter refused to take money to actively promote something to all of its users. What we?ôre afraid of is ISPs taking money to passively allow sites to operate the same for all of us. And Twitter can only ?úrestrict??(de-verifying and failing to promote aren?ôt actually censorship) what we see on Twitter, while the potential power wielded by ISPs could restrict what we see anywhere online.
I?ôm not simply trying to defend Twitter, but equating an advertising dispute and revocation of a blue badge with net neutrality is a false equivalence. It doesn?ôt inspire confidence that the person with his hand on the controls has a firm understanding of what each button does.

345,apps,"Microsoft will soon be test-driving a feature in Windows 10 that could forever change how you use your PC. It?ôs also a feature you?ôve already been using for years.
Say hello to tabs. Or as Microsoft calls them, ?òSets.??
While Microsoft isn?ôt sure whether that name will stick, the idea is to bring browser-like tabs to not just Chrome and Edge, but virtually every Windows app. Moreover, it?ôs not just grouping duplicate instances of a single app; you can actually combine different apps into one window. Check out Microsoft?ôs explainer video:

Basically, Sets could help you keep apps group related apps for particular tasks, projects, or ideas, rather than just being a mess of windows that you?ôre constantly rearranging. If you?ôre researching a paper, for instance, you could theoretically combine a PDF reader, a PowerPoint presentation, and notes all into to one tabbed window.
Granted, you could already organize your apps by task or idea by using virtual desktops, but that method has some drawbacks. You can assign different desktops to tasks or projects, for example, but you can?ôt see or move them all at once. Sets would be giving users another layer of control to keep things nice and tidy.
Besides, tabs are likely more intuitive for the average user. After all, organizing resources into tabs is already how we browse the web and use plenty of Web apps. Heck, this is basically how Chrome OS operates. Microsoft is simply expanding that organizational concept to the desktop with full-fledged apps.
The idea was born out of the ?òTimeline??concept Microsoft introduced back during its Build conference in May. That feature allowed you to go back in time to see what apps you were using at any given moment, allowing you to easily resume a work setup or project. Sets are simply another way to group your apps.
At first, the feature will only be available on UWP (Universal Windows Platform) apps first because their sandboxed nature helps ensure you don?ôt break anything major. Over time, it seems the company hopes to expand to first part apps like Office and traditional Win32 apps as well.
In any case, it could be quite some time before the feature ever hits the public. Even users in Microsoft?ôs Insider testing program won?ôt all have access to it; the company will randomly select a small group of testers who will be able to access the feature to start. I hope I?ôm one of the lucky ones; as far as I?ôm concerned this is one of the most useful changes to Windows in years.

347,apps,"Snapchat is playing with object recognition filters, which will automatically recognize things in your images and create filters tailored to them. Needless to say, this looks like something advertisers could make the best use of.
The filters were first spotted by Mashable this week, and began rolling out to users shortly before that. So far, they contain some of the most enjoyable puns I?ôve seen in filters. For example, if you take a picture of your dog, you might get a filter that says ?úIt?ôs a Pawty!??The image recognition appears to be a little shaky, at present ??an image of a bunny gets a ?úNomz filter??in the Mashable article ??but it?ôs still a neat feature for those who use Snapchat filters regularly.
This might be a precursor to the larger Snapchat improvements that are likely in the works, and a way of setting the app apart in a time when it must attract new users. But this feature represents growth for the industry outside of Snapchat.
It?ôs likely to attract a lot of attention from advertisers, especially if they can be made to recognize individual products and businesses. Say taking a Snap of the Golden Arches got you a deal on Big Macs? Or taking a pic inside a clothing store showed you a filter of you wearing one of their new dresses? The applications seem expansive in that direction.
If nothing else, I expect to see a future where you can point your phone at your breakfast omelette and get a filter which says ?úThe start of an eggs-cellent day!??

Chrome Unboxed checked the Play Store for multiple models of Chromebook, and confirmed the Android app versions of the software appear to be available for all current Chromebooks. Among other models, Office apps appear to be on the Samsung Chromebook Pro, the Pixelbook, and two models of the Acer Chromebook 15.
Office apps have long been corralled to only a particular set of Chromebooks, with no apparent rules or reason behind it. Anyone who didn?ôt do careful research might purchase a Chromebook without knowing it couldn?ôt access their Word documents.
That?ôs no longer an issue. Considering that, at last count, over 1 billion people used Office, this will likely make the selection of a Chromebook easier and more consumer-friendly for some.
There?ôs a catch, though, because of course there is. According to ExtremeTech, anyone who owns a Chromebook larger than 10.1 inches will have to pay for an Office 365 subscription in order to edit documents. The Samsung Chromebook Pro, for example, has a 12.3-inch display, which puts it in the paid bracket. It?ôs the same catch that has always existed for Office users, as Microsoft classifies anything smaller than 10.1 as mobile, but it?ôs still worth mentioning in case Chromebook enthusiasts were hoping to use Word on their 2-in-1 for free.
We?ôve reached out to Microsoft for comment.

If that looks like a nightmare to you, you might want to check out AIO Launcher, an interesting new alternative that puts ALL the information and shortcuts you could ever need on a single scrollable screen.

The free app, developed by Evgeny Zobnin, features a simple text-heavy design with multiple sections containing everything from your last accessed apps and contacts, system information, texts, news, Twitter feed, calendar appointments, and even the current Bitcoin exchange rate in a customizable homescreen.
There aren?ôt any app icons: just tags for the ones you used last, and an alphabetical list of all your apps that you can drag out by swiping from the left edge of the screen. A search button at the bottom left lets you look up contacts, apps and the web in one place.
It?ôs certainly not for me, but it?ôs an interesting approach for those who don?ôt enjoy fiddling with icons to navigate their device?ôs interface, and who?ôd prefer to see as much information in a single screen as possible.
That said, AIO launcher still needs a lot of the work: I?ôd like to be able to decide what happens when I tap on a search result, customize the typography on the homescreen, add widgets from other apps, and so on. It?ôs also still a bit buggy: the search button once disappeared on me for a long while, and I can?ôt figure out how I got it to return later.

350,apps,"Adam Helps is an app that lets anyone living in the Toronto area hire others in their local communities to help them with odd jobs, much like TaskRabbit does (and to a lesser extent, classifieds services like Craigslist, Gumtree, and Kijiji).
If you?ôve burdened with some fiendishly tricky IKEA flat-packed furniture that needs assembling, or a lawn that needs mowing, you can put out the feelers into your local community and find someone available. You can even use it to find a babysitter, if you want to take the night off.
But there are a few key differences between Adam Helps and the competition. For starters, location plays a huge part in the service. Unlike digital cork-boards like Craigslist, Adam Helps is only accessible through a smartphone app, and it only shows jobs in your nearby vicinity (although you can change your location, which is why I was able to play around with it despite not actually being in Canada).
Another big difference is how people get paid. Individuals are free to charge whatever they want for jobs. This can either be a per-diem, an hourly rate, or a flat sum. Payment is done in-person, either as cash or check. This means that Adam Helps doesn?ôt take a commission, unlike other gig economy apps, like Uber and Lyft.
As company founder and CEO Adam McLeod explained: ?úWe made a conscious decision not to take commission from anyone working for someone else because our helpers have worked hard and earned their money.??Ultimately, the company plans to turn a profit from paid extras, with the service aiming to adopt a freemium model in the near future.
Trust plays a huge role into the service. As is the case with rival sharing economy service Airbnb, users of Adam Helps must verify themselves using their social media handles. There?ôs also a review element, and Adam Helps is immediately notified whenever a bad review is left, so it can intervene. Expanding on this further, McLeod said:
?úAll users must be verified by social media, and everyone can see the reviews left by previous users and helpers. With in-app messaging, we?ôre empowering users to decide what they need in order to feel safe and secure; as an example, if you?ôre looking for a babysitter, you may ask for references. Whereas if you?ôre having someone clear the snow from your driveway this might not be as important. The app has so much flexibility but it is regulated by the community. Since you?ôre likely to hire a neighbour we believe this already helps to establish some comfort and security between both parties.??
Adam Helps has so far raised $950,000 CAD ??which is roughly typical for Canadian seed rounds. According to founder Adam McLeod, this gives them enough runway to survive until Spring 2018.
Interestingly, the company has also a second separate fund, and for every successfully completed job undertaken on the platform, it donates $20 to a local charity ($10 in the name of the person who posted the job, and $10 for the person who completed the task). ?úFor every completed task the person who posted the job and the person who completed the job are prompted to vote for one of 4 local grassroots charities.  Each votes converts to a $20 donation that the Adam Helps team makes towards the chosen charity,??McLeod explained. 
In many respects, Adam Helps embodies the values people associate with Canadians ??friendliness, community-mindedness, and just being nice. This is something that came up in my conversation with company founder Adam McLeod. He said that doing good is ?úintrinsic??to Adam Helps??brand identity, and that its overall goal is to ?úbuild strong communities by helping each other out.??
Sadly though, there are no immediate plans to expand out of Canada, with McLeod saying ?úwe plan on branching out of Canada when it makes sense to do so. Canada is a great place to start a project like this because the people are friendly and warm to the idea of helping each other out. Once we?ôre successful here we?ôll look at where we can go next.??

351,apps,"Chrome aside, Slack has easily become the app I most frequently use; and while I generally have no squabbles with it, the team collaboration messenger continues to suffer from a rage-inducing bug that sporadically causes it to crash when using the drag-and-drop image upload feature.
The worst part is how little it takes to trigger this annoying flaw: sometimes I would be casually dragging an image to drop in Gmail and a mere hover over Slack would be enough to abruptly reboot it.
For those who?ôve been fortunate not to encounter this glitch, here is a little demo:

As someone who spends hours behind the screen pretty much everyday, I?ôve grown quite accustomed to using my favorite apps despite the occasional bug ??mostly because I know there is a fix on the way. But this doesn?ôt seem to be the case here.
Back in October, I went on a similar rant, calling out Slack for ignoring a well-known shortcoming in its software despite numerous complaints from angered users dating back as far as April.
For the record, Slack has confirmed the issue with the users on more than one occasion, including in April, May, August, September and October. Each single time it has promised a fix in the near future. But this future is yet to arrive.
As I explained in my previous rant, the drag-and-drop feature would work as intended most of the times, but when it doesn?ôt ??it could really mess up your workflow, especially when uploading images tends to be a regular part of your work. It also appears to be limited strictly to Mac, not that this makes things better.
Following my call-out in October, Slack swiftly replied to the criticism on Twitter, assuring us one more time their developers ?úhave a fix for this bug in our next big app update.??

To that end, it?ôs worth trying the new duospaced font from the folks behind iA Writer. The Zurich-based team that made the popular writing app for mobile and macOS set out to create a font that?ôs better for writing than for reading ??one that allows enough space for your eyes to scan through words and letters at your preferred pace.

The company already offered a monospaced font called Nitti in its app, which fit each and every character the same amount of horizontal space. In its quest to create a better alternative, it decided to explore a duospaced option that gives 50 percent more space to the letters m, M, w and W. Here?ôs an example from iA that shows the difference between monospace and duospaced fonts:
Credit: iA
According to iA, that fixes the problem of squishing those traditionally wide letters into awkward spaces, while creating a better flow and retaining all the benefits of monospaced screen fonts: ?úthe draft like look, the discernibility of words and letters, and the right pace for writing.??
iA Writer Duospace is built on IBM?ôs handsome and functional new Plex typeface, which it unveiled and made open-source earlier this month. The best part: both are available for you to download and use in your preferred text editor for free.
I?ôve now grown accustomed to writing with Simplenote and its default font, but I gave iA?ôs duospaced font a go with Sublime Text and came away impressed by how much more legible it was, even on color schemes with dark backgrounds. That makes for easier scanning for errors, while also encouraging you to take your time as you write.
Give iA Writer Duospace a go by downloading its four weights from this GitHub repository, or by firing up the latest version of iA Writer for macOS and iOS. IBM?ôs Plex fonts are available here.

It might also be useful for those who interact with plenty of groups, and shop through the social network.

In at least one country (Britain), and possibly more, the company could face huge fines for failing to notify its users and lawmakers of the breach.

358,apps,"More than 40 million people in the US alone suffer from depression and anxiety. Less than 15 percent of those will receive treatment. To call this an epidemic would be an understatement. One company, Ginger.io, is hoping to make a difference through its app, which brings professional mental healthcare to anyone with a smartphone.
Ginger.io is a licensed healthcare practice with a nationwide medical practice. It?ôs app allows people to get immediate access to mental health professionals that range from coaches who use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) guidelines, to practicing doctors who can write prescriptions.
With the app, users can chat with their coaches anytime and schedule a video chat with a licensed therapist. The therapist, if they see an urgent need, can at any time escalate a patient to the care of a doctor ??also through video chat.
One of the driving forces behind Ginger.io is machine learning. In a testament to the power of machines to augment human interactions, the company uses AI to ?úidentify symptoms, direct people to the right type of care, personalize the experience, and map outcomes and progress.??
It accomplishes this through using CBT guidelines as a data set and having its own proprietary algorithms do the heavy research and recommendations ??thus freeing up your coaches to focus on you. It?ôs a clever system that appears to truly provide access to professional mental healthcare anywhere at any time, at least in the US.
There are, however, some challenges still to overcome. Ginger.io isn?ôt free, which means that some of the people who could most benefit from the app ??like 45 million impoverished Americans ??don?ôt really have access.
The company has tried to mitigate this issue by working with insurers and offering employer services.
In the argument for companies to provide a system like Ginger.io as a benefit, there?ôs a lot of research indicating it?ôs cost-effective to provide mental healthcare access to employees. Just sayin??
But perhaps largest obstacle for therapy seekers is the stigma surrounding mental healthcare. Every expert we?ôve spoken to ??from Woebot?ôs mom to the creators of Ginger.io ??agree that society is suffering from a negative view towards seeking help.
With an app like Ginger.io the process becomes much simpler. You don?ôt have to get a referral or talk to anyone else about your mental healthcare. You don?ôt have to leave your home, which is huge for people who have difficulty traveling.
Users also have access to their care team no matter where they go in the US, which means you don?ôt have to wait until after the holidays to talk to your coach, even if you?ôre traveling. It also means that if you have a major life change and end up moving away you won?ôt have to get a new therapy team.
Ginger is important, perhaps even necessary, because everyone has mental health. I highly recommend trying it out if you?ôre looking for an emotional support system. The app is free to download, but you?ôll have to subscribe to use it beyond the initial trial.
The subscription plans for Ginger.io cost $129, $249, and $349, depending on how much access you want to licensed therapists and psychiatrists.
If you?ôre seeing a bit of sticker shock (most apps on our phones have subscription fees like 20 bucks a month) that?ôs understandable, but consider this: most therapists in the US charge between $75 and $150 per visit. Those of us who live in rural areas or other places without immediate access to providers can add travel expenses to those costs.
There?ôs never a bad time to start fighting depression and anxiety (especially now that the holidays have arrived).
You can check out Ginger.io here, it?ôs available on both iOS and Android.

361,apps,"This is bad. Google actively receives location data from Android users even when location services have been switched off.
Starting from early 2017, Android phones have been gathering addresses of nearby cellular towers and sending this data back to Google, Quartz reports. The most troubling part is that this has been going on even when users have disabled location services.
According to the publication, Android handsets collected location data pretty much all the time and subsequently relayed all stored information back to Google once connected to the internet. Quarts claims that all modern Android phones are affected by this vulnerability.
Cell tower addresses were collected by the same system that Google uses to manage push notifications and messages, a spokesperson for the company told Quartz. While this has been going on for 11 months so far, the spokesperson insisted none of the data has been stored or used.
Following the coverage, the Mountain View heavyweight has vowed to take measures to prevent this from happening in the future, promising the issue will be fully eliminated by the end of November.
?úIn January of this year, we began looking into using Cell ID codes as an additional signal to further improve the speed and performance of message delivery,??the Google spokesperson said. ?úHowever, we never incorporated Cell ID into our network sync system, so that data was immediately discarded, and we updated it to no longer request Cell ID.??
While location data from a single cell tower will only reveal an approximation of where a device is, pulling data from multiple towers could be used to triangulate a handset?ôs location to within a quarter-mile radius.
Curiously, Google does indeed mention it gleans location data, but does not state whether this is the case when location services have been disabled.
When you use Google services, we may collect and process information about your actual location. We use various technologies to determine location, including IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide Google with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.
This marks the second time in recent months the search giant has been caught collecting user data under questionable circumstances.
Earlier in October, numerous distressed netizens took to Reddit to warn fellow Android users that Google has an Activity Recognition API that allows third-party apps to track your physical activity ??even when your device is offline.
?úYou cannot disable the Play services as they have system-privileges on stock Android, but basically all devices not sold within China use them.??Smarter:Time CTO Anis Fehri told TNW over email.
?úWe can confirm that the ActivityRecognition algorithms work offline, but do not know if any of that data is sent to Google servers (they probably do not need it, they already have access to our geolocation, again through the Play services).??
Unlike the location data received by cell towers though, there is a way to stop Google from collecting your activity data.

It remains unclear how widely spread the issue is, but so far users have reported spotting Quik appear on Mate 10 Pro, Honor 9 and a few other models. Huawei said it couldn?ôt offer a definitive number.
The worst part is that it seems the issue is not strictly limited to the Netherlands. Data sourced from app analytics software AppAnnie shows that Spanish, Russian, Italian and French users are also experiencing the same issue.

Curiously, earlier this year Huawei and GoPro announced that Quik will be integrated into Huawei?ôs EMUI 5.1 OS as part of a new partnership.

365,apps,"You might be more familiar with Chrome, Firefox, and Opera than UC Browser, but the Chinese Android app has clocked more than half a billion downloads on Google Play. Sadly, you might now learn the name only because it?ôs been removed from the Play store.
When contacted about booting UCWeb?ôs browser, Google told the Economic Times that it removes apps that violate its policies that are designed to provide ?úa safe and positive experience for users.??Meanwhile, the Alibaba-owned firm said in a statement:
The exact reason for UC Browser?ôs unavailability on Google Play is because of a certain setting of UC Browser that was not in line with Google?ôs policy. The reason for the removal has nothing to do with alleged data security breach or malicious promotion.
It?ôs strange that UCWeb didn?ôt care to specify what that certain setting ??and stranger still that its parent company UC Union sent out an email to businesses signed up on its affiliate program a week ago, asking them not to use ?òMalicious Promotion methods??to garner new users for the browser. Android Police noted that it had signed up for the program previously and had received this message.
For its part, UCWeb said that it?ôs made the necessary fix to its app and has submitted it for review to Google; it expects to be back on the Play store next week. Until then, the app is also available to sideload from its site.
But if it?ôs not good enough for Google, then it might make sense to hold off on downloading or using the browser until the matter is resolved. It isn?ôt clear whether the browser is collecting more data from your device than it should, or forwarding along your browsing activity to servers back home.
While getting kicked off Google Play is plenty of cause for concern, it doesn?ôt help much when you?ôre cagey with the details about why it happened. Hopefully, UCWeb will be more transparent about such incidents with users in the future.

366,apps,"Facebook has rolled out Creator, a new app for video broadcasters on its platform, to enhance their content with custom graphics, and tools to interact with their audience better.
The mobile app (available now for iOS, with an Android version in the works), will let you add intros and outros to your Live broadcasts, as well as graphic frames and stickers through the duration of your stream. There are also additional camera effects to play around with.

A new Commnuity tab features a unified inbox so you can see all your comments from Facebook and Instagram, as well as messages from Messenger. In addition, you can now access analytics about your Facebook Page, videos, and your viewers.
The launch of Creator signals a larger push from Facebook into the video space. Beyond empowering amateur content creators, the tool is also intended to be used to by people producing shows for the company?ôs Watch video service, which launched in August with the likes of Nas Daily and Gabby Bernstein.
It?ôs also worth noting that Facebook has been testing another tool called Fan Club App to help video creators garner larger audiences on its platform. However, it seems at present that the two apps will work independently of each other.
That should help Facebook battle YouTube to gain more viewers, but it remains to be seen just how many people take to the social network to watch more episodic content and livestreams over time. A big part of how this will play out will depend not only on the tools each platform offers, but also the size of the audiences and the cut that creators get from ad revenue.
Facebook Creator is available now from the App Store, and will arrive for Android in the coming months.

After all, who wants to get constant notifications to help out with a friend?ôs crops? But app invites were an essential part of early Facebook life, for many of us ??mostly as a thing we had to live with.
Now, Facebook is slowly phasing the feature out. According to the developer page, the feature will be completely unsupported by February 6, 2018.
Facebook is also deprecating a few other features at the same time. This includes third-party Like buttons, which means that you?ôll no longer be able to ?úLike??a page while you?ôre in another app. You?ôll have to visit the actual Facebook page. Other features getting the boot include the now-redundant Follow button and comment mirroring, which allows you to comment on offsite content using your Facebook account.

369,apps,"WhatsApp rolled out push-to-talk voice messages back in 2013, but the Facebook subsidiary has done little to improve the feature since then ??until now. The popular messenger is experimenting with a feature to record voice messages without having to hold that irritating button, WABetaInfo has noticed.
Here is how it will work: once you start recording a voice message, WhatsApp will display a new sliding interface for the microphone button. After approximately half a second, users will see an option to swipe up to lock into recording mode, allowing them to speak to their phones without holding the button.
WABetaInfo shared some images of the new interface:

Perhaps most handy is the ability to browse through your previous messages while talking ??in case you need to double-check what you?ôre talking about or make a reference to a previously discussed point.
Now, there are some restrictions when using the swipe-to-talk functionality. For one, you won?ôt be able to view images or videos while in lock mode (though iPhone users could take advantage of the 3D Touch feature to pre-view them). It?ôs also impossible to type out texts in locked mode.
Another limitation is that you can?ôt turn to other chats while in locked mode; doing so purportedly causes the recordings to get automatically deleted.
Meanwhile, those curious to see how the revamped swipe-to-talk voice messages can check out this demo video obtained by WABetaInfo.
The popular WhatsApp insider says the feature is currently being tested, but should become available in upcoming updates, once the company has managed to get it to work smoothly.

The new Teletype feature lets you team up with fellow developers on a project and write or edit code together at the same time, with individual cursors and zero latency.

GitHub notes that you?ôll be able to use your own key bindings, packages, and themes while working with Teletype, so you won?ôt feel like you?ôre using someone else?ôs IDE. The company also notes that your data is piped through encrypted peer-to-peer connections, so you shouldn?ôt have to worry about anyone snooping on your code.
It?ôs still in beta, so it doesn?ôt include certain other allied features that would make collaboration easier, like a chat window so you can discuss changes and additions with your team in the same app. Hopefully, this sort of functionality will be added in the future.

The course teaches the basics of the language, including the four main tones and 1,000 common characters. The course?ôs designer, Masato Hagiwara, points out that Chinese can be a difficult language to learn and the course was designed with that in mind: ?úGiven that it?ôs so widely spoken, we wanted to ensure that we developed a course that teaches the language as effectively as possible, especially to those who are beginners.??
The themes of the course include greetings, occupation, food, and health. There is also a series of phrases centered on business. According to Hagiwara:
Since China is a major business and financial hub, many people will benefit from learning business-focused phrases to more effectively communicate in professional settings. Our course provides a set of ??authentic business lessons that teach practical sentences such as, ?úHave you read the contract I sent you???and ?úWe would like to invest in your company.??
One of my favorite series of questions in the course relates to China?ôs popular social media apps. For example, you can learn to ask someone if you can chat with them on WeChat. Considering it has around 980 million monthly users (according to its third quarter report), it?ôs likely anyone you meet in China has a WeChat account.

Last month, a man was arrested in Japan on suspicion of murdering nine people. Based on Twitter accounts linked to him, he may have lured in vulnerable victims by targeting those who expressed suicidal thoughts on Twitter, reaching out to them professing sympathy. Their bodies were found in his home.
Yesterday, Jack Dorsey gave his first on-camera opinion on the topic to Japanese site NHK, where he said, ?úWe need to take on a responsibility to make sure that our tool is being used in positive and healthy ways.??At the same time, some officials in Japan are calling for stricter regulations on sites like Twitter where suicidal people might express their thoughts.
Earlier this month, Twitter updated its policy, with one of the changes being clearer rules regarding tweets about self-harm. According to the new rules:
You may not promote or encourage suicide or self-harm. When we receive reports that a person is threatening suicide or self-harm, we may take a number of steps to assist them, such as reaching out to that person and providing resources such as contact information for our mental health partners.
A Twitter spokesperson told the LA Times: ?úWe did not rewrite the section on suicide and self harm because of this case, but we would like to avoid these types of cases from happening.??
I?ôm not sure what else Twitter could do, honestly. I?ôm all for holding large sites accountable for what people use them for, and deleting tweets promoting self-harm is commendable. But, as Dorsey points out in the same interview, it likely won?ôt stop anyone from committing suicide.
Hopefully these updates will help prevent people from being preyed on as this person?ôs victims allegedly were.

Over the next few weeks users will be introduced to new color keys and icons depending on the category, such as orange for food and drink and pink for health. This comes as an upgrade to the old design, where it was easy to mix things up as icons were small and similar in color.
The idea is that now users can easily spot what they?ôre looking for. For example, if you?ôre out of town and have an accident, you can quickly spot a pink icon on the map and get to hospital.
In addition, Google will provide specific maps for different functions, depending if you?ôre driving, using public transport or simply exploring. If you?ôre driving, the map will be able to direct you to the nearest gas stations. In the case that you?ôre using public transport, the nearest train station or bus stop.
The update will first be available in all Google products that incorporate Google Maps: the Assistant, Search, Earth, and Android Auto, and eventually apps and websites that use the Google Maps API.
Google?ôs aim is to keep its maps updated and useful for its users, and hopes to achieve this with its newest updates.

The results from the postal survey revealed that 79.5 percent of eligible voters had their say. An overwhelming 62 percent voted to allow same-sex marriage, while 38 percent were against any change to current legislation.
It?ôs now time for the current Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, to introduce a private member?ôs bill to amend the current Marriage Act. Members of parliament will then be allowed to freely vote for or against the bill. Thankfully, Turnbull wants this to be a quick process:
And they have voted overwhelmingly ?úYes??for marriage equality. They voted ?úYes??for fairness. They voted ?úYes??for commitment. They voted ?úYes??for love. And now it is up to us, here in the Parliament of Australia, to get on with it. To get on with the job the Australian people have tasked us to do, and get this done, this year, before Christmas.
While there?ôs definitely no guarantee the law will change, Turnbull?ôs prediction is that it will. Let?ôs hope the Australian Parliament listens closely to the ?òYES??majority because I can imagine a lot worse than a humiliating art installation if they don?ôt??
Either way, this is a historic step forward for Australia. Hopefully, by Christmas, marriage equality will finally be a reality.

376,apps,"Spotify is one of the most used music streaming apps in the world ??as of June this year it had 140 million active users.
But for an app so widely used, a lot of its better features are hidden. This is an issue that Spotify has been tackling for a while, and although its taken steps to and continues to improve its UX, it?ôs still lacking that flow.
Some of these features have to do with user interaction, while others with the music itself. I?ôve listed some of my favorites to share:
1. Improve sound quality
Spotify lets you listen to your music on higher quality, both on streaming and downloaded songs. Downside: it takes up more storage and consumes more data in the case of streaming. Still totally worth it ??there?ôs nothing worse than listening to a low-quality electric guitar
You can access this by going on Settings ?? Music Quality, then you have the option to choose from Normal to Extreme.

2. Make playlist folders (Desktop only)
Ever wanted to group all your Chill playlists in one folder? The desktop version of Spotify lets you create folders into which you can then drag and drop different playlists. I use it for ?úSeasons,??as I make different playlist each season. Even though you can only be created on the desktop, you can still access the folders from the mobile app.
You can do this simply by going to File ?? New Playlist Folder
3. Search for specific songs within a playlist, or filter
If you drag down on a playlist or artist, you can search for specific songs, place filters or even order songs in different ways. Then, order by Artist or Song Title.
When you drag down, simply type in the search box, or press the burger menu on the right to access filters.
4. Get back a playlist you deleted
If you?ôve accidentally pressed delete on one of your playlists, there?ôs still hope. That playlist you?ôd spent so long carefully curating is back in your power. There are many times I wish I?ôd known this before ??after spending hours recreating a playlist trying to remember each and every song that was on it.
To do this head over to Spotify?ôs Account section on their website ?? Account Settings and select Recover Playlists. Voila! It?ôs back.
5. Go to Song or Artist Radio and find similar tunes
The Radio feature on Spotify makes a playlists with similar artists or songs. The feature now comes automatically when what you?ôre listening to is finished ??be it a playlist, artist or album. This is great when you?ôre trying to figure out what else to add to a playlist that fits a certain mood, or even to discover new artists that are similar to what you?ôre listening to at the moment. It?ôs similar to the Genius option on iTunes.
To access, simply pick the Radio option on your app or sidebar on desktop.
6. Turn on private listening mode
For those users who don?ôt have Premium, they will have to keep an eye on this as you?ôll have to set it up every once in a while. In settings, you can choose to keep your songs private ??you?ôll be able to listen to all your guilty pleasures without everyone finding out.
You can listen in peace by going to File (Windows) / Spotify (Mac) ?? Private Session

7. Discover Weekly ??made just for you
This is one of my favorites. Every week, Spotify curates a playlist for you with music that you could be interested in. So far, the algorithm has improved greatly, and I?ôve been able to discover new songs and artists that go along with my taste.
You can access this from your Discover section on your Spotify.
With these, your daily experience with Spotify should be a little better ??and inspire you to keep on searching for hidden gems within the service.

To provide accurate stats, the Big G will source data from popular careers platforms like Glassdoor, PayScale and LinkedIn. Job listings that already include a salary indication will show a comparison to the estimated remuneration range for the position in question.
Google has also revamped its location filters to make it easier for users to see vacancies exclusively within their preferred range of distance ??starting from two and going all the way up to 200 miles.

One thing I find especially handy is that, in the event that the same vacancy is listed on more than careers platforms like Monster or CareerBuilder, Google will give you the choice to select through which website you want to apply.

378,apps,"Having used Chrome for ages, I?ôve gotten used to the browser?ôs sluggish performance and gluttony for system memory, and I?ôve a feeling I?ôm not alone.
With the launch of Firefox Quantum, we can finally break free from those shackles: the latest version of Mozilla?ôs browser uses an all-new CSS engine and memory management techniques to load pages faster and handle piles of tabs better than Google?ôs offering.
I?ôm making the switch today, and you can join me by following these simple steps to transition painlessly from Chrome to Firefox Quantum in under two minutes.
Head to this page to get the installer for Mac, Linux and Windows, and follow the on-screen instructions to set it up. It should only take a couple of clicks.
Once you?ôve got the browser installed, you can either start afresh with Firefox Quantum or bring over all your settings, bookmarks, history and passwords from Chrome.
The easiest way to do so is to open the Bookmarks Library by hitting Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+B, and then clicking on Import and Backup > Import Data from Another Browser to launch the wizard. Then, choose Chrome (or whichever other browser you?ôre migrating from); select the items you?ôd like to import, and you?ôre good to go.
Quantum?ôs interface is more sparse than previous versions, so you might need some time to get used to it. For starters, you can now enter search terms in the address bar, and that field now has a contextual button with three dots that contains shortcuts to functions like bookmarking, taking a screenshot, emailing the link, and sending the current tab to a synced device that also has Firefox installed.
You can set up the main toolbar just the way you like by clicking the hamburger menu button all the way on the right and then choosing Customize. Once there, you can add and remove buttons, and the search box (which is useful if you want to query search engines other than the default one, aka Google).
Additionally, you can hide the title bar, show or hide toolbars like the one for bookmarks, configure the size and spacing of buttons, and even switch up themes by clicking the buttons at the bottom of this screen.
There are a couple of bland ones built in, as well as a dark theme and a few whimsical options. Firefox has long had a theme store where you can browse and add more to your collection, and you can access it from this page.
To save your changes and return to your browser, click Done at the bottom of the page.
Quantum has a couple of nice new tricks up its sleeve, including a built-in screenshot tool that lets you snap the visible portion of a page, the entire page, or just any area you choose. It?ôs accessible from the three-dots menu in the address bar, and it?ôll automatically upload your screenshot so you can share it online, download the image, or copy it to your clipboard by hitting Ctrl/Cmd+V.
The browser also has Pocket baked in, so you can easily save pages to read later with just a click on the address bar. You?ôll need to sign into the service before it starts working, of course.
Alternatively, you can use any other read-later service you like, such as Instapaper, but you?ôll need to install the necessary add-on to do so (and you can then hide the Pocket button by right-clicking it and choosing the option to remove it).
Firefox?ôs browser is also available on iOS and Android, and you can have those versions keep your passwords, bookmarks and history in sync with your desktop browsing activity. Plus, you can beam any active page from your computer to your phone by clicking the option in the three-dots menu.

To enable these features, click the hamburger menu button and choose the first option to set up Sync; you?ôll need to create an account with your email address and password. Once that?ôs done, login to your account in Firefox on your phone, and you?ôre good to go.
Chrome and Firefox are similar in the way they handle New Tabs and your start page. You can set them up in Quantum just as you did in Chrome by clicking the hamburger menu button and choosing Options, and configuring these settings under General.

I personally enjoy using a customized self-hosted page that contains links to all the sites I frequently browse as my home and start page, so I?ôve got that set up for both options. You can learn how to create your own here.
To configure how New Tabs behave, start by opening a fresh tab by clicking the + button on the tab bar or by hitting Ctrl/Cmd+T. You?ôll find a list of ?òTop Sites??that you visit often, and you can add or remove pages from there at will.
Next, click the gear icon at the top right of the page to show or hide the search bar, bookmarked pages in the Highlights section, and snippets of info that Firefox will surface from time to time.
While you may not find the exact same extensions you use in Chrome, there are plenty to choose from in Firefox?ôs store that should help replicate most of the functionality you?ôre used to in Google?ôs browser.
Here are a few essential add-ons, and some of my favorites that are worth installing in Quantum:
If you?ôre happy with your new setup and want to make Quantum your daily driver, click the hamburger menu button, and click ?òMake Default?¶‚Ä?so it always launches instead of Chrome whenever you need a browser from a different app.
And that?ôs how you switch from Chrome to Firefox Quantum, and reclaim precious system resources in the bargain. Happy browsing!

Ad Age reports that Amazon is prepping a free ad-supported version of its Prime Video streaming service, which could help it take on rivals like Netflix, Hulu and YouTube.
Prime Video is bundled with Amazon?ôs premium shipping service, which costs $99 a year or $10.99 a month in the US. It includes syndicated movies and TV shows, as well as original content produced by Amazon.
The move to offer a free tier could make a lot of sense, given that Amazon has multiple competitors battling to become the replacement of choice as more households ditch traditional cable services. As of this July, Amazon is believed to have 85 million customers signed up for its Prime service in the US; numbers from June indicate that Netflix has about 50 million subscribers there, while cable companies count about 48.6 million subscribers nationwide in total.
Netflix intends to grow its spend on production to a whopping $8 billion next year, in a bid to stock 50 percent of its catalog with original content. And in February, Google announced YouTube TV, a service to rival cable with plans starting at $35 a month and numerous channels on offer. In May, Hulu began offering 50 live channels for $40 a month. Even Facebook has been getting in on the game with its Watch service that delivers episodic content.
Meanwhile, Amazon has already begun experimenting in a limited capacity with ads (you can spot them in NFL games) and brand integrations on Prime Video. And as a business that?ôs growing to serve more international (and cost-conscious) markets like India, it makes sense to explore ways to serve up streaming media without a subscription fee.
The company is believed to have plans to share ad revenue as well as viewership data with partnered content creators. That could give it an edge over some rivals once the service is launched. At the same time, cable is far from dead, as a recent report shows that 18-34 year-olds in the US still watch 10 times more traditional TV on average than Netflix. This war is far from over.

Rescam is an AI bot that sends authentic-sounding automated replies to phishers??messages, tying them up in the process of chasing a lead. It works with Nigerian princes, deceased dukes, philanthropic trusts, and even lotteries you haven?ôt entered ??and it doesn?ôt cost you a dime.

To use it, just forward a scammy message to me@rescam.org from your inbox, and sit back and watch the fun. Rescam will check if the email is indeed fraudulent, and then proceed to reply with a message that sounds like it could?ôve come from a real person. I tried it by sending myself a notice from a separate address to collect $10 million from a lucky draw, and Rescam got on the case in a couple of days:

It even with worked with a clever ploy run by someone claiming to represent the Central Bank of Nigeria, who wanted to compensate me for previously falling victim to an email scam. Oh, the irony.

It appears that the length of Rescam?ôs conversations depends on whether the scammers reply. But it?ôs fascinating to see the AI accurately address the subject matter in the emails, and it?ôs endlessly amusing ??and satisfying ??to think that you might be drawing a trickster into a wild goose chase with just a few keystrokes.
Rescam is a project dreamed up by Netsafe, a New Zealand-based non-profit focused on online safety for people and businesses. It?ôs the organization?ôs latest attempt at tackling the global phishing crisis, which sees people lose more than $12 billion a year to such scams each year. Netsafe notes that the more people use Rescam, the more effective its bot will be in culling phishing scammers over time. Let?ôs hope the NGO is right, and that its bot catches on worldwide to become the nightmare of scammers everywhere.
Scam baiting, the act of trolling scammers by pretending to fall for their schemes in order gather information about them or waste their time, has been going on for a long time now, and many a noble internet vigilante took it upon themselves to expose these frauds. Thanks to AI like Rescam, they can now shuck off their boots and leave the dirty work to these clever bots.

The company has been contacting developers of apps that rely on the Accessibility Services API for functions like filling in text fields and detecting if other apps are open, to ask them to restrict their usage only for functions that assist users with disabilities. Failure to explain the need for the API in this regard will result in the app being removed from Google Play.
That?ôs a bummer for fans of apps like LastPass, Tasker, Cerberus, and Universal Copy, all of which use the aforementioned API. The developers will either have to figure out workarounds for their apps or remove certain functions in order to avoid being booted from the Play store. Some features, like LastPass??ability to autofill passwords, can make use of newer allowances in the latest version of Android, but that means that they won?ôt work on devices running older versions of the platform.
The problem that Google is trying to solve is the potential security risk involved in allowing apps to read data from other apps by using the API. Unfortunately, the solution might mean reduced functionality in Android: I use LastPass extensively to fill passwords across apps and sites, and given that I switch phones every couple of weeks for reviews, I don?ôt know how I?ôll get by without it.
We?ôve contacted Google to learn more and will update this post if there?ôs a response.

Available for free on Android and iOS, South Park: Phone Destroyer sees you take on the role of the new kid in town, in a game of cowboys against Native Americans. You play the cowboys, obviously. Gameplay consists of dealing cards featuring characters from the game, each with different classes and abilities that help them dish out punishment to the opposing side.

The game doesn?ôt bother to reinvent the wheel when it comes to card-based RPGs, but its presentation is sure to delight fans of Trey Parker and Matt Stone?ôs beloved cartoon. You can watch the battles unfold on screen as you play your cards, manage your energy, use special abilities, and strategize your way to victory. There are both player-vs.-AI and player-vs.-player battles to engage in, though you?ôre better off tackling others a little later on in the game, once you?ôve got enough resources to bring to the table.
You can customize and level up your card deck, spend on in-app purchases to get new card packs, and score rewards to use in future battles. As with most free games, there are several microtransactions to deal with, but you can get in plenty of play without spending any real money.
Overall, Phone Destroyer is a fun take on the card-based battle genre, and the interface and gameplay work well to create a satisyfying experience ??even if you?ôre not a huge fan of South Park. Just try not to empty your savings in your quest to defeat every other player you encounter.

Verification was meant to authenticate identity & voice but it is interpreted as an endorsement or an indicator of importance. We recognize that we have created this confusion and need to resolve it. We have paused all general verifications while we work and will report back soon
??Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) November 9, 2017

The blue badge might not have been conceived as anything prestigious. Going by Twitter?ôs own comments, the point is simply to ensure followers know for sure certain accounts are who or what they say they are.
Trouble is, when you create a system where certain people are granted a thing others can?ôt have by virtue of popularity or fame ??that makes the thing a mark of prestige by default no matter what it is. Which explains why the responses to the Twitter Support tweet are all some variation on ?úYou verified Party X but not me, so clearly it was broken.??
That?ôs not to say that the people who said that shouldn?ôt have been verified ??it?ôs to say Twitter hasn?ôt made it clear exactly what verification is, let alone who?ôs going to get it.
For example, Twitter says in their tweet that verification ?úis interpreted as an endorsement or an indicator of importance,??implying that it didn?ôt intend for the badge to be seen that way. But its own description of verification says the company preemptively verifies accounts it deems notable.

So if it?ôs not an indicator of importance, then how does Twitter determine which accounts are notable? Surely it?ôs by some measure of their cultural importance. The guidelines mentioned above specify that accounts which might be imitated are preemptively verified, but not that documented accounts of imitation are necessary, which muddies the waters further.
To be clear, I?ôm in favor of a clearer guideline for verification. There are some cases where it makes sense to ensure tweets are coming from legitimate sources, which means there still might be a case for verification.

Currently, the integrated game with the highest profile is Call of Duty: World War II. Other games include Killing Floor 2, Payday 2, and Divinity: Original Sin 2.

Behold:

Truong is a prolific developer of fart apps. Over email, he told me that his ?úintention in writing the fart app is basically that whenever I come across a new technology I think it?ôs fun to mess with expectations and do something completely useless with it. I think it started when I wrote a fart app for Google Glass and kind of kept snowballing as I wrote fart apps for the Apple Watch and the Macbook Pro Touch Bar.??
His experiences in programming virtual flatulence even led him to write a guide for other prospective fart app developers: On Writing Successful Fart Apps. In it, he postulates that fart apps are the simplest non-trivial app you can write for any new platform, because ?úit touches the UI, the file system and whatever mechanism there is for playing an audio file.??
In other words, a great way to learn the basics of programming for different platforms.
Truong also responds to critics of his earlier work. ?úSome people take themselves way too seriously to enjoy a good fart app,??he writes about commenters who focus on perceived immaturity, cutting them off with a double whammy of rhetorical questions: ?úIs it just the subject matter that makes the project immature and pathetic? Like, would a British PM Soundboard be any more appropriate???
His guide continues with some more practical pointers for aspiring creators. ?úFirst off, you need to actually be the first to market on the fart app scene as interest will surely wane as the second, third, fourth, etc fart apps written for the technology are released. Unless you add something really cool, like actual fart smells in addition to sounds, then you probably wanna rush your fart app to market,??Get it out quick. 
?úSecond, you?ôll need to market your app with some kind of video,??especially when creating apps for hardware that very few people have, like Google Glass or the iPhone X. ?úYou can assume that no one will have the hardware or be interested in installing your app, so just make a video! In my experience, it helps if you mumble a lot.??
The last tip is that you should share your code on Github with a generous license. ?úYour app won?ôt be worth anything anyway, so you might as well share it,??Truong knowingly adds.
In line with his philosophy, his iPhone X app FacefARt, works with the cutting-edge TrueDepth front-facing camera and ARKit to make the user?ôs face fart when they open their mouth. According to his own Github, it?ôs ?úThe world?ôs most advanced fart app. Ever.??Which might just be true.

One thing that we have heard over the years is that Snapchat is difficult to understand or hard to use, and our team has been working on responding to this feedback. As a result, we are currently redesigning our application to make it easier to use.
Speaking as someone who?ôs done their best to explain the ins and outs of Snapchat and still finds it annoying to use sometimes, the app has long lived and died on the idea that it?ôs something you have to just ?úget.??If you don?ôt, you obviously must not fall into its young, hip user demographic.

The functionality essentially helps you better plan your visit to the cafeteria so you can avoid busy periods and roll in right when the rush hours have ended.
Users can take advantage of this new functionality by selecting their restaurant of choice in Maps or Search. The estimated wait times are displayed in the expanded business listing under the Popular Times section.

Among other things, the new feature highlights the busiest time slots during the day as well the approximate time people spent waiting in queue.

To put this information together, the two companies covered more than 100,000 miles over the course of 4,000 hours using Google Street View cars.

For this to work, both the parent?ôs and child?ôs phones must have the app installed and paired.
According to Digital Trends, there?ôs a loophole in the app, stating image processing is not done locally on phones, as it would result in battery drainage and excessive processing power, although CEO Skowronski says that the goal is for this to be the case.

414,apps,"A couple of weeks ago, I used Uber for the first time. I?ôve written about Uber extensively for work, and I have an academic understanding of how the app works, but I?ôve never used it for myself before. There are two reasons for that: Until recently, Uber wasn?ôt allowed in the city where I live. Also, I own a car, and prefer to drive. I don?ôt have much of a use for Uber. Despite knowing about the company?ôs poor reputation, I liked it, and I understand why people use it.
When I touched down in Long Beach, California for TwitchCon a few weekends ago, I?ôd originally intended to install both Uber and Lyft and give them both a try in the interest of adventure. But my boyfriend?ôs plane landed about 20 minutes early, and I had only managed to set up my Uber account before we joined the surging masses eager to reach our hotel.
I took my first Uber at that point because I wasn?ôt about to stand in a throng of 150 people outside of a tiny airport, fiddling with my phone while trying to remember my credit card?ôs CVV. And after that, in the rush that was TwitchCon, I continued to use Uber mostly because I was lazy and it was already on my phone ??or at least, that was the reason at first.
In my time at TNW, I?ôve read and written a lot about Uber. Not much of it was wholly positive. Uber?ôs had a rough year, and it seems new allegations about some scandal or problem at the company arise weekly. So, with all that I know about the company, my sentimental side says I should have expected a bad time, or not used the app at all on principle. But I did anyway, and I was far from the only convention attendee who did so.
Knowing that Uber is a convenient app to use and actually taking advantage of that convenience are two different things. It was mind-blowing how easy it was. The drivers were pleasant, almost to a fault. While nothing would induce me to condone the company?ôs behavior, it was easy to be seduced into forgetting it when I was really in a hurry to get somewhere, which was almost all the time.
So I began to wonder: all of Uber?ôs faults and its flawed culture ??where it underpays drivers, spies on readers, and maintains a toxic internal environment ??does any of it matter when the product is good? Were these flaws what created the good product? How much does the average person care while trying to get somewhere at three a.m. and the person driving them is offering water and lollipops?
Going by Uber?ôs growth rates over the past year, I?ôm far from the only one who uses it in spite of its flaws. According to financials reported by Axios in August, the number of trips taken via Uber has risen by 150 percent over last year.
If one can?ôt separate a quality product from the problematic company that created it, then at a certain point, does convenience override righteous indignation? It did for me, and I understand now why so many riders feel the same way.

421,apps,"Yesterday, Facebook rolled out ?òStories??to FB Lite ??a version of its mobile app meant to minimize data consumption ??prompting us to ask: why?
Though my colleague Bryan Clark wrote the piece, I was the one who first pointed out the apparent irony: Facebook was rolling out an underused, data-heavy feature onto a version of the app that?ôs ostensibly meant to save data in emerging markets.
But then I realized that?ôs a pretty arrogant thing for me to say. Just because FB Lite is meant for emerging markets with tight data requirements doesn?ôt mean its users should miss out on important new features. Whether those features are popular isn?ôt really relevant.
For those not familiar, Facebook Lite is only accessible in markets where data usage is often big concern. You can find it in India, for example, but can?ôt get in on the Play Store in the US. To those of us who are lucky enough to live in places where data is affordable, FB Lite might just seem like a minimalist version of the app, pared down to the essentials. It?ôs appealing for its performance optimizations, and indeed, it?ôs extremely lightweight compared to the standard app.

Just take a look at the app sizes: While the standard Facebook app is 74.6 MB, FB Lite is only 1.6 MB. That?ôs because FB Lite is essentially a thin shell that asks Facebook?ôs servers to do all the actual heavy lifting. The APK is able to remain tiny even as the company adds new features because those features are essentially beamed down from Facebook?ôs servers rather than being built into the app itself.
That might suggest the FB Lite has very limited functionality, but actually using the app for a while (by downloading the APK from an external source) tells a different story. It?ôs not more minimal in any experiential way ??if anything, the standard app has a cleaner look ??is it?ôs simply ruthelessly optimized to conserve data:
Basically, everything about the app seems designed to make you aware of when Facebook is using up your data plan.
Despite this, most of the everyday functionality is still there when you want it. I can still watch videos on my feed, I can use the full set of reactions, I can use stickers in comments, and I even apply colorful backgrounds to my posts. Now, I can watch Stories too.
But Bryan suggested there was something counterproductive in bringing Stories to FB Lite given its target market?ôs data constraints. Considering few people seem to actually use Stories on Facebook, it seemed the move was motivated was eventual advertising revenue, as was seen with their immense success on Instagram.

While that might be true ??Facebook is a for-profit company, after all ??it doesn?ôt change the fact that FB Lite deserves the same features. It?ôs not like Stories automatically play on your feed, anyway. Other than tiny thumbnails at the top of your News Feed, Facebook doesn?ôt seem to pull in any data from stories unless you ask it to. Even if you?ôre conscious about data consumption, you can always access stories later when you have access to Wi-Fi.
Think what you may about Stories and how Facebook (and Instagram/WhatsApp) explicitly copied it from Snapchat, but it?ôs clear the feature is a big part of the platform?ôs future. Stories may not be all that popular on Facebook at this very moment, but now that Instagram?ôs Stories (which are extremely popular) are being integrated onto your News Feed too, the feature is definitely here to stay.
Like ?ôem or not, it?ôs only fair that all of Facebook?ôs users get to share in one of the company?ôs biggest changes.

The annoying thing is that, despite updating its FAQ page to notify users about the new functionality, it seems the Facebook-owned messenger has not yet rolled out the new feature to all users. So you ought to think twice before you start dropping text-bombs with reckless abandon.

WhatsApp insider WABetaInfo has obtained screenshots of the new functionality in action. Here?ôs what you should see:
There are a few things you should be mindful of when using the feature though. For one, WhatsApp warns that you can only recall texts up to seven minutes after sending them. Once that limit has passed, there is no way to purge the content of a text.
Another caveat is that, in order to successfully wipe messages, both the sender and the recipient must be using the latest version of WhatsApp and have ?òDelete for everyone??enabled.
The Facebook subsidiary warns that recipients might see messages that were recalled, but did not successfully delete. More worryingly, WhatsApp won?ôt notify senders in case the deletion request has failed. So you will have to keep an eye out yourself.

424,apps,"Google?ôs Android Studio 3.0 dev environment has just become available in the stable channel, with a few major changes and a bunch of small ones ??the most notable being built-in support for Kotlin and Java 8.
Google first announced that it would bake Kotlin compatibility into Android Studio back in May at its IO conference, and it?ôs nice to see that it?ôs finally here for everyone to play with. The open-source language allows for easier development with more concise code, while ensuring greater performance and interoperability with Java and C++. You can either start a project in Kotlin or convert Java project files into Kotlin with just a couple of clicks in the app.

Version 3 also adds support for more Java 8 libraries and language features like Lambda expressions, default and static interface methods, and method references. However, the experimental Jack compiler has been deprecated in lieu of the default toolchain, as it wasn?ôt fast enough. This YouTube clip explains how you can make the switch in your code.
Next, Android Studio has an updated Gradle plugin that the company says will improve build configuration times and sync speed for larger projects.
There?ôs also the new Android Profiler, which replaces the Android Monitor tool with a suite of tools for measuring your app?ôs CPU, memory, and network usage in real-time to closely inspect its performance, and spot memory leaks and performance issues early on in the build process.
You?ôll also find a couple more handy features, like the ability to debug APKs without building them from Android Studio projects, a new file explorer panel to browse the contents of your connected device, and two new module types for building Instant Apps (which can run on users??devices without having to be installed) more easily.
The previous version brought Firebase integration for the first time, and v3 now allows App Indexing in Firebase Assistant to help Google Search find and surface your app in results pages.
With that, Android Studio should feel even more comfortable for app devs who?ôve been working with the modern Kotlin language. You can download the latest version here, and find the complete release notes on this page.

425,apps,"Instagram is adding another wacky effect to its Stories camera, and it might be my favorite one yet. Say hello to ?òSuperzoom.??
It?ôs pretty much what it sounds like ??you select an area to zoom into it in a video. It?ôs sure to be used for a plethora of melodramatic videos, and Instagram even includes music to add to the effect. In other words,  you basically get to do this:

To give it a go just need to select Superzoom from the camera, and tap and hold to record. Alternatively, tap it once to create a 3-second Superzoom.
Considering Halloween is coming up, I?ôm sure it?ôll be used to a bunch of creepy-zoomy videos. To that effect, Instagram has also added 5 new themed faced filters, as well as a new sticker set. The new features should be rolling out today to Android and iOS.

426,apps,"This is pretty disturbing. Google engineer Felix Krause has detailed an alarming privacy setting in Apple?ôs iOS that enables iPhone apps with camera permission to surreptitiously take photos and videos of you ??without your knowledge.
Clarification: Krause has since contacted TNW to clarify that he conducts his security research work during off-hours and independently of Google.
The researcher notes that granting camera permission will enable apps to access both the front and the back camera of your device, photograph and record you at any time the app is in the foreground, upload this content immediately, and run real-time face detection to read your facial expressions.
All of this without any notice or indication that your iPhone is snapping images of your face. No sound, no light, no LEDs.
Krause has shared a short demonstration of the documented issue on YouTube. Check it out below:

The most troubling concern here is that this is how this privacy setting is expected to work by design. Indeed, all signs seem to suggest this is yet another case of the trite ?úIt?ôs a feature, not a bug??conundrum.
The most pressing issue is that anybody who chooses to exploit these permissions could scrape image data to locate users, find other existing photos of the device?ôs owner, and even watch you while you?ôre sitting on the toilet and livestream this spectacle for others to see.

Krause says there is little you can do to prevent this; though there are a few options, none of them would make for a particularly smooth and streamlined user experience.
One possibility is to equip your camera with covers. You can find numerous such accessories on Amazon. That, or you can revoke camera access for all apps ??but not without sacrificing some app functionality in the meanwhile, like taking and sending photos straight from apps.
The Googler has since disclosed this complication to Apple. He also took a moment to offer some tips on how the Big A can handle this issue in a more responsible manner. One such solution, for example, would be to make camera permissions temporary ??or at least add indicators to notify when the device is recording.
Interestingly, earlier this year Google discovered technical inconsistencies or vulnerabilities in competitors??products on a number of occasions. Over the past twelve months, the Big G found critical bugs in antivirus software for Macs as well as glaring flaws in Microsoft?ôs Edge and Internet Explorer browsers.
In the meantime, those curious to go through Krause?ôs disclosure in more detail can peruse his full blog post here.

427,apps,"Slack is finally catching up to rival collaboration apps with the introduction of its screen sharing feature. To make up for its tardiness, the company has baked in a few additional useful features that put it head and shoulders above the competition.
Fire it up by clicking the display icon while on a video or voice call with a contact, and they?ôll be able to see your entire screen. You can also allow others to doodle on the contents of your screen so as to highlight or draw attention to things like points on a chart. The doodles automatically fade away after a few seconds.

What?ôs especially neat is that you can also let others take over your desktop, just like a remote control app. They can click around, scroll through windows, and type when you grant access. That?ôs infinitely useful for when you?ôre poring over lengthy documents or complex design projects with a group.
In my brief test, I found Slack?ôs screen sharing tools to work flawlessly, with just a bit of lag between your actions and what happens on your caller?ôs screen. Other than that, the screen sharing doesn?ôt affect call quality, and doodling works smoothly. With all that, Slack offers a step up from the traditional screen sharing features available in rival collaboration and group chat apps.
The new features come from the folks behind Screenhero; Slack acquired the six-man team back in 2015 to enhance its screen sharing functionality. They only work on Slack?ôs Windows and Mac desktop apps for now ??but hopefully, screen sharing will eventually arrive on mobile (at least for spectators). You?ôll need to be on Slack?ôs paid plan for this to work though.
Hopefully, it?ôll negate the need for groups of Slack users to resort to trying other apps for the same tasks during remote meetings, and keep Slack?ôs growing competition ??from Microsoft Teams, Facebook?ôs Workplace, Atlassian?ôs Stride, Zoho Cliq, Flock, and Keybase?ôs Teams ??at bay.
Update 10/26: A perceptive reader pointed out the fact that this only works for people on Slack?ôs paid plan. We updated the post to reflect that. Thanks, perceptive reader!

Sonar was first announced as a donation from Microsoft to the JS Foundation back in June, as part of its ongoing commitment to befriending the open source community. It?ôs now ready for anyone to use on many kinds of sites including intranets and online stores, and developers are invited to join in and help make the tool better.
Enter your project?ôs URL, and Sonar will comb through it for accessibility, interoperability, performance, security and progressive web app-related issues. Once it?ôs done scanning, it?ôll list the errors it?ôs found and do its best to explain what?ôs going wrong, highlighting the errant code snippets and offering possible solutions. You can see the scan results for Sonar?ôs own site on this page.
Ant√≥n Molleda, a senior program manager for Microsoft Edge, explained that Sonar improves on the capabilities of other linting tools by executing your website code in a container instead of simply performing a static analysis for more accurate results, as well as allowing for integration with other services. And if you don?ôt care to use Sonar in your browser, you can also invoke its command-line interface.
Sonar is ready to use right now over on this page, and is getting more features soon, including a Visual Studio Code plug-in, options to customize rules in the web app, and support for additional rules to test for performance, accessibility and security.

430,apps,"Airbnb is betting big on automation. The company is currently developing a new AI system that will empower its designers and product engineers to literally take ideas from the drawing board and turn them into actual products almost instantaneously.
The AI-powered solution aims to simplify the overall product development routine by focusing on testing functional prototypes, rather than bouncing half-assed modules and components between different teams.
?úThe time required to test an idea should be zero.??said Airbnb design technology lead Benjamin Wilkins.
?úAs it stands now, every step in the design process and every artifact produced is a dead end,??the designer added. ?úWork stops whenever one discipline finishes a portion of the project and passes responsibility to another discipline.??
Seeking to reduce friction in the overall workflow, the popular house rental service came to the conclusion the best way to streamline its product development process would be to let machines get familiar with it.
One thing that made this task easier is that Airbnb already has a thoroughly documented design system, with numerous carefully defined components and guidelines. The next step was to feed the design system to the AI and let it classify its various components.
The assumption was that, once properly trained and fine-tuned, the AI would be able to recognize Airbnb?ôs standard hand-drawn design components and automatically render them into actual source code. To their surprise, the outcome was more than satisfactory.
Here is a demonstration from an early prototype of the AI-powered product development tool:
?úThis system has already demonstrated massive potential,??Wilkins shared with excitement.
?úWe?ôve experimented using the same technology to live-code prototypes from whiteboard drawings, to translate high fidelity mocks into component specifications for our engineers, and to translate production code into design files for iteration by our designers.??
Assuming things go according to plan, Wilkins believes AI-assisted prototyping would become an integral feature in future iterations of Airbnb?ôs in-house product development suite.
Those interested to hear more about these efforts can check out Wilkins??talk on the importance of symbolic thinking and streamlined design systems:

Meanwhile, Airbnb is not the only company toying with the idea to outsource design sketching to machines.
In fact, earlier this year Copenhagen-based startup Ulzard Technologies showcased software that can autonomously interpret raw product mockups and proceed to translate them into source code.
So in case you?ôre fed up with your moody dev team: soon you might have the option to replace them with robots.

431,apps,"Few things aggravate me as much as seeing unsolicited group chats in my WhatsApp conversation list.
You know what I?ôm talking about ??the one with all your third cousins that you got dragged into at your last family reunion, that other one with your former colleagues from the last place you worked at, where everyone wishes everyone a happy birthday, practically every day of the year. Where you have nothing to contribute, and only wish that you could leave these groups forever.
The worst part? There?ôs no way out ??at least, not without alerting everyone that you don?ôt care to be part of the group chat, hurting feelings, and risking the chance of being added back in by an over-enthusiastic participant who just doesn?ôt get the hint.

I?ôm a terrible person in so many ways, but I?ôd like that to be a secret. I?ôm happy to make an exception in your case, dear reader, but I?ôd rather my kith and kin didn?ôt find out just how uptight, snobbish and emotionally unavailable I can be.
I?ôm dreading writing this, because my extended family and former co-workers ??bless their hearts ??might read it, and know that I?ôm talking about the groups we share. I?ôm already a ghost in those conversations, lurking in the shadows and never saying a word.

In trying to create a simple way to talk to several people at once, WhatsApp has created an annoyance that?ôs practically impossible to avoid. Muting and archiving these conversations only helps so much. But seeing those groups every time you open the app, being reminded that you haven?ôt said anything to those people in ages, and risking mistakenly forwarding them a message because they also show up in WhatsApp?ôs suggestions, are all painful.
Is there a fix? Telegram lets you prevent anyone from adding you to a group, ??but that?ôs not an elegant solution. I prefer to keep that option off so that I can be added to some groups, like this one in which I?ôm planning a friend?ôs bachelor party with some mates of his.
The trouble with letting you sneak out of a group without letting anyone know is that it doesn?ôt serve the other participants well ??they won?ôt know that you?ôre no longer receiving messages, and will blame the service for faulty communications.
There is another way: you can already archive group chats, which makes them disappear from your conversation list until someone posts a new message. WhatsApp could tweak this functionality and hide the chat until you revisit it in a separate ?òarchived conversations??list, or only allow the chat to resurface if you?ôre @ mentioned in a message. This way, you don?ôt have to see these unwanted conversations unless you want to, and you won?ôt miss a message directed specifically at you.
Ultimately, I?ôm aware that I?ôm whining about a tiny user experience idiosyncrasy ??but it?ôs in an app that I use several times a day, and it?ôs forcing me to constantly confront my relationships with people close to me and as far from my mind as I can imagine. That?ôs more than I bargained for, WhatsApp ??never mind the fact that I?ôm indeed a terrible human being. How about we fix that archive button and put an end to this painful self-reflection, hmm?

There?ôs just a handful of productivity-focused apps you can use right now, the more popular among them being Trello and Asana. I found the Trello add-on useful for quickly adding story ideas and embargoed leads from my inbox into the board I use for planning my publishing schedule; it automatically fills in a card with the subject and body text from the email, so you only need a couple of clicks to use it.

The rest are targeted at salespeople and customer relationship managers; it also looks like certain add-ons, like Quickbooks for invoicing, aren?ôt available everywhere in the world yet (Google mentioned it in its blog post, but the option doesn?ôt show up for me in India).

A feature like this opens the door to all kinds of uses for live Stories: from interviews, to celebrities interacting with each other, spicing things up from a regular live Story ??or even a two-way video call.
For now, the app only allows two users to broadcast a story together, but could eventually develop to integrate multiple accounts. The Stories can be kept for 24 hours, deleted, or even shared on Facebook.
Rounded up: it?ôs a public video call ??and what does that mean for the future of Instagram?
Credit: Instagram
Instagram has gone from simply sharing photos, to messages, to Stories, live Stories and now: shared live Stories. Am I the only one who thinks it?ôll eventually evolve into a video call app, too?
Simply speaking, I could make my Instagram Story private to everyone but my friend who I want to talk to. This way, we could make a shared live Story and have a video call. It?ôs obvious that?ôs not the simplest option at the moment when you have FaceTime or Skype, but eventually could be.
So far, the Facebook-owned application has had no problem straight up copying anything Snapchat has done right ??and video call makes a logical next target. Since launching Stories in August of last year, Instagram?ôs users have soared to 700 million monthly active users globally, proving that as long as they do Snapchat better than Snapchat, they?ôll succeed.
Instagram, unlike Snapchat used mainly by teens, has a wider audience, and could use this as a trial on what could eventually become an integrated video conference app. Collecting stats regarding user demographics from its newest feature, they can decide whether it?ôs worth moving in that direction.
A feature like this could also attract new users, or even motivate those who already have Instagram accounts to give them a better use. It?ôs a lot more tempting to have photos, messages and video calls in one place ??and it also takes up less space on your phone.
By introducing Stories, Instagram showed its users that two apps could be integrated into one. By adding video calls, it can compete with Skype and Instagram could be your go-to app for any kind of messaging.

It?ôs largely a cosmetic overhaul, but one that has important changes for usability. The most obvious change is a new a light theme, meant to better replicate the physical reading experience when browsing your library (don?ôt worry, you can still pick a dark theme). It also uses larger book covers and new fonts to complete the look.

Search is now integrated more heavily into the app ??available from virtually any screen. The idea is that you should be able to both search your library or find new books at any time. My favorite change, however, is that the book you?ôre actively reading now gets its own permanent button on a navigation bar. That means you can always return to the book you?ôre reading from anywhere in the app without having to tap through a myriad of menus.

The other big change is a much larger emphasis on social; the Kindle app now directly integrates reviews and community features from Goodreads, the biggest social network for readers around. You can highlight portions of a book you?ôre reading, for instance, and directly share it to Goodreads. You can check what your friends are reading in a community tab (iOS only to start), chat with them about your analysis, and see suggestions on more people to follow.
The new Kindle app is rolling out to iOS and Android today. Keep in mind it has a new icon that doesn?ôt actually say ?òKindle??on it (it?ôs just the picture of a kid reading under a tree now). Goodreads integration is available on both apps, but the community tab for discovery and discussion is iOS (and US) only to start.

Unfortunately, I can?ôt share that joy with any of my friends in India, because they can?ôt hear a single Google Play Music song until they subscribe to the service.

The bug seems to only affect users in India; when I tried launching a playlist in my US VPN-equipped browser without logging into Google, the tracks played just fine. Even Play store links like this one work as expected ??but that doesn?ôt help matters when you want to share a song, album or playlist from the app.
It isn?ôt clear if this is a technical fault or an issue with Google?ôs music licenses in India: I?ôve been tweeting at the company?ôs concerned Twitter accounts about this since July and haven?ôt received a single response. But it?ôs a big enough problem that there?ôs no way people can trial the service, as well as the best part about a streaming app: sharing tracks.
I?ôm writing this with the selfish premise of getting Google?ôs attention so the company fixes this and lets me do my thing, but it certainly wouldn?ôt hurt Mountain View?ôs business to get more people to use and recommend its streaming music service in a growing market that?ôs expected to grow to 275 million listeners within the next three years.
Besides fumbling on music sharing, Google also doesn?ôt promote its Play Music service in online or traditional advertising in India yet. Meanwhile, rivals like Wynk are using YouTube ads to showcase their extensive libraries; local incumbents like Gaana and Saavn claim to have more than 20 million users apiece on their platforms. Heck, even Apple Music is doing a better job allowing people to hear music on its service than Google?ôs, in the country.
So please, Google, even if you don?ôt care about a single ranting journalist who?ôs itching to share his fire playlists with friends, fix your crappy Play Music bug for a shot at more money; there?ôs going to be $475 million up for grabs by 2020. Thanks for listening.

The company hasn?ôt explained how its app works or whether it uses AI, but it sure is good at applying a range of fine art effects to your pictures.

It?ôs easy as pie to use Portra: just snap a picture or import one from your gallery, choose from 19 filters, and that?ôs it. You can adjust how strong an effect you want, and how much of the frame you?ôd like to retain ??moving the slider causes the edges of your picture to fade and let a canvas show behind it. Oh, and you can also tap the edge of the editing area to see your creation mounted in a frame.
When you?ôre happy with the results, you can save the image to your phone or share it directly to social networks. Annoyingly, Portra adds a wordmark at the bottom of the image, which you might want to crop out. That aside, it?ôs a nice tool for giving your pictures a whole new look; I like using it on photos of city scenes, landscapes and my dog.
While the OG Prisma offers a larger range of filters and even more features, like applying the art style to only the foreground or the background, the results seem artificial in comparison to what Portra manages. For reference, here are the same three images from the header of this article, processed in both Portra (left) and Prisma (right):
Sadly, Portra doesn?ôt generate high-resolution images that you can print; the output looks fine on small screens, but aren?ôt enough to print even on A5-size paper. That?ôs a feature I?ôd happily pay for.

If you want to unlock content from these outlets, you?ôll be able to do so through the links you come across on Facebook, and the transactions will take place on the publications??sites. As such, they?ôll also keep 100 percent of the revenue from these subscriptions.

Facebook noted that it?ôll allow for both premium and freemium models of paywalls for publishers, so they have the option to charge for certain articles only, or to ask you to pay up after you?ôve crossed a certain number of free articles.
With that, Facebook is cementing its position as a media company.

We?ôve rounded up 28 of the best extensions to help you take notes, plan your day, tame your email inbox, research like a pro and stay on top of your workload, all without leaving your browser.
Tip: Although these are designed for use with Chrome, you can actually use them with Opera too.
Let?ôs dive right in, shall we?
Whether you?ôre preparing a report, drafting an article or following a lecture, it?ôs a good idea to keep a note-taking app within easy reach.

As a journalist, I?ôve tried loads of tools for note-taking, but over the past year, I?ôve stuck with Google Keep. It?ôs fast, lightweight and does exactly what I need it to ??add notes quickly with just a click of a button in the browser.
I prefer Keep over alternatives like Evernote and Microsoft OneNote because it?ôs less cluttered and lets me focus on jotting down ideas in a jiffy, rather than offering a bevy of features for formatting text and extensive note organization.
That doesn?ôt mean Keep is a one-trick pony: The extension lets you save pages, images and text from the context menu on any page, and also lets you add notes to them. If you?ôre ready to write up a storm, you can always fire up the full-fledged app, which lets you jot down text, lists and reminders.
I?ôve also grown fond of the Panel view for Keep extension, which opens up the app in a small window that you can work on, even with a separate browser tab open.
??Google Keep

Papier is a dead-simple note-taking tool that wins points for being more readily accessible than any desktop app.
Simply install the extension and open a new tab, and voil√†, instant notepad. It automatically saves your work, allows you some basic formatting and supports keyboard shortcuts. Plus, there?ôs no clutter to distract you: All you see is a blank page ready to accept your notes and grand ideas, in bright white or a more pleasing night mode.
It?ôs a single page notepad that does away with a file storage system, so it feels more like a place to freely scribble thoughts than save and retrieve separate documents. Papier also offers basic rich text formatting that you can enable with keyboard shortcuts and carry over to Web-based text editors.
While it may seem rather light on features, Papier is great at getting out of the way to let you put your ideas on a page, thanks to its nearly invisible interface. That?ôs useful for when you need to brainstorm, quickly jot down a fleeting thought and everything in between ??all without having to look around for a notepad beyond your browser.
??Papier
Got a lot of tasks to accomplish? List them in your browser and you?ôll find it easier to track them through the day.

Jot is at once a simple and beautiful replacement for your new tab page. It displays a lovely new background image every time you open a tab, and lets you list your most important to-dos or short notes for the day in a large, legible font. To retrieve them, all you need to do is launch a fresh tab.
If you don?ôt need all the bells and whistles of advanced task management extensions, Jot is a great choice that looks better than the rest.
??Jot

 
Momentum adds a bunch of useful widgets to your new tab that should help you plan your day easily and reach your immediate goals.
You?ôll find a clock, the local weather, a to-do list and a customizable shortcut menu of links floating above a beautiful background image that changes every so often.
All the elements in the interface can be tweaked to your liking. What?ôs especially neat is the ?òfocus??widget, which sits front and center, and displays your main goal for the day.
$2 a month nets you even more customization options, the ability to sync items from apps like Todoist and Wunderlist, and a rotating ?òfocus??widget that pulls in tasks from your to-do list.
??Momentum

If you haven?ôt yet settled on a default to-do list manager and use Chrome often, Todoist is worth a look. Its extension puts a powerful task list in your browser toolbar and offers a ton of features in a small space.
For starters, you can simply type to add a task or turn the active tab into an item on your list. It also lets you set a priority and enter a due date or recurring date for each to-do. Plus, it displays your schedule spanning the next seven days in a beautiful interface.
The ability to add and scan your to-dos in one place makes it a better choice than Wunderlist, which offers separate extensions for each function. In addition, Todoist pairs with a ton of apps through Zapier to do things like adding your tasks to Google Calendar and creating to-do items from starred messages in Slack.
The only downside to picking Todoist is that certain essential features like tasks reminders and comments require a subscription, which will set you back by $29 a year. Still, it?ôs not a bad deal for an app that syncs across devices and offers plenty more features for its asking price.
??Todoist

If you already use several apps to manage your tasks and projects, Taco?ôs new tab replacement can help you stay on top of them all.
Taco connects to a range of services like Wunderlist, Evernote, Asana, Basecamp and Trello to pull all your projects into your new tab. You can then prioritize them by dragging and dropping items in the ?òUp Next??list, and act on them without having to open each app.
It?ôs powerful enough to filter your tasks by project, yet simple enough to use just like a normal to-do list. I love using Taco because it helps me make progress on both my work projects as well as my daily errands.
??Taco

The web is a vast universe of informative and useful content, and it?ôs easy to get lost in it. Use these tools to make the most of the time you allocate for reading and research.

Reading Time displays a pop-up on every new tab showing how long it?ôd take to read its contents (visible above in the top left hand corner). It?ôs great for deciding whether to pore through a page right away or to save it for later.
The extension is perfect for when you?ôre doing some research online and want to figure out which of several articles you should start with, so you can get quickly get the gist of the topic I?ôm looking up.
Reading Time defaults to the average human reading speed of 228 words per minute, but for accurate results, you?ôll want to take this 1-minute test by Staples and then enter your speed in the extension?ôs options.
??Reading Time

If you?ôve stumbled upon an interesting article, but just don?ôt have the time to read it right away, you can save it for later with Pocket.
Simply click the button on your toolbar or hit Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+S and the page you?ôre browsing will be added to your reading queue, which you can access from Pocket?ôs web app or mobile apps.
When you?ôve got some free time, you can open your list and enjoy all your saved stories in a distraction-free reading interface.
Once you begin filling Pocket with reading material, you?ôll want to install TimeToRead as well: It adds a tag that describes how many minutes each article will take to read.
That helps you pick stuff to read depending on how much free time you have; it also lets you sort stories by how long they?ôll take you to read. As someone who tends to let their Pocket queue grow to an unmanageable size pretty often, it?ôs a handy tool for working through the list a little at a time.
??Pocket

Speed reading is great when you?ôre short on time and need to familiarize yourself with an article. Reedy lets you choose any text on a page, whether it?ôs an entire article or just a paragraph, to speed read in its distraction-free interface.
Information overload is an all-too-real problem these days, and Reedy certainly helps tame it somewhat. When I?ôm bombarded with lengthy emails and press releases, Reedy helps me skim through the facts to determine whether they?ôre worth my time. If you?ôve to pore through a lot of content frequently, this is a great tool to have in your arsenal.
??Reedy

This extension makes it easy to summarize an article by highlighting the best bits. After you?ôve selected the salient portions on a page and shared it with your contacts, they?ôll see only the highlights, along with an indicator of how much reading time you?ôve saved them.
It?ôs not just for sharing, though: I find Highly useful for researching stories that I need to refer to later for my articles and podcast. All my highlights are saved in a searchable list, and there?ôs even an option to link your Pocket and Instapaper accounts and highlight content from your saved posts in those apps.
??Highly

There are tons of tools for bookmarking pages, but it isn?ôt always easy to find them afterwards. That?ôs where Refind comes in.
In addition to saving your bookmarks to the cloud, it also highlights these pages when they appear in your Google search results, making it a lot easier to discover articles and resources you?ôve come across in the past.
??Refind

RSS readers are useful for keeping tabs on blogs you follow, but if you need real-time alerts for when a page is updated, Page Monitor is worth a look.
This extension lets you add any page to a list that it?ôll constantly monitor for changes, and will notify you with a ding to let you know when it spots something.
As a reporter, I use Page Monitor to track tech blogs so I can be quick to pick up news ??but you can also track things like stocks and exchange rates, and product launches and sales. What?ôs especially handy is the extension?ôs export feature, which lets me share all the URLs of sites I follow with my colleagues.
??Page Monitor

Pablo ??from the clever folks who make Buffer ??is a powerful tool for creating images to share on social networks, and it comes in handy when you want to grab your followers??attention in their feeds more effectively than a text-based post could.
The app is great for laying out text, logos and other graphics in correctly-sized images for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest posts. It?ôs easy to align various elements with relation to your canvas, and there?ôs even a massive library of more than 600,000 background images, as well as templates, to help you get started.
The extension lets you grab any image from the Web to begin working on a new creation and also makes it easy to access the tool from anywhere with a single click. It?ôs hard to believe that this is entirely free to use.
??Pablo

There are loads of extensions for taking screenshots, but Nimbus is perhaps the most complete one of them all. In addition to capturing the visible portion of a page, it also lets you select an area, grab the entire page and annotate it with arrows and text before saving the image.
You can also use it to record a screencast, capturing whatever?ôs in your active tab along with your voice. There?ôs even an option to record anything else on your desktop, and the feature works well with multiple monitors to boot. I often use it to highlight visual elements when discussing web design layouts with my colleagues, and to demonstrate apps to my friends and parents.
??Nimbus
It?ôs all too easy to get sidetracked and sucked into a rabbit hole on the web; it happens to me more often than I care to admit. Thankfully, there are some clever tools that can help you maintain your focus and stick to your tasks. Here are our favorites.

The Pomodoro technique is a simple time management method that encourages you to get the most out of your time, and this extension makes it a cinch to implement it in your own workflow.
When you?ôre ready to hunker down, fire up a new tab and choose from a list of sites that you want (or skip this step entirely). Next, list some tasks that you need to complete and hit the ?òstart??button in that tab. Focus will then start a 25-minute timer, during which it?ôll block your selected sites and remind you to get back to work.
It?ôs flexible enough to act as a no-frills timer, if that?ôs how you prefer to work ??but it also lets you block time-wasting sites if you?ôre not as weak-willed as I am. The combination of an ephemeral task list, a simple timer and a beautiful interface make Focus an effective productivity tool you?ôll want to use often.
??Focus

There?ôs usually no good reason to visit Facebook and Twitter five times an hour, but I?ôm guilty of that more often than I?ôd like to admit. That?ôs why I?ôm glad I discovered Stayfocusd.
This powerful extension lets you set a time limit for sites that you visit while procrastinating. When your time?ôs up, it displays a reminder to get back to work and prevents you from visiting that page until the specified daily reset time.
Stayfocusd offers several settings to keep you from time-wasters, including lists of blocked and allowed sites, a tricky challenge to keep you from adjusting your reset time and even a Nuclear option that will block all sites for as many hours as you specify. Use it with caution!
??StayFocusd

Forest presents a unique take on staying focused. It combines a Pomodoro timer with gamification and a site blocker.
Fire up the extension from the toolbar and you?ôll have 25 minutes to work on your task; during this time, a virtual tree is planted, and its life depends on you staying away from blacklisted sites like Reddit and Facebook.
Stick to your work and your plant will bloom into a beautiful tree; break your focus and it?ôll wilt and die. If you grab the mobile app (available for Android, iOS and Windows Phone) and pony up $1, you can sync your focus sessions to it and see your trees populate a virtual forest.
It?ôs a novel approach to helping you be more productive, and strangely enough, it works! You can even track all the trees you?ôve grown in your forest, in the accompanying mobile app. If the standard Pomodoro timer doesn?ôt do it for you, this is certainly worth a try.
??Forest

Depending on your work style, you might enjoy a little background noise to help you stay focused on the task at hand. Noisli offers a range of ambient sounds, like rain, forests, the drone of a fan and even a coffee shop to listen to while you work.
You?ôll need to sign up for an account to use the extension, but it?ôs free and only takes a second. Once you?ôre registered, you can create and save combinations of sounds to suit your preferences. Plus, there?ôs a timer to help you stick to your schedule, or use the Pomodoro technique to complete tasks in short order.
Noisli isn?ôt the first app of its kind, but it is one of the most customizable ones out there, and its extension saves you the hassle of keeping an extra tab open for alternatives like Coffivity.
??Noisli

If you often feel like you?ôre not getting much work done and wonder where the times goes at the end of each day, the answer might be in your browsing history.
A visual representation of how much time you spend procrastinating can be a powerful motivator to get you to be more productive. It can also tell you when in the day you get more work done, so you can figure out how to optimize the time spent at your desk.
RescueTime does just that. It keeps an eye on your activity in Chrome and generates charts to show which sites you spend most of your time on. You can have it break down your activity by day or month, and see which days you were busiest.
Of course, you don?ôt need to be a statistician to understand its findings. RescueTime?ôs simple, color-coded charts are easy to read and help you get to grips with your browsing habits with just a glance.
The free version packs enough features to monitor your productivity; $72 per year nets you the premium plan, which includes additional functionality like a site blocker, alerts to let you know when you?ôve worked for a certain number of hours and even more in-depth reports.
If you?ôre looking for something a bit more spartan for your monitoring needs, be sure to try out TimeStats.
??RescueTime

This is a deceptively simple lifehack rolled up into an extension. Voice Clock does exactly what its name implies: It announces the time every hour or half hour. Whether you?ôre working on one major task or a bunch of small ones, this audio alert serves to make you aware of how much you?ôve got done through the day and subtly pushes you to be more productive.
It may not sound like much, but it?ôs actually quite effective, and becomes even more so as you get used to it. What?ôs nice about this extension is that you can customize it to say whatever you like at various times, like announce your lunch break with ?òIt?ôs Nom o?ôclock??or when you can clock out for the day.
??Voice Clock
Open up too many tabs and you?ôll not only find yourself overwhelmed and unable to focus on the task at hand, but you?ôll also slow your desktop to a crawl. Try these tools to wrangle them.

Chrome can be quite the memory hog when you have a ton of tabs open, like I usually do. Thankfully, there?ôs a way to free up RAM without drastically changing your browsing habits.
This extension suspends tabs that you haven?ôt interacted with in an hour so they don?ôt take up valuable memory; you can always reload them with just a click when you need them.
??The Great Suspender

Tab Snooze tackles the problem of too many open tabs by making them disappear until you need them again ??whether it?ôs later that evening, the next day or even later.
You can tweak the settings to adjust when these tabs will resurface, and access your snoozed pages at any time in a list. As someone who gets distracted way too easily with ?òmust-see??links on Twitter and Reddit, this is a must-have to keep my tasks on track.
??Tab Snooze

Although OneTab is designed to reduce Chrome?ôs memory use, it actually does a whole lot more to help you manage your browsing session effectively.
Its primary function is to consolidate all the open tabs in a window into a single list of links, closing each tab as it goes and freeing up precious RAM. You can then restore these pages one by one or all at once.
If you?ôve gathered up a bunch of interesting pages in your session, you can turn your list of tabs into a web page that you can share with anyone. If you prefer, you can export them as plain-text URLs.
That?ôs not all: OneTab also lets you name groups of tabs and add pages to them individually from the right-click context menu ??making it a breeze to bring all your online research together and organize it as you please. If you?ôre like me and often bring your desktop to its knees with too many open tabs, you?ôll want to give OneTab a try.
??OneTab

We?ôve all hit ?òSend??prematurely at some point in our lives and wished we could bring back that erroneous email. Gmail lets you do that with a short window, but Criptext uses advanced tech to allow you to change your message at any time ??and even wipe it entirely.
The way it works is that Criptext converts your email contents into an image only when it?ôs opened; that way, the text you typed remains within your control after you?ôve hit send and until your recipient views your message for the first time.
Plus, Criptext?ôs cloud-based system keeps your correspondence secure, supports attachments up to 100MB in size and lets you set your messages to self-destruct after a specific amount of time.
??Criptext

Slik was developed by a 15-year-old (yup, you read that right) to help marketers discover leads more easily around the web.
Found a prospective client? Just look them up on LinkedIn, click the Slik button and it?ôll instantly hunt down their official email address for you.
Co-founder Soroush Ghodsi says that Slik is about 95 percent accurate, thanks to a unique combination of web scraping, pattern matching and the use of third-party APIs to find addresses ??and it lives up to the hype.
This is the only extension on our list that?ôll cost you. Slik will hunt down your first 10 email addresses for free, but after that, you?ôll need to subscribe to one of its paid plans, which start at $30 per month for 300 verified emails.
??Slik

This extension supercharges your Gmail inbox by displaying details of everyone who writes to you, including links to their social profiles.
That makes it a snap to add them to your contact list, edit information like tags and notes, and even schedule calendar events right from the sidebar next to their email message.
As a journalist in the tech industry, I find Clearbit Connect especially helpful in dealing with the long list of developers, entrepreneurs and PR professionals that I?ôm fortunate to work with on a regular basis: Tracking my history interacting with them on numerous stories helps me build better relationships with them.
Clearbit Connect also has another useful trick up its sleeve: It lets you search for just about any professional?ôs email address, right from your inbox. If you know their name and their company?ôs name, chances are that the extension will be able to track down the right address ??and add it to a new Compose window with just a click.
??Clearbit Connect

Staying on top of all the email I receive across three Gmail inboxes is no mean feat, and I?ôm usually not up to the task. Checker Plus lightens the load a bit by allowing me to scroll through all my messages right from my browser toolbar, along with the ability to reply, delete and archive them.
You can choose to receive audible notifications, set the toolbar button to open your inbox and use keyboard shortcuts to quickly triage your overflowing email ??all without having to leave whatever else you?ôre working on. Oh, and you can choose a custom theme to personalize it too. Pretty soon, you may stop visiting your inbox altogether.
??Checker Plus
That brings us to the end of our roundup of powerful Chrome extensions to boost your productivity. Once you?ôve tried a few and found your favorites, you?ôll wonder how you ever managed without them, and probably uninstall a few redundant desktop apps too. Let us know about your favorite extensions in the comments.

444,apps,"Nielsen, the company which has been monitoring television show views and providing ratings for over ninety years, today announced it was creating a new service casting light on ?úSubscription-based Streaming Content Consumption????in other words, Netflix, Hulu, and the like.
Nielsen says it?ôs providing a service for a number of studios who have no idea what kind of streaming numbers Netflix has. As Megan Clarksen, president of Watch at Nielsen, said:
The significant growth of SVOD services in entertainment markets across the world has created demand from rights owners to understand the size and composition of audiences relative to other programs and platforms. The syndication of SVOD measurement as part of Nielsen?ôs Total Audience offerings represents a big step forward in terms of moving closer to transparency within the SVOD marketplace.
One way the company is going to track ratings is via Nielsen meters ??specifically, via audio recognition software. According to the New York Times, the company listens via its set meters, devices connected to TVs in several thousand homes across the country. The meters record data and send it back to Nielsen nightly. So if you watch Netflix on your TV and you have a Nielsen device in your home, the company will listen and note it.
That?ôs more than a little creepy, not to mention an ineffective way of monitoring Netflix. Nielsen might be able to measure who?ôs streaming stuff on their set top box, but it has no way of measuring Netflix views on devices, such as laptops or tablets ??which is the only way I watch Netflix these days. Not to mention that Nielsen only has meters in a small number of houses, compared with Netflix?ôs 104 million subscribers.
It might be for that reason Netflix is so dismissive of Nielsen?ôs attempts. As one spokesperson told Variety, ?úThe data that Nielsen is reporting is not accurate, not even close, and does not reflect the viewing of these shows on Netflix.??
Nielsen has never been able to gain a foothold on a Netflix audience, and this isn?ôt the first time the company has attempted to ally with newer media to study modern viewing habits. Last year, it announced it was partnering with Facebook and Twitter to track mentions and shares of shows on the social media sites, using the data to provide ?úSocial Content Ratings.??
According to the Times and other sources, Nielsen is not releasing the numbers to the public or press, so apparently the company is taking a leaf from Netflix?ôs book by veiling its numbers in mystery.
Netflix will occasionally release its own material on ratings and views, but always on its own terms. For example, yesterday the company put out a list of the most ?úbinge-raced??series ??meaning watched an entire season within 24 hours of its release. According to Netflix, 8.4 million of their subscribers binge race.
But other than these small offerings, Netflix doesn?ôt really release numbers very often. That might be why eight networks and studios have, according to Nielsen, turned to an older, well-tested method of measuring viewership.
We?ôve contacted Netflix for further comment.

445,apps,"HQ Trivia, a new app from the creators of Vine, is recreating the appeal of game shows for iPhone users.
The app debuted a few months ago, but has been gaining in popularity since then. The show goes live at 3pm and 9pm ET on weekdays. Host Scott Rogowsky asks a series of trivia questions, and players choose their answer, while chatting live. Players who get answers right can win cash prizes, and collect via PayPal.
Apparently you have to start the app on time to be able to see the show ??no showing up late. This might be the one thing that puts it at a disadvantage over TV. When you?ôre late to a TV show, you can still get the gist of it. Still, if the reaction of players online is anything to go by, it?ôs got an addictive appeal.

It?ôs no coincidence the app resembles a traditional game show in some ways. Rus Yusupov, formerly of Vine and one of HQ?ôs creators, told TechCrunch, ?úWe all grew up watching Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune. That?ôs our basis for this kind of stuff.??
The thrill of TV game shows is 1) they?ôre only on at a certain time, and 2) they allow just about anyone to compete for a prize. HQ is one of the first apps to successfully bring that appeal to phones, and I can see several other apps copying this in future. Maybe we can bring back the fun of old shows like Password or Hollywood Squares in app form.
HQ Trivia is currently available only on iOS.

446,apps,"I spend a lot of time in my inbox. Dealing with the hundreds of pitches, follow-ups, and angry emails I get each day is basically a full-time job. I really wish that wasn?ôt the case though, but until someone builds an app that deports tech publicists to a land where there?ôs no Internet, and the words ?úhope you?ôre well??are punishable by death, it?ôs my cross to bear.
Or then again, maybe not. Enter Boomerang. We covered this email tool way back in 2010. Its schtick was you could control when you send and receive email. I kinda love that idea; work-life balance is important, but smartphones have pretty much entirely undermined that idea.
Now, it?ôs introduced an AI assistant, which uses machine learning and NLP (natural language processing) tech to do much of the heavy sifting for you. Put simply, it reads your email for you, and tells you what it thinks you?ôll care about, leaving the irrelevant chaff and garbage marketing emails to one side.
Boomerang now has a little microphone icon. When you tap that and say ?úbrief me,??the app takes you to a briefing page, which contains highlights from your inbox, along with some analytics. It?ôll show you, for example, how long it?ôd take you to clear your inbox, if you made a concerted decision to sit down and play catch-up.

Scroll down, and you?ôll see relevant highlights. I was actually really impressed with what Boomerang thought I?ôd be interested in. It was all pretty spot-on, although that?ôs largely because it?ôs based on my personal usage patterns, like the emails I choose to open, and the ones I ultimately reply to.
Boomerang also highlights relevant passages from emails. I was really impressed with how this worked. On one email inviting me to an event in London, the passage selected contained the all the pertinent details of the event (like the name, address, and time). It pretty much skipped the ?úHi, how are you, long time no speak??part.
That said, the accuracy of the voice recognition itself isn?ôt perfect. I tried asking Boomerang for our Editor-in-Chief, Alejandro Tauber?ôs, phone number. It thought I wanted ?úAli Hondro?ôs??number. Perhaps it?ôs just my Northern English accent, but I don?ôt recall having a similar issue with Siri or Google Now.
Anyway, Ali Hondro is a much better name, and I plan to continue using it until my employment is eventually terminated with cause.
Another caveat: At the moment, Boomerang?ôs voice-driven AI can be pretty slow, especially if you?ôre trying to do a big query. That?ôs to be expected though, especially if your inbox consists of thousands of items, and grows faster than the Elephant Man?ôs face.
Briefings are, in my opinion, the coolest part of the new Boomerang app. But the assistant does so much more. It actually lets you verbally identify things in your email just by asking (?úFind me Barry White?ôs phone number??or ?úFind me the PDF from Susie??. That alone is pretty cool, because who hasn?ôt spent hours delving through an inbox looking for a flight itinerary, or some concert tickets, or something. Sexy.

You can also reschedule meetings and calendar events, perform mass-deletes, and sort-and-filter through the mess, just by speaking to your phone. Essentially, it?ôs a context-aware version of Siri.
Boomerang markets itself as a productivity tool for high-powered go-getters. And that?ôs almost probably true. But it?ôs also pretty handy for those of us who are innundated with emails, and want to spend less time keeping on top of their inboxes. It?ôs an email client for people who hate email, essentially.
This is just baked into the app. Arguably Boomerang?ôs best feature is the ability to perform actions on an individual email, simply by swiping right-to-left, and selecting an option. It?ôs all very fluid and beautiful, and it works so well. Boomerang prioritizes expediency above all else.

Boomerang?ôs new AI assistant is available from today. You can download the app for iOS here.

447,apps,"WhatsApp today announced that users would be able to share their location live in the app. Your friends and family will be able to follow your movements for as long as you want.
The feature is very similar to Facebook?ôs Live Location sharing, though you?ôll be able to share your location for slightly longer in WhatsApp (at least 8 hours).
To share your location, choose ?úLocation??under the attachment options. After the app update, you?ôll see a new option called ?úShare Live Location.??Then you select how long you want to share your location ??15 minutes, an hour, etc. Once you do, a map will appear in chat with your location on it, with your location being broadcast in real time. You can stop the feature any time.
This sounds useful for guiding friends to a particular location: if they share their location with you, you can give them directions. You can also use it to make your flaky friends prove they?ôre actually ?úOMW.??It could also be used for safety purposes, such as in disaster situations.
Also, if you?ôre in a chat where more than one person shares their location, you?ôll all appear on the same map ??meaning you could use this feature to coordinate meetups or trips.
Live Location will be rolling out to Android and iOS users in the coming weeks.

448,apps,"Snap and NBCUniversal have teamed up to create a Hollywood studio set to focus on mobile entertainment.
The joint venture aims to bring longer, scripted content to the app world. The project will focus on teaming up with creative partners in order to create 8-10 minute shows in the hopes of keeping (or increasing) its 173 million active daily users on the app. The deals will be exclusive, unlike Facebook and YouTube ??only partners will be produce content, leaving out any competition.
Earlier this year, Snapchat teamed up with over a dozen companies to create original content for its discover section. The app already offers short-format shows, such as Good Luck America, a news show hosted by Peter Hamby during the elections, and NBC?ôs The Voice, which was even nominated for an Emmy. This deal included big names such as ABC, BBC and of course, NBCUniversal, which makes sense, as it invested $500 million in Snap at the beginning of the year.
Mark and Jay Duplass, co-creators of HBO series ?úRoom 104??and ?úTogetherness,??landed the first deal of the newest project. Mark told Business Insider that they are keen to see how millennials, their main audience, react to this kind of content. The biggest challenge will be working with vertical-frame format, which is one of the main differences from their usual work, but said the companies gave them creative freedom over the content.
The whole deal seems attractive, but there?ôs a reason a lot of users have abandoned Snapchat. Instagram has managed to snatch users over to its app by offering the basic Snapchat idea: sharing images and stories that people see for a limited time. Any added features, such as discover, only keep users in once they?ôre already using the app ??and I?ôm not entirely sure it will bring back in those who have stopped using it, or never used it at all.
I stopped using Snapchat a few months after Instagram introduced stories ??it felt like betrayal at first, but once you get the hang of having everything in one application, there?ôs virtually no sense in having both Snapchat and Instagram installed on your phone. If Snapchat couldn?ôt keep me in with its exclusive discover features or admittedly better effects, I?ôm pretty sure I won?ôt be back once they have 10 minute shows.
Snapchat?ôs latest attempt to keep its head above water can be compared to Facebook?ôs Watch, the company?ôs newest feature, to differentiate themselves from other platforms and provide original, exclusive content, just like YouTube. The only way these projects will be successful is if they give the audience something they can?ôt find elsewhere.
Snap and NBCU must ensure that the content that they produce jointly will be of high enough quality to attract new users. If that fails, there will be no difference between the current discover section, mini-shows and what?ôs to come.

449,apps,"In a move to counteract the spread of browser malware, yesterday Google announced its plans to ramp up its security mechanisms in Chrome to make it easier for users to prevent and recover from unwanted software infections.
But good intentions aside, there is one aspect of this implementation that creeps me out: the same measures put in place to protect us are also enabling Google to scan precisely what extensions we download to our browsers and how we use them.
The push towards increased antivirus defenses comes only a week after reports broke out that a malicious adblock extension on the Chrome Store had been downloaded well over 37,000 times. The more pressing issue, though, was that there were hundreds of other infectious instances of the same app still in the wild.
This is precisely what the new security additions were designed to negate. But this is not to say that these measures come without any caveats.
The first new feature makes it more difficult for extensions to make changes to your browser settings. To thwart such apps from tampering with your Chrome setup, the browser will now actively seek to detect when extensions have made changes without your consent and offer to revert all alterations with one click.

The second security addition builds on the already-existent Chrome Cleanup feature, which makes it easier to remove bundled software that third-party extensions have installed to your system without your knowledge.
The redesigned Cleanup functionality makes this process simpler and quicker.

This leads us to the last and most troubling security feature ??namely, the upgraded Cleanup engine.
Google collaborated with security firm ESET (whose Mac antivirus software was recently discovered to be susceptible to attacks) to upgrade Chrome?ôs sandbox technology with ESET?ôs detection algorithm which was designed to scour for violations and remove offending software.
As some users have pointed out, the upgraded Cleanup engine essentially works like Microsoft?ôs anti-malware SmartScreen filters in Windows 10. Unlike Microsoft though, it remains unclear whether Google will give Chrome users to opt out from this setting.
But here is the main issue: in order to perform this detection analysis properly, Chrome will be scanning through every piece of software you have downloaded and actively recording this data.
So why should we be worried about all this data Google collects? In a recent talk at Amsterdam-based tech hub TQ (disclaimer: TNW founded TQ), Alphabet executive chairman and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt was vocal the search engine heavyweight is comfortable to make most of its money from advertising.
?úWe are in the advertising business and we love advertising,??Shmidt said.
But while the Big G is happy to keep stacking capital from its ad streams, we ought to maintain a healthy dose of skepticism when we consider what implications this business model has for us, the users.
You know what they say: ?úIf you?ôre not the customer, you?ôre the product.??
Whether or not it bothers you on a personal level, Google makes its money from studying our desires and attending to them more effectively ??or empowering other companies to do so.
Yes, Google still cares about improving its line of services, but there is an added incentive to monitoring and analyzing how we use these products: what we do, how we do it, why we like doing it and what keeps us coming back for more is the fuel the Mountain View company needs to keep growing ??and its aggressive scaling approach necessitates large quantities of that.
In a way, this is also what the new security features bring to Chrome: better functionality for the users and more gleanable insights for the maker.
Of course, Google wants to direct your attention exclusively towards what benefits you ??not them. After all, its success depends on your docile acceptance that functionality matters more to you than privacy.

As the stories rolled in from other women who?ôve been victimized by Weinstein, others also spoke up about their own experiences with sexual assault and harassment ??men and women alike. Now those stories are accumulating under the hashtag #MeToo, which is spreading on social media like wildfire.
The hashtag started when Alyssa Milano, former costar of firebrand Rose McGowan, tweeted that women who?ôve been through similar experiences should reply with ?úMe too:??

To me, the hashtag is significant because it?ôs not inherently a gendered one.

It?ôs an important reminder that it?ôs not just young actresses who can be taken advantage of by those with high personal connections and no scruples.
The hashtag is still going strong across Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, and shows no signs of slowing down.

451,apps,"Taking a cue from Facebook, earlier this year LinkedIn redesigned its website to make it a bit less confusing and a tad more suitable for social interactions. But it seems Facebook too is paying attention to LinkedIn.
The social media giant is currently testing a new Resume / CV feature that lets users share their work experience with their friends. The new addition expands on the standard ?òWork and education??section, but won?ôt publicly display all information about your credentials.
The dedicated resume field lets you conveniently list your professional and educational background in more detail. It also allows selecting the precise dates when you started and left each undertaking that appears there.
Here is what it looks like:
Much like on LinkedIn, users who have multiple past work experiences can indicate their present place of employment by selecting the ?òI currently work here??option.
Interestingly, the screenshots indicate the detailed information will not readily show up on your public profile. This could mean that Facebook is considering making the hidden resume details available exclusively to job hunters and talent seekers.
The functionality appears to be available exclusively to a limited group of users for now though ??which means not everyone can see it yet. Amsterdam-based TNW staffers were unable to access the revamped Resume page, but it appears to be available to some users in the US, according to tips.
As with any other test feat, there is no telling whether and when the functionality will make its way to all users.
We have contacted Facebook for a clarification and will update this post accordingly should we hear back.
Update: A spokesperson for Facebook has since contacted TNW with the following statement:

To order food, visit the page of a participating restaurant and hit the ?úStart Order??button. You?ôll be directed to choose an ordering service and a time, and from there you select a food order from the menu.
This feature has been in testing for a few months now ??we first noticed it in May, when it was rolled out to some users. Now, it?ôs coming out to everyone, with more food delivery partnernships. In May, it was Slice and Delivery.com doing the heavy lifting, but now the company has also partnered with GrubHub, ChowNow, EatStreet, (wow, how many of these rhyme?) DoorDash, Zuppler, and Olo.
Users can also order directly from certain restaurants, including Chipotle, Five Guys, Jimmy John?ôs, and Jack in the Box. To find a restaurant, open the ?úOrder Food??section (with the knife and fork icon) and look for restaurants with delivery and pickup options.
According to Alex Himmel, Facebook?ôs VP of Local:
People already go to Facebook to browse restaurants and decide where to eat or where to order food, so we?ôre making that easier. We?ôre combining options from a number of restaurants and food ordering services, so you don?ôt have to search through multiple places and eat what you want, in just a few taps.
Notably,  you will need accounts with certain food delivery services before you?ôll be able to use them ??Himmel uses Delivery.com as an example. This cuts down on the convenience somewhat, but at least Facebook will let you handle that within the app.
The update rolls out today for US users on Android, iOS, and desktop. I look forward to never again having to leave my house.

454,apps,"A new report today confirmed that Airbnb is investing in the real estate market ??specifically, an upscale apartment complex in Kissimmee, Florida, set to open sometime next year.
Newgard Development Group will oversee the construction of the building, which will be called ?úNiido by Airbnb??(apparently a play on the Spanish word for ?únest??. The building will have 300 units in total. It sounds fairly plush (if not a little hotel-like), featuring keyless entry, concierge services, and long-term storage.
The amenities are all designed to encourage use by Airbnb customers. Tenants will be able to rent their unit out for up to 180 nights a year via a special version of the Airbnb app. Jaja Jackson, global partnerships director at Airbnb, told Bloomberg:
We?ôre trying to make sure that home-sharing is not done in the shadows. This partnership shows how landlords, developers and Airbnb can work together.
Airbnb has faced criticism for years over the way it turns residential housing areas into ad hoc hotels. An Airbnb-specific housing development in one of the most popular vacation destinations in the country would allow it to skirt those complaints by virtue of being designed to be profitable for both the business and the landlord.
One wonders what effect this will have on Kissimmee?ôs other Airbnb hosts. According to the Orlando Sentinel, Kissimmee, which is about ten miles away from Walt Disney World, is the third most Airbnb-ed city in the state, after Miami Beach and Miami.
Also, it?ôs not clear how much Airbnb gains from the building, and whether it keeps a portion of the revenue from both long- and short-term tenants. We?ôve contacted Airbnb for more information.
This seems like it could expand the Airbnb market, but it also feels like an odd turn for the company built to help ordinary citizens rent their homes. Airbnb having its own properties with amenities an ordinary home can?ôt offer might take the focus away from less glamorous locations that are nevertheless a vital source of income for the owner.

456,apps,"If you get a message from a Facebook Friend telling you they urgently need your help accessing their account ??pause, because someone?ôs trying to use Facebook security against you.
Access Now yesterday revealed details of the phishing scam that has apparently claimed a few victims recently. It?ôs basically an attempt to con you into handing over your account codes to someone you think you can trust.
The attack is initiated by someone who has already taken over the account of a friend. They send you an urgent message claiming to need help getting back into their account, and to check your email for a recovery code. At this point, they try to log into your account using the ?úForgot my password??button. The idea is that, when you check your email and see the recovery code from Facebook your scammer triggered, you?ôll send that code and thereby give them access to your account.
This capitalizes on a security feature from 2013 you might not know about. Facebook has a feature called ?úTrusted Contacts,??which allows you to choose 3-5 friends who you trust to help you recover your account in the event you get locked out. The scammer claims you are one of their contacts, and a cursory search on your part will tell you the feature is a real thing even if you?ôve never heard of it. It?ôd be easy to get sucked in.

One easy way of avoiding this scam is to contact the person whose account is messaging you ??via phone call, ideally, in case their other accounts have also been taken over. If they don?ôt know what you?ôre talking about, then that?ôd be a clue. Also, it helps to know exactly which Friends have you as their Trusted Contacts, so you?ôre not taken by surprise.
Another giveaway is the information they request. When you get locked out of your account, your Trusted Contacts don?ôt just send you a recovery code ??they each send a part of a recovery code. You need a part from all of your Trusted Contacts in order to get back into your account. So it won?ôt look the same as the recovery codes you would use on your own account.

According to a Socratic spokesperson, the intent of the new features is to mimic the communicative aspects of social media without the distractions and white noise:
It sounds peculiar, but teens turn to their social circles for help all the time ??often on apps riddled with distractions (Facebook, Snapchat, etc). On Socratic, they can now message friends directly for help and tackle their toughest questions with classmates, zero distractions.
Social media is a key part of many students??experience, if the number of Facebook Groups listed under ?úSchool and Education??is anything to go by. I used it myself when I was in college. But whenever I studied with friends in my Facebook groups in college, it was incredibly easy to get distracted by everything else that Facebook offers.
While I could see this as being potentially abused by students who just want to chat with their classmates, I also think it?ôs helped by the fact that Socratic is already an education-only app. If nothing else, it might help students who are otherwise easily distracted by the shiny lure of social media stay on target.

You can also book a table, get a ride there, and see what other people have Snapped from the same location.

In fact, the company has already promised a fix on at least several occasions: While it initially acknowledged the flaw in April, it again reassured us it is working on a solution in May, August, September and October.
Sorry, this is a known bug of ours. ?òî We hope to have you dragging and dropping files again as soon as possible!

Sorry, we don?ôt have any news to report on that yet.

So sorry this is persisting. Can you please drop us a note so we can check a few things? https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X ?ôè

Sorry ??we know this bug is frustrating, but it?ôs proving difficult to pinpoint. Please bear with us while we get to the bottom of it! ?êõ

We?ôre so sorry! We?ôre doing all we can to squash this bug ??thanks for bearing with us ?êõ

This much-needed solution has yet to make it to the official app though ??and there is still no clear timeline when the promised update will roll out.
Yes, bugs are nothing unusual in the world of software engineering. But it is straight-up unprofessional when a company boasting more than six million daily active users is taking over six months to eliminate a well-known technical issue ??especially when a bug is proving to be as big of a frustration to users as this one.
Here is the kicker though: This is literally the worst time for Slack to be pissing off its users, to say the least.
The titans of the industry are already patiently scheming to take the team communication market over ??and this could spell trouble for Slack big time.
The list of companies that have released a ?úSlack competitor??over the past year so far includes Microsoft and its Teams app, Google and its revamped Hangouts, Facebook and its Workspace, and last but not least, Atlassian and its Hipchat-powered Stride platform.
The truth is that the bench is getting deeper by the day: Slack starts up along with my MacBook today, but it could easily take a backseat to any of the still up-and-coming alternatives tomorrow.
At the end of the day, software is as good as it does its job, and Slack is as replaceable as the next big thing to hit the team communication market.

465,apps,"Developers sure have a penchant for ranting and spitting wisecracks at the most unusual places. So much so that one bored Microsoft programmer has built a Twitter bot that tweets anytime a developer swears publicly on GitHub.
Yes, that is apparently a thing. Built by MS Azure software engineer Will Pearson, Gitlost is a hilarious bot that scavenges the GitHub API for commits containing profanity and then goes on to surface them on Twitter for everybody else to read.
In fact, it is pretty damn funny. Here are some the best entries as of recently:

One thing to keep in mind is that Pearson refrained from programming Gitlost to add links to the commits where the profanities in question appeared. The reason was to prevent opportunistic devs from using the bot for publicity stunts.
This is what he had to say about this:
I made a decision not to save that information so that people don't try to get on gitlost intentionally for publicity reasons.
??will (@uiri00) October 9, 2017

Since first launching back in 2013, the bot has retweeted more than 40,000 obscenity-ridden commit messages. In all fairness, some of these were not strictly profanities, but rather contained strings which could be interpreted as such ??something more commonly known as the Scunthorpe Problem.
You know, tweets like these:

466,apps,"So you just downloaded Snapchat. Now what?
The photo app that everyone wants to copy and yet no one can manage to fully destroy is still a little obscure for those who didn?ôt get onboard during its initial rush of popularity.
I?ôve actually been asked by multiple people who know my profession to ?úexplain Snapchat??to them. That?ôs not something that can be done in a short conversation, so here we are.
Here?ôs a complete guide to Snapchat, including what it does, how to use it, and a bunch of other details you didn?ôt think you needed to know.
Also, full disclosure: I?ôve only ever used Snapchat on an iPhone. I?ôm given to understand that the essential experience between Android and iOS versions of the app are the same, but let me know if I?ôve got anything in particular wrong.
Let?ôs start by getting you familiar with the Snapchat lingo. Here are the most basic terms you need to know when you?ôre using (or talking about) Snapchat:
Now that you know what you?ôre going to be looking at, it?ôs time to take a look. The app loads in camera mode, ready to go when you need to capture a Snap. The actual camera functions the same as any other photo app, but for now let?ôs look at the other things on display.

For starters, at the top left of the screen is a ghost icon ??that?ôs Snapchat?ôs mascot, Ghostface Chillah. Tapping on him will take you to the app menu.

In the menu, you can see who?ôs added you, access the contact menu so you can add people yourself, and see all of your essential Snapchat info, such as your Snapcode. The gear icon on the top right gives you access to all the basic stuff like password, login credentials, and some of the app?ôs secondary functions, which we?ôll get to later.
Now we?ôll go over the functions, screen by screen.
The primary screen, which is open when you pull up the app, is the camera screen. This is where you take Snaps, embellish them, and send them into the wild.
Snaps are the lifeblood of Snapchat. 90% of the app?ôs functions revolve around helping the user send the perfect Snap.
When you?ôre taking a Snap, you use your phone?ôs camera the way you ordinarily would to frame the image. The buttons at the top right let you (from left to right) engage Low Light mode (for taking pics when the lighting isn?ôt so good), toggle Flash, and flip between front- and back-facing cameras.

When you want to add a Lens, you hold your finger down on the screen over the area you want to enhance. Most Lenses are focused on the face, so when you tap on your face, it maps the surface and shows you a series of different Lenses you can apply.

Some Lenses are timely, while others stick around forever. Here?ôs me with a Major Lazer Lens that will probably be gone from the app by the time the article is published (it?ôs part of a promotion):

When you?ôve taken the picture, that?ôs when you can really start to make adjustments.
After you?ôre finished taking the picture, or filming the short video, a host of new buttons pop up on the sides of the screen. Let?ôs go over what they do.
From the top: The T in the top right is how you add text to an image. You can write just about anything, and choose the color of the text.

You can tap the T to adjust the size of the text.
The pencil-looking button will let you draw on the image in the color of your choice, which you do with the tip of your finger or a stylus. Here, I?ôve completed the fall pumpkin filter by giving myself a lovely stem.

 
Next, the little button that looks like a piece of paper with the corner turned up is the sticker button. There are so many stickers in the menu that I don?ôt dare show you all of them for fear the amount of images would crash every computer in the vicinity. Here?ôs a look at some seasonal stickers:

Once you select one, you merely place it anywhere in the image.

Next is the scissors tool, which acts as an eraser and a make-your-own sticker tool. See instructions here on how to make your own stickers. The scissors can be used to erase things from images, and to create custom overlays by allowing you to erase parts of a filter to let certain parts of the image show through. To use it, hold your finger down and outline the image you want to cut out, or isolate.

The paperclip button allows you to put a URL on the page. To use it, type the URL into the search tool and attach it to your Snap.

Finally, the stopwatch button lets you set how long someone can view the Snap. You can set the timer from 1-10 seconds, or set it to loop infinitely.

Filters are the other major change you can make from this editing screen. To use a Filter, swipe right or left from the editing screen. Filters can range from black-and-white color washes to location-specific icons to temperature and speed read-outs (excuse the cutesie selfie pose here):

Just to reiterate, the difference between a Lens and a Filter is that a Lens can move with you, while a Filter is static and applied after the image is captured.
Once you?ôre done creating your Snap, you can send it. Hit the blue arrow at the bottom right of the screen, and your contact list will come up showing who you can send the image to. You?ôll also have options for ?úMy Story,??which is your public Snap reel, and ?úOur Story,??a collection of Snaps curated from users in a specific area or attending the same event.

Once you?ôve selected who you want to receive the Snap, you hit the blue arrow again, and you?ôve sent your Snap.
Also, if you want to see what the ?úOur Story??gets you, you can pinch the main screen to see the Snap Map, which shows you Snaps from everyone in a certain area ??which is where the curated Snaps go. Clicking on one will let you see all the Snaps from the people in that area who have submitted Snaps to ?úOur Story.??

That?ôs all for the main screen. Now for the auxiliary functions.
Swiping down from the main screen opens the search function. This is just what it sounds like ??you can search for your friends, their stories, popular users to follow, hashtags, and other things. It?ôs a goldmine of information for those just starting out.

Swiping left on your main screen takes you to your contact list, along with the Chat screen.
In addition to Snaps, you can also send text messages, short video clips, and stickers directly to your contacts. All you have to do is tap their name in the list, and you can correspond with them directly. Keep in mind that any messages you exchange will disappear once read, just like Snaps.

Swiping left from this screen will bring up their contact page. From here, you can see their details, and block or remove them as necessary.

Swiping right from the main screen takes you to everyone else?ôs content. Namely, you can see your friend?ôs stories, watch the short shows that Snapchat has produced, and find other content creators to follow. It?ôs fun to explore, as there are a number of great creations to be found in this section, and I recommend giving it a look yourself, lest I spoil the experience for you.

Swiping up from the main screen takes you to your Memories, a gallery of all the Snaps you?ôve preserved.

When you?ôve taken a Snap and want to save it, you can hit the button which looks like an arrow pointing down and it?ôll go into your Memory reel. The button is on the bottom left for unsent Snaps, and the bottom right for sent Snaps.
You can save a Snap even if you don?ôt actually send it or post it to your Story ??but you?ôll be able to send it from your Memories later if you want to.
There are a few other functions of Snapchat you can use if you really want to dig deep. Here?ôs a short list:
Here are a few more fun things you can do with Snapchat if you really want to take your Snap game to the next level.
So now you know enough about Snapchat to get you started. Good luck, and getting Snapping!

467,apps,"A security researcher this week uncovered special permissions in Uber?ôs app that allow the company to access new screen-recording features in iOS 11.
Will Strafach, the researcher that uncovered the ?úentitlement,??said these features are normally off limits to app developers without special permission from Apple. To his knowledge, Strafach told ZDNet?ôs Zach Whittaker, Uber is the only third-party app granted such an entitlement.
The specific permission, Apple expert and jailbreak author Luca Todesco told ZDNet, is known as ?úcom.apple.private.allow-explicit-graphics-priority.??It allows developers to read and write to part of the iPhone?ôs memory that contains pixel and display data. He compared Uber?ôs access to that of giving app developers keylogging abilities for iPhone users.
While dubious-sounding, the entitlement was in place before the release of iOS 11, and the company doesn?ôt appear to have been recording screens, nor would we presume it intended to at any point in the future. Sources familiar with the matter tell TNW the feature was originally intended to improve resource management in the Apple Watch. But while the entitlement may not have been intended for recording screens, the worry is that hackers could breach Uber?ôs network and do just that.
It?ôs also unclear why Apple would grant such an entitlement in the first place, given Uber?ôs past indiscretions. Just last year Apple CEO Tim Cook warned the company against tracking iOS users, even threatening to kick Uber out of the App Store if it was caught violating the rules again, according to a NY Times report.
We?ôve reached out to Apple for comment, and hope to learn more as the story continues to develop.

"
468,apps,"Yahoo-owned image and video hosting service, Flickr, was suffering from a glaring flaw that made it possible for malicious agents to upload thousands of unwanted pics to the accounts of random, unsuspecting users.
The defect resided in the Flickr?ôs Upload by email feature, which enables users to upload images straight to the platform by sending emails to a specific address, automatically generated and assigned to users by the hosting company itself.
The vulnerability was discovered by high-schooler and independent security researcher Jazzy, who has since documented the issue at more length over at his blog.

Flickr offers users the option to request a unique email address they can use to upload images to their accounts by mailing them to the address in question. The problem, though, is that anybody who knows the correct address could abuse it to upload images without any user consent.
This prompted Jazzy to dig deeper and seek whether there is a way to extract a long list of Flickr-generated email addresses. While he couldn?ôt breach the website?ôs defenses to snatch any email addresses, he noticed there is an option to change his automatically-generated email and get a new one.
After repeating the procedure a few more times, he noticed a pattern. The email returned by Flickr had some well-defined properties ??this is the formula it followed:
<Random dictionary word><Random number 0-100><Random Dictionary word>@photos.flickr.com
He further spotted that the length of each dictionary word was always shorter than six characters.
With this in mind, he decided to whip up a quick Python script, which would repeatedly change his Flickr email address and record each new unique address in a log file.
He ran the script overnight, generating more than 20,000 addresses. He then went on to write another script, designed to sort through the emails and show how often each dictionary word appeared. The result was surprising, to say the least.
Out of the 23,692 email addresses amassed, Jazzy discovered that Flickr only used a total of 935 unique words. This meant that, the total amount of permutations the email-naming algorithm could generate close to 87.5 million variations. Flickr only has about 50 million users.

This meant that every randomly generated email address has higher than 50 percent chance of belonging to an actual user. And, according to his own estimates, all it would take to deluge all of Flickr?ôs 50 million users with tons of images is a short script, some computing power and a couple of hours.
Jazzy has already notified Yahoo of the vulnerability. Its technical team swiftly amended the flaw and has since rewarded the crafty high-schooler with a ?únice bounty.??Big up to you, Jazzy, well done.
Correction: This piece incorrectly stated that Flickr generates unique email addresses for each user. While the platform does offer this feature, it is something users need to personally request to receive access to. We have corrected our mistake to reflect this more clearly.

469,apps,"Tinder announced today its version of MSN winks: Reactions.
Now, there?ôs a new way to flirt on the most used matchmaking app. Instead of a traditional text reply, you?ôll be able to send your Tinder crush an animated message that takes up the whole screen ??so you can really get your message across.
The newest feature includes laughs, hearts and even a round of applause for that time they made a really good dad joke ??although it?ôs not always fun and games. In addition, women will have an exclusive set of reactions at their disposal, amongst them an animation of a martini being thrown, an eye roll, and a ?úReally?!??Button ??all completely necessary when a guy does not know what he?ôs doing.
Credit: Tinder
The feature was introduced by actress and comedian Whitney Cummings, who is also part of Tinder?ôs ?úMenprovement video series??alongside the real women of Tinder.
The company also aims to improve Tinder experience and practices by rolling out messaging standards. This comes after a series of features introduced over the past months, including swipe to unmatch and newly designed community guidelines which help to build a safer community.
To be honest, these reactions look a little bit like those MSN winks we used back in 2003.
So go on, step up your Tinder game today with a really good reaction.

470,apps,"For all of mankind?ôs greatest achievements, each owes at least a modicum of credit to the one thing they have in common: sex. It could be the desire to have sex. Perhaps it?ôs an attempt to appear more attractive to the opposite (or same) sex. Or maybe it?ôs the perfect storm of hormones leading two teenagers to create a child, destined for greatness, by bumping genitals in the back of a Toyota Tercel outside an In-N-Out Burger.
Knowing what we know about sex and innovation, pairing sex with the blockchain seems a natural progression. And that?ôs exactly what the worst-named application of 2017 intends to do.
SexService.io ??in case you couldn?ôt take the hint from men and women listing a price next to scantily-clad photos ??is an escort platform that protects both prostitutes and their clientele by facilitating hookups via blockchain technology. It?ôs anonymous; the service uses no emails or user credentials, and no one has access to private data as it?ôs encrypted and stored on the blockchain.
It?ôs also touted as a safer, more secure alternative to traditional means of, um, picking up sex workers. All interactions are secure, and the decentralized platform uses a two-step digital payment to process these transactions ??think of it as Coinbase for your junk.
Kidding aside, all studies point to safer prostitution being a better alternative to prohibition. Lust is big business, and conservative estimates peg the global spend at $186 billion. That?ôs a lot of revenue for impoverished countries, like India, home of an estimated three million prostitutes raking in a combined $8.4 billion annually.
It?ôs hard not to poke fun, but sexService.io could be a step in the right direction. By decentralizing payments and user data, the app fills two of the sex industry?ôs biggest holes: payments and discretion. It?ôs not going to fix everything wrong with the sex industry, but it?ôs a start.
No matter how it goes down, sex is a driver of innovation. That statement is as true now as it was in the 1500s when Leonadro da Vinci painted a portrait of Lisa Gheradini, now known as the Mona Lisa ??presumably to get all up in ?òdem delicates.
This article regrettably had the word ?òhookers??in the title of a previous version. We do not condemn sex work in any way and ask for forgiveness of those we offended.

471,apps,"You might want to stay away from Google?ôs Inbox app for Android if you?ôre waiting on an important email ??it turns out the software is suffering from a technical issue that is causing delays in notifications for new emails.
A litany of miffed users have taken to the Google support forums and Reddit to complain that the latest version of Inbox is no longer automatically notifying them of new emails, unless they manually open and refresh the app.
Affected users claim they initially began experiencing delays in notifications around September 15, but reports have significantly increased following an update to the Inbox app Google rolled out a couple of days ago on September 27.
Some users go as far as claiming their Inbox app is serving absolutely no notifications for newly received emails.
The technical complication seems to impact a variety of phone brands and models, including Samsung Galaxy S6, S7 and S8, Nexus 5X and 6, OnePlus 3, 3T and 5, Google?ôs own Pixel and Pixel XL, and many more.
?úI am using Inbox on a Samsung GS8 and emails don?ôt appear unless I open the application and manually refresh the inbox,??one affected user said. ?úI have uninstalled and reinstalled the application. Restarted the device a number of times too.??
Here is what another user had to say:
I am experiencing this issue as well. Inbox by Gmail does not automatically update; it does not matter if the phone is dozing on a counter, or is in my pocket playing music, etc. Regardless of the phone?ôs current state of activity, when I open the Inbox app it shows a stale Inbox. I need to manually pull down to refresh, and then it will display all my new email. This is particularly dangerous as it means I am not receiving priority notifications any longer.
Some comments have suggested the issue could be affecting users that have included the Inbox app in their list of apps optimized for battery performance. Still, many users report adjusting the settings hasn?ôt solved the issue for them.
TNW was able to reproduce the issue on a Nexus 6P handset with the correct settings.
A user under the Alias ScottG_TC has since been able to contact the Google team and notify them about the malfunction. He further said they are already investigating the matter.
In the meantime, you might want to download an additional email client, if you?ôre expecting any important messages.

One of those I recall fondly was a game we played to pass the time as we covered hundreds of kilometers driving to and from our favorite destinations ??and I recently rediscovered it in the form of an Android app.
As far as I know, the game doesn?ôt have an official name ??but I?ôve found a bunch of apps on Google Play that go by variations of ?òDark Stories.??Essentially, it?ôs like the spoken game 20 Questions ??only, instead of having players guess what animal, place, or object you?ôre thinking of, they have to deduce the sinister circumstances that lead up to the situation you describe in a short sentence or two.
Here?ôs how it works: people take turns being the narrator, and read aloud the scenario described on a card in the app. The narrator also reads the solution that?ôs provided, but doesn?ôt reveal it to the group. After hearing the scenario, the other players must then figure out how it took place, and can piece the puzzle together by asking the narrator questions about it. However, the narrator can only answer by responding with ?òyes?? ?òno?? or ?òthat?ôs not relevant.??

Depending on how sharp your group is, or how you?ôd like to play, you can choose to allow the narrator to drop hints, and whether you?ôd like to limit the questioning by setting a timer or deciding on a fixed number of questions. The scenario in the screenshot above is fairly simple, and the solution (click here) should give you an idea of the sort of reasoning required to crack these puzzles.
What?ôs great about this game is that it gets you talking with your loved ones, something that few mobile games manage to achieve. I also love that everyone gets a shot at playing narrator, so it keeps things interesting for as long as you care to play.
I loved this game when I was little, because it never failed to bring my entire family together, whether it was on a road trip or a reunion with relatives. We also looked forward to people bringing in new and more challenging scenarios to figure out ??the more twisted they were, the better. And after rediscovering it a few weeks ago, I found it to be just as fun to play with friends new and old for hours on end.
Give it a go by heading to Google Play and grabbing Dark Stories, which is free and includes 93 scenarios divided into three levels of difficulty. There are similar apps out there, but their puzzles aren?ôt great.
Have you played Dark Stories before, or know a source for more of these puzzles? Let us know in the comments.

474,apps,"Polly has been on a roll of late. Today, though, that roll may be slowing.
A Snapchat integration for polling, the popular third-party app connects to the platform and allows users to add simple multiple-choice polls in Stories, the ephemeral hotbed of millennial activity. Instagram, doing what Instagram does, just added the feature to its own Stories feature: news Polly (and Snapchat) certainly didn?ôt want to hear.
From Instagram:
Today we?ôre introducing an interactive poll sticker in Instagram Stories that lets you ask a question and see results from your friends and followers as they vote.
Whether you?ôre trying to plan tomorrow?ôs outfit, choosing which class to take or figuring out where to go for dinner, now it?ôs easy to share a two-option poll right in your story. After you?ôve taken a photo or video for your story, select the ?úpoll??sticker and place it anywhere you?ôd like ??you can write out your own question and even customize the poll choices.
For Snapchat, the feature-jacking is just the latest in a series of moves by rival Instagram that started with the Stories feature. Once a Snapchat exclusive, Instagram unveiled its own version of Stories last year and has since run away with the millennial market. Snapchat, the once ?úcan?ôt-miss??IPO, is now trading at approximately half of its original value while struggling to maintain a once-insatiable millennial audience.
That audience appears to be fleeing for greener pastures offered by Instagram.
Whether you agree with what Instagram is doing or not, it?ôs hard to argue against its effectiveness. By integrating popular Snapchat features into an app already teeming with millennials, you?ôre decreasing the need to switch between services for exclusive feature sets.
And polls, for Instagram, is an engagement goldmine. Rather than rapidly thumbing through Stories, polls offers the opportunity to hook your following with an in-between offering that could catch those ?òtweeners not wanting to comment, but willing to engage on a more casual level. Simply put, it?ôs engagement on demand and a fine accompaniment to an app that?ôs growing more feature-rich by the day.

475,apps,"Zenkit today released its first iOS app. The app is a welcome addition, and could put Zenkit firmly ahead of Trello in a battle of competing services, at least for iOS users.
Sorry Android fans, your app isn?ôt yet available; but the Zenkit team assures me it?ôs close. I?ôm told the timeline is four to six weeks.
I first heard about Zenkit when our own Matt Hughes profiled the productivity app earlier this year. I was instantly enamored. The web app is the perfect blend of everything I love about Trello, but with customization options and collaborative features it didn?ôt offer. The calendar view, ability to prioritize tasks, and mind map your notes into a full-fledged idea are welcome additions to the Kanban board-style presentation of Trello. And if you prefer the Kanban approach, it?ôs still one of the four available view options in Zenkit?ôs web app.

If you?ôre looking for all the functionality of the web app, you won?ôt find it here.The mobile app isn?ôt quite as feature-rich, at least not yet. But for me, all I really need it to do is add quotes, links, and research material from the iOS share menu. I can handle the heavy lifting, as I often do, at my desk.
The beta version I?ôve used the last two weeks does all I need it to, and the web app is its perfect compliment. If you?ôre a comparison type, think of the mobile version as Wunderlist, while the web app is more traditional Trello competitor.
And in my time using the beta, the app works mostly as you?ôd expect. It doesn?ôt get perfect marks, as I did run into one frustrating omission.  Clicking the ????icon adds a new note to an existing board, but won?ôt let you create a new one.

This, I?ôm told, was a conscious decision to get the product out the door and something the team plans to address down the road. According to founder and CEO Martin Welker:
 We?ôre working hard to try and get as many features from the more-powerful web app into the iOS and Android apps. It?ôs always a question of the resources available on a phone vs. those on a computer. We need to factor in screen size and computing power, which makes building a database on your phone a bit more tricky. We?ôre confident that we can crack it though.
Also on the roadmap:
I?ôll be anxiously awaiting the app?ôs transition into a full-blown Zenkit experience. For now though, the iOS version is a superb compliment to an already exceptional web app.
You can get it today, free, at the App Store.
Update: Zenkit has since released apps for Android and the desktop (Windows, Mac, and Linux)

Businesses which wanted to take advantage of the platform?ôs visual appeal to sell products were hampered by the inability to put links in image descriptions. Some try to skirt it by giving exact searching instructions on how to find the product, but this workaround probably lost more than a few interested-but-capricious customers.
I don?ôt doubt some buyers are willing to do the figurative legwork, but it?ôs also likely a large percentage forgot the item the moment something just as flashy passed through their feed. But now, Instagram is letting stores take advantage of that same short attention span by eliminating the need for buyers to do their own searching.
Instagram made its first overtures to shoppers last November with the introduction of shoppable tags. These allow business to add links directly to their images which take the user to an in-app product page. According to Bigcommerce, up to five products and their prices can be tagged in a given photo. Clicking on a tag lets the user see more information on the product and go directly to its store page to buy it.
While it?ôs debatable whether this evolution is a good thing for our collective wallet, it does seem like the natural progression for Instagram?ôs businesses. Currently the integrations will only work for US users. When asked for comment, Instagram said it had ?únothing to share??about international business.

The new designs are currently available in the latest beta version of the app for Android, according to Emojipedia which first spotted the change. Up until now, the popular messenger used the Apple emoji set on both iOS and Android, as well as the web.
Despite taking the initiative to put together its own designs, WhatsApp certainly didn?ôt hesitate to draw inspiration from Apple?ôs own emoji ??and the influence is difficult to ignore.
While the new emoticons will likely appeal to some users more than the old ones, this move seems like an unnecessary effort given that the new designs will likely confuse both Android and iOS users. Quite frankly, there is already too much choice when it comes to emoji.
The new set of emoji has yet to make its way to iOS ??but will likely land on Apple?ôs mobile operating system in the near future. That is, if the company deems the Android trial successful enough to implement the same designs on iOS.
But since this is still merely a beta version, I wouldn?ôt get too happy ??or mad ??about the new emoji before WhatsApp has taken the steps to roll out the new sketches in the official release.

Soon after the incident, Facebook allowed users in the area to mark themselves safe ??letting those who weren?ôt present to check on the status of their family and friends.
This feature is part of the Crisis Response Hub, where users can also find or offer aid in the wake of the incident. In the case of natural disasters, this is much needed as many are left without homes and need assistance.
Safety Check was introduced in 2014 and is usually activated when major natural crises occur, such as the earthquake in Mexico City last month. In the US, it was first used last year after the Orlando nightclub shootings, where a gunman murdered 49 people.

481,apps,"One thing I used to hate when I initially started as a reporter, but have recently come to (mockingly) appreciate, is the bombastic language companies like to use when describing their products ??the buzzword-infused lingo devised to make you excited even about the most boring of inventions.
This is how you ultimately end up seeing words like ?úbleeding-edge,???úergonomically 3D-printed?? and ?úlifehack??in a pitch about a regular effing water bottle with a rectangular shape.
But to the delight of tone-deaf founders seeking ?úlean solutions??and to the horror of obnoxious PR professionals, it turns out there is a tool that can churn out such content entirely autonomously ??and free of charge.
Built by developer Andrew Davidson, Corporate Gibberish Generator is a hilarious pseudo-productivity tool that automatically puts together buzzword-infused mission statements that also happen to be absolutely devoid of any meaning.
You know, like most of the crappy mission statements you see on the websites of aspiring startups, claiming to be the ?úGoogle of X,??the ?úApple of Y,??and the ?úUber of Z.??
All you need to do is fill in your company name and the generator will readily spill out pompous, generic expressions like:

A particularly nice touch of irony is that the dedicated Company Name field at Corporate Gibberish Generator defaults to AssCo ??which really seems to put things into perspective.
In all fairness, the quirky tool has been around since at least 2004. But it is still pretty entertaining to see how little this asshat parlance has changed over the years. It is even more absurd that it continues to exist on the ?òAbout??pages of so many ambitious new startups.
You know what they say: Change always starts with you.
Now go generate some random-ass mission statements here and learn what verbose jargon you need to avoid when writing yours.
That is, unless you deliberately want to sound like a douche ??in which case, Corporate Bullshit Generator, Corporate B.S. Generator, Corporate Ipsum (the Lorem Ipsum for corporates, if you?ôd like) might come in handy too.

482,apps,"So you?ôve downloaded Snapchat. Now what?
We won?ôt judge you for not being a Snapchat pro already ??you?ôd be surprised how often people consign such a popular app to being something other/younger people are interested in. It can also be hard to find space in your head for another social media app on top of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, Pinterest, and whatever crops up.
Maybe you?ôre like me ??a thousand year-old elephant inside the body of a twenty-something trying to make sense of something you?ôre told is in your wheelhouse (because your older relatives won?ôt stop asking what it?ôs all about, darn it). Or maybe you?ôre older and want to see what the kids are all into nowadays.
But whatever your reasons for not joining the Snapchat legion already, there are several shortcuts that will let you start using it like a pro.
Occasionally Snapchat?ôs original purpose gets lost in the flood of imitators that have cropped up. But originally, Snapchat?ôs biggest draw was its brevity and ephemeral style ??no other major social app let you send pics and messages that vanished after a brief period. You?ôd say something on Facebook or Twitter and it was part of your online identity unless you purged it manually. As Snapchat?ôs founders said in their first blog post in 2012:
And after hearing hilarious stories about emergency detagging of Facebook photos before job interviews and photoshopping blemishes out of candid shots before they hit the Internet, there had to be a better solution.
Snapchat, on the other hand, is and always has been more about natural flow of images and the frivolity that comes with no strings attached. While it originally got some negative publicity as a place for risqu√© photos ??at least one New York Times article implied it was often used to teens to sext one another ??it?ôs since gained a reputation for being the guileless and ridiculous younger sibling of social media apps.
So that?ôs Snapchat?ôs core principle: Take that awkward, unfiltered selfie and send it. Snap a quick pic of a cloud. Make a short video of you lipsyncing to a Nicki Minaj song. It?ôs not going to stay in your digital archive forever. It?ôs about instant gratification, both for yourself and for the people you send the vanishing images and texts to.
Snaps are the app?ôs biggest draw, and Snapchat gives you so many features to enhance them that it seems almost impossible to take a bad one. For starters, lenses are your friends. Rare is the pic that one of Snapchat?ôs whimsical lenses cannot improve.
You have to have a sense of humor before you can really get into it. You can?ôt really use this voice changer lens and look dignified:

Lenses change all the time, as the company is constantly adding new, time- or event-specific lenses such as the rather controversial Marie Curie lens for International Women?ôs Day. Also, linking your Bitmoji ??a cartoon character created by a separate app ??to your Snapchat, can add more
Lenses are probably Snapchat?ôs most famous augmented reality feature, but the app gives you other ways of sprucing up your pics. The most recognizable are filters. Often confused with lenses, filters add two-dimensional images and animations commemorating certain events, locations, and other things.

Filters can do such diverse things as display the current time, temperature, and speed at which you?ôre traveling. Perhaps the best part about filters is that you can layer multiple ones on screen at the same time. Sometimes I like to put pics with the time, temperature, and location filters in a single Story chain and pretend I?ôm a weather channel.
When you use stickers to spice up your image, you?ôll notice they look an awful lot like standard emoji. That?ôs not a bad thing ??they can still be used for cool features like drawing, or sticking them to objects in videos and watching them move.
But suppose you want a sticker that?ôs more than just emoji? You can do that too, with the scissor tool on the right of the screen.
For example, say you have something in one of your pics you want to save as a sticker. In my case, I decided to have my sloth friend have a sip from my bottle of honey (and accidentally made stickers of his face). So I simply outlined the bottle with the scissor tool, and I have a sticker of my honey forever.

Think of your Snapcode as a personal barcode on Snapchat. You can post it anywhere online, and anyone can add you on Snapchat by opening the app and pointing the camera at your code. Here?ôs mine, if anyone is interested in adding me:

Your code isn?ôt just a series of dots and the Ghostface Chillah icon, though. You can also string together a series of five selfies to create a little animation that plays in your Snapcode.
There?ôs another use for Snapcodes, though: if you want to promote a website link, but are tired with settling for a boring URL, you can make a Snapcode that links to it. You turn any phone with a Snapchat app into a yellow QR code reader, essentially.
If you really want to bring attention to a personal or professional event on Snapchat, you can create your own geofilter. These are filters restricted to certain areas, so you can create a filter that brings attention to your local business, wedding, or landmark.
In order to create one, you must set a geofence, or specific location where other Other Snapchat users in the area can use the filter, so it?ôs not really for private occasions.
Credit: Snapchat
One major caveat: Geofilters cost money. Exactly how much depends on how wide of an area you want them to cover, and how long you want the filter to remain active.
Snapchat does allow you to save some of your photos, meaning they won?ôt disappear into the void. If you ever take a really good pic on Snapchat, you can save it to your Memories and download it to your camera roll.
But Snapchat?ôs got a little feature that lets you turn those special photos into works of art ??and I mean in the literal sense. When you edit one of your memories, you can hit the paintbrush button and you?ôll be shown a sample of the works of several artists whose style you can morph your photo into. Here?ôs a side-by-side shot of one of my Memories and its Van Gogh equivalent.

There?ôs really no wrong way to do Snapchat, but hopefully these tips will give you some insight on where to get started. For all you Snapchat veterans out there, what do you recommend for the new user who?ôs just starting out? Let us know in the comments.

484,apps,"Remember Tinder Social ??the group meeting feature that got the popular dating app in trouble for outing its users to their Facebook friends? It turns out that, in addition to this, Social had another glaring privacy issue that made it possible for Tinder users to track their Facebook friends ??and see their exact location.
To demonstrate how intrusive the group meeting feature can be, researchers from cybersecurity firm Detectify developed a creepy Chrome plugin that enabled them to use their Tinder account to triangulate the precise location of their Facebook friends.
As the security experts explain in a blog post, they exploited a well-known privacy vulnerability that allows to export your Facebook friends??Tinder IDs. The next step was to mark this data onto one big map and automate it to continually update users??location with data from the app.
Here is how this looked:

While Tinder has no official API, Detectify resorted to popular sniffing tool Burp Suite in order to detect and hijack the necessary traffic data. This made it possible for the experts to retrieve a list of all of their Facebook friends using Social and also see exactly how far they were from them.
Detectify also worked out how to abuse Tinder to send latitude and longitude coordinates to arbitrarily change their location.
With all this information at hand, the researchers were able to develop an algorithm that automatically triangulated the location of their friends.
In all fairness, Detectify is hardly the first company to exploit this setup.
In fact, Tinder previously addressed this issue and argued it is more of a feature, than a bug. The company later made Social an opt-in feature to further protect the privacy of its users, but it clarified that anybody who activates Social will be vulnerable to this loophole. Since then, it has killed off Social altogether.
Still though, numerous opportunists have already used this workaround to cash in by secretly outing Tinder users.
As Detectify puts it, user location needs to be publicly available for Tinder to work: ?úThey could have made our research harder, but they could not have stopped it.??
So ultimately it is up to you to decide on which side of the trade-off you want to be: Is a date more important to you than your privacy?

We understand since many of you have been Tweeting for years, there may be an emotional attachment to 140 characters ??we felt it, too. But we tried this, saw the power of what it will do, and fell in love with this new, still brief, constraint.
The new limit will be in place for languages that frequently hit the old 140 character max ??which, according to Twitter, is all languages other than Korean, Japanese, and Chinese. The company?ôs data suggests users who tweet in those languages rarely hit the character limit ??less than one percent of Japanese tweets reach 140 characters.

The company said in a blog post that it?ôs now grown large enough that it can handle most DDoS attacks automatically.

Cloudflare says it?ôll offer its Unmetered mitigation of DDoS for layer 3 and 4 attacks (the more common protcol attacks) to all its customers, including those on its free plan; protection for layer 7 attacks are available for the Pro plan (which starts at $20 a month and is meant for professional portfolios and blogs) and upwards.

Available for Android and iOS, PlayOn Cloud makes it possible for users to record and download titles from a variety of leading streaming services, so they could still binge their favorite shows once they go offline ??anytime and anywhere.
In addition to the previously mentioned content providers, the app also supports downloads from YouTube, Yahoo Views, CBS, PBS, CW, ABC, NBC and Fox.
The only downside is that you will have to pay for this privilege. PlayOn?ôs iOS and Android apps are free, but the company will charge $0.99 for each recording. The good thing is that PlayOn also offers various recording packs and bundles for as low as $0.20 a pop. You can look up pricing details here.
Considering that each recording is stored in the cloud ??and therefore available to download locally on any device using the same PlayOn account ??it?ôs not such a bad deal.
One thing to keep in mind is that Netflix already rolled out support for offline viewing for mobile last year. The disadvantage is that not every entry in its catalog is available to stream offline. Another upside to using PlayOn is that, unlike Netflix, downloaded recordings never expire ??unless the user deletes them, of course.
Yes, recordings stored on the cloud will be deleted after 30 days, but they will still be available on your device locally.

?úEver since I upgraded, launching apps is an absolute chore,??one dissatisfied user wrote. ?úSafari, Reddit, ESPN, Yahoo, texts [and more] all have a terrible time opening.

A slew of users have also mentioned having difficulties using the control center from lock screen, including noticing faulty behavior when changing songs or adjusting the volume.
In all fairness, the issue doesn?ôt seem to be affecting all users, with some reporting their iPhones are functioning nice and smooth after updating to iOS 11.
One thing to keep in mind is that minor technical issues following major release updates aren?ôt all that uncommon ?? even for the Big A. The good thing is that you can take some measures to alleviate the damage.
Those who are yet to move to the latest iteration of the mobile OS can check which apps are still not optimized for iOS 11 prior to updating. Unfortunately, if you have already installed the update, your best bet is to simply wait for Apple to distribute fixes in upcoming updates.
You could also opt to revert your iPhone back to iOS 10, but the process is rather cumbersome and not all users are reporting the move has been successful so far. You might be better off holding off for the next iOS 11 update.

496,apps,"Surprise, surprise: it has been confirmed that WeChat gives your personal data to the Chinese government.
The company declared in its 2015 overseas privacy policy:
?úWe may be required to retain, preserve or disclose your Personal Information for a longer period of time:
WeChat is the most popular messaging service in China, it?ôs the local equivalent to WhatsApp or Messenger. It proposes an alternative to the mainstream messaging service regularly blocked in the country.
The terms indicate the app exposes personal information such as name, contacts, email address and even location if users have chosen to share it with the service. This follows other recent aggressive actions by the Chinese government to control online activities.
Tech insiders have long suspected Tencent of breaching users??privacy, the latest update seems to confirm their suspicions.
Can?ôt say they didn?ôt warn you.
Update, 25 September: 
The information in the article implicated that the application sharing information with the government as something new. The statement quoted was was not from their latest Chinese privacy policy, but instead from the global version update of WeChat in 2015. In a message from Tencent, they stated the following:
WeChat and Weixin consider user privacy and data protection not just a regulatory obligation but also a key part of the user experience. Weixin has recently updated its privacy policy to reflect the enhancement of user privacy and data protection laws in China.
Unfortunately this fundamentally pro-privacy update was misinterpreted as an admission that we send all user data to the Chinese government. This is not and has never been the case. Our server to user messages are encrypted.  In case of criminal investigations, we will provide certain information to law enforcement agencies when legally compelled to do so, which is in line with international practices.
More generally, we would like to emphasize the following points: 1) Protection of user data is a core value of the Weixin/WeChat team, and the updated privacy policy was part of an effort to improve upon this core value. 2) The updated privacy policy applies to Weixin users who have registered in China. 3) Reflecting different regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR), a different privacy policy applies to users of WeChat (basically non-China users).  This policy is reviewed and certified by TRUSTe on an ongoing basis.

Users are reporting seeing a dedicated WhatsApp button in the main Facebook app on Android. When clicked, the button acts like a shortcut, opening WhatsApp without the need to leave the Facebook app.
TNW has since obtained images of the feature. Here is how it looks:

In case you were wondering, the dedicated button can be found in the menu area. If you happen to be one of the users in the control group, it should appear at the top, right under your name. But chances are not everyone will be able to see it yet.
The shortcut is currently being tested on the Android version of the app, but it could very well be available to some iOS users too.
According to Arvind Iyer, who tipped us off to this development, the WhatsApp button showed up after he switched Facebook?ôs language setting to Danish. This is not all that surprising given that the company has previously chosen Denmark for other limited rollouts ??like its standalone video sharing app Bonfire.
For context, this is hardly the first time Facebook has been experimenting with integrating its subsidiaries into the main app.
In fact, the company was spotted testing a similar shortcut for Instagram earlier this month.

Back in 2015, the social media giant shortly experimented with adding a WhatsApp send button in the Facebook app, so users can quickly share their photos and posts with contacts. The feature ultimately never made it to the official app though.
As with any other test, there is no telling whether and when the WhatsApp shortcut will become available to all Facebook users.

A clever developer came up with a somewhat simple approach to protecting yourself at the gas station. The CEO and Founder of SparkFun, Nate Seidle, along with programmer Nick Poole, built a free, open-source Android app to detect popular skimmers.
The app detects a specific Bluetooth signal and, if found, it tries to establish a connection and send a command that will verify the existence of a skimmer in your general area. The app is looking for Bluetooth networks with an ID of HC-05, which turned out to be the default on devices Seidle tested; if it finds one you?ôll be alerted.
SparkFun?ôs Bluetooth device-detecting app is called Skimmer Scanner and it?ôs a bare-bones tool that appears to work as intended. It?ôs free and open-source and the developer says it doesn?ôt keep or record any information.
In a fantastic blog post detailing a complete dissection of several of the devices, Seidle explains that most of the criminals are dealing in bulk:
The designers of this skimmer were smart, it?ôs better to make these devices easy to connect to than to add a layer of security. What?ôs the worst that could happen? The device is detected and removed from the pump. Meanwhile, 10 more have been deployed for a total cost of $100.
The only tool necessary is a key to unlock the pump. The locks are basic and there are no more than a few different key designs for all gas pumps ??master keys for the model.
This isn?ôt new; for decades, criminals have been using various computer hardware devices to intercept credit card numbers during transactions. But hardware hacking is no longer the domain of only talented ??albeit shady ??individuals. It?ôs the purview of anyone with a laptop, a car, and the stolen credit card information necessary to buy an easily made piece of hardware online.
While I haven?ôt had the opportunity to ride around looking for skimmers yet, I can happily confirm that there are no skimmers scamming in my office.

The internet giant has now admitted it was indeed running ads on Red ??which should be fully ad-free ??blaming the erroneous occurrence on a technical issue.
The initial ad complaint came from a small group of peeved Red subscribers that took to Reddit to raise their concerns. In fact, one user shared a response from a YouTube representative that suggested the ads in question were part of another format ??print ads ??which was supposedly allowed on the premium service.
Here is the original reply:
Thanks for contacting YouTube. I can definitely understand your concern, since YouTube Red membership promises an ads-free experience across YouTube. I?ôll clarify this for you.
With YouTube Red, you shouldn?ôt be seeing iBanner ad, image ad, pre-roll ad, ad that shows before their video starts (often 30 seconds or skippable after 5 seconds). This includes ads before and during a video, as well as banner ads, search ads, and video overlay ads.

Ad-free videos are supported across all devices and platforms where you can sign in with your YouTube account ??including on compatible smart TVs/gaming consoles and the YouTube, YouTube Music, YouTube Gaming and YouTube Kids mobile apps, if they?ôre available in your location.
From the screenshot, looks like the ad format (print ad) is not supported by the YouTube Red.
But as it turns out ??and as Google explicitly sums it up in its membership details ??this information was not entirely legitimate, but rather a miscommunication on the company?ôs part. Indeed, no ads should appear on YouTube Red.
A supervisor with the YouTube and Google Play Music support team has since contacted the Reddit user (Mark Liederbach), who originally shared the company?ôs response, to clarify that the customer support representative that responded to his complaint had provided him with ?úincorrect information.??
Liederbach, who has already updated the Reddit community about Google?ôs clarification, was kind enough to provide TNW with proof of the email?ôs authenticity. Here is what the supervisor said:
This is [name redacted] a supervisor with the YouTube and Google Play Music support team. It has come to my attention that a member of our team provided you with some incorrect information about the YouTube Red ads-free feature that I?ôd like to correct. YouTube Red members should not see any ads and the screenshot you provided shows an ad that absolutely should be blocked with the service. I sincerely apologize for the previous miscommunication.

Each of these measurements is mapped on your device?ôs screen, which opens up even more possibilities for the imaginative.

Of particular note in the report is that, according to Twitter, it now receives 80 percent fewer TOS requests relating to the promotion of terrorism, apparently thanks to more rigorous internal checks.
The report covers the period from January 1, 2017 through June 30. In that time, Twitter received 338 reports on 1,200 accounts. That?ôs down from the 716 reports they received on the previous report.
That?ôs a major reduction considering last year Twitter received reports on 5,929 accounts. But, just as with last year, that only accounts for a fraction of the accounts suspended for promotion of terrorism in total.
According to to the Twitter Public Policy blog, 95 percent of the time, Twitter?ôs own internal systems detect potentially troubling accounts, and eliminate three-quarters of them before they make their first tweet. In total, Twitter says it removed 299,649 troublesome accounts from the site during the reporting period.
Twitter has expanded the section of the report detailing TOS requests, which covered only ?úpromotion of terrorism??in the last transparency report. The new categories are ?úAbusive Content,???úCopyright,??and ?úTrademark.??Twitter says government TOS requests for promotion of terrorism account for only two percent of such requests.

The Pirate Bay has since confessed its sins on its official blog, claiming the JavaScript mining implementation was ?úonly a test??as part of their efforts to ?úget rid of all the ads??clustered on their site. ??W]e also need enough money to keep the site running,??the admins said.
But should you feel this excuse isn?ôt cutting it for you ??and if you want to stop other websites from doing the same ??there are measures you can take to prevent sites from piggybacking on your CPU resources.
Available for Chrome, minerBlock and No Coin are handy browser extensions specifically designed to block popular crypto miners from using your computing power.
What?ôs especially handy is that, similar to an ad-blocker, you can choose to remove certain sites from your list of blocked domains in case you want to deliberately lend your CPU for usage.
Those interested in more technical details can look up the source code for minerBlock and No Coin (respectively) here and here; both are available on GitHub.
One thing to keep in mind, when making the decision whether or not to get one of these extensions, is that crypto miners ??like Coinhive, the solution implemented by The Pirate Bay ??is that they are hard to spot by users; until, of course, you start noticing the sharp increase in CPU usage.

Next to these solutions, you can also try using JavaScript-blocking extensions like NoScript (for Firefox) or ScriptSafe (for Chrome). Another alternative is to manually add the cryptominers in question to your list of blocked domains in ad-blocker.
There is nothing inherently wrong with experimenting with alternative models to generate revenue. Where The Pirate Bay (and any other sites that do the same) err, though, is failing to alert its users of this ?útest??in advance. Putting this aside and factoring in its awful ads, such sites might actually be onto something.
But as Motherboard so adeptly summed it up, everything ultimately comes down to user consent: It?ôs a choice between trading in your privacy (ads) or computing power (miners) for the right to use a service.
Still, given that The Pirate Bay is hardly the only one busted for surreptitiously borrowing users??CPU to mine crypto, the more concerning aspect here is that there are probably a pile of shady sites out there running the same scheme.

Peeved users have taken to Reddit to voice their frustration the search engine giant has begun displaying ads in its paid Red subscription service, which promised to deliver original content unobstructed by any promo materials.
Here are a couple of mildly annoying examples from users:
As you can see in the screenshots, the service now runs ads both on the home page and underneath certain clips.
One user who reached out to Google to express his dissatisfaction with the development, shared the following response from YouTube support:
Thanks for contacting YouTube. I can definitely understand your concern, since YouTube Red membership promises an ads-free experience across YouTube. I?ôll clarify this for you.
With YouTube Red, you shouldn?ôt be seeing iBanner ad, image ad, pre-roll ad, ad that shows before their video starts (often 30 seconds or skippable after 5 seconds).

From the screenshot, looks like the ad format (print ad) is not supported by the YouTube Red.
But here is the deal: At no point does Google mention the possibility of so-called ?òprint ads??(please see first image in gallery above) showing up under videos in its Red membership details.
In fact, it explicitly goes on to guarantee an ad-free experience:
Ad-free videos are supported on youtube.com and YouTube apps when you are signed in with your YouTube Red account.
With YouTube Red, you won?ôt see ads hosted by YouTube such as pre-roll or mid-roll video ads, banner ads, search ads, homepage banner ads, and in-video text-overlay-ads.
Other promotional content such as video annotations, links to other videos, trailers, or featured or recommended videos may appear.
While our policies do not permit creators to include ads in their content, there could be instances in which a creator includes product placements, incidental branding, or third party-ads in their videos. A typical example of this is a live stream of a concert or sporting event.
Assuming the ?òprint ad??format does indeed fall out of Red?ôs list of excluded ads, Google should have taken the measure to explicitly warn subscribers against this. Otherwise, they might as well go back to the freemium YouTube service coupled with any third-party ad-blocker to get the same ?òad-free??experience Red offers.
One thing to point out is that these ads appear to occur only to a limited extent at the time being. Some users were unable to reproduce the ad from the abovementioned video. However, others have reported spotting pre-roll ads on Red, which is strictly the opposite of what Red?ôs terms and services promise.
While in all fairness the ads in question seem rather unobtrusive, this breach of trust is particularly unsettling given Google?ôs ambitions to build its own ad-blocker for Chrome and destroy shitty ads.
We have reached out to the Big G for a clarification and will update this piece if we hear back.

513,apps,"Following reports from last week, Google has launched Tez, a payments app designed for Android and iOS users in India to send money to each other, as well as pay for purchases at businesses that allow digital transactions.
The app (whose name translates from Hindi to ?òfast?? is built on top of the country?ôs inter-bank Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which allows for instant money transfers at no charge.

Your UPI ID (which looks like ?òyourname@bankname?? but can be edited) is automatically generated if you don?ôt have one already, and is linked to your bank accounts and phone number. You can send someone money simply by entering their UPI ID, or selecting their phone number from your contacts list if they?ôre also using Tez.
There?ôs also an interesting ?òCash Mode??feature that lets you pay and receive money with people near you, simply by using audio. Both users will need to have the Tez app installed ??but they won?ôt need to share numbers or bank account details with other to make it happen.

In addition to protecting privacy, this might also be Google?ôs attempt at simplifying payments for people who are using smartphones for the first time in their lives, and may not entirely comfortable finding and filling out payment details. Tez also supports numerous Indian languages
You can also pay for purchases and services by scanning a business??QR code. If a business has an online presence, they can also sign up to the Tez commercial program, where they?ôll get a channel with which they can communicate with customers on the app via text messages, and allow for streamlined payments.
As with other UPI-based apps, Tez lets you transfer upto Rs. 100,000 ($1,560) and make up to 20 transactions per day.
At launch, we noted a couple of issues with Tez: it requires you to use a Google account and doesn?ôt support G Suite accounts. We also weren?ôt able to calibrate the audio setup, which uses your phone?ôs mic. It isn?ôt yet clear if that drastically affects the Cash Mode transaction system; we?ôll update this post with more information soon.
So what?ôs the game plan for Google here? While UPI transactions are free, the company might look to earn revenue by charging businesses for additional functionality, such as promoting offers through the aforementioned channels system in the app. It?ôs already roped in the likes of Dominos, PVR Cinemas, RedBus, and Jet Airways to support its service.
Presently, Tez doesn?ôt compete directly with digital wallets like those offered by Paytm and Mobikwik, as it only works with your bank accounts.
With that, Google is getting in on the fast-growing digital payments space in India. The company estimates that digital payments in the country will hit $500 billion by 2020; India is a massive market with hundreds of millions of people set to adopt mobile devices and this new wave of digital services over the next few years, so it?ôs no surprise that Google wants in on the ground floor.
If you?ôre in India, you can try Tez right now by grabbing the app for Android or iOS.

514,apps,"Apple has tried its best to channel Steve Jobs??showmanship during its recent presentations, as seen during the company?ôs recent iPhone X launch. But perhaps it goes deeper than that: an AI speech analyzer thinks Steve Jobs and Tim Cook actually have the same speechwriter.
There?ôs plenty of reason to doubt the claim, but it?ôs an interesting finding nonetheless. The AI, called Emma, was created by the developers of Unicheck, a site for detecting plagiarism in college papers and such. Emma uses self-learning algorithms based on natural language processing to analyze a writer?ôs style, and the site?ôs press kit claims Emma has been tested to 85 percent accuracy.
It works simply enough. You feed the AI 5,000 words to analyze a writer?ôs style. Once that?ôs done, you only need to upload 200 different words to determine if they were written by the same person or not. Emma?ôs team plugged in Steve Jobs??2005 Stanford commencement speech and iPhone 4 keynote, and compared it to Tim Cook?ôs 2016 iPhone Event, his WWDC 2017 presentation, and this week?ôs iPhone X event.
For the first two, the AI was ??00 percent??sure they were written by the same person. For this week?ôs iPhone event, the AI was 86 percent sure.

That would be a pretty cool finding if true, but there?ôs reason to be skeptical. Jobs was known to have asked for help from screenwriter Aaron Sorkin for the Stanford speech, but Sorkin says he only ?úfixed a couple of typos.??Apple execs have definitely had speech writers in the past, but Jobs??official biography suggests that he had always written his own presentations. Unless the biography is wrong, something changed starting with the Stanford speech, or Jobs has become a literal ghost writer, the pieces don?ôt quite add up.
More importantly, the AI just doesn?ôt get it right all the time. I plugged in 5,000 of my own words and compared them to TNW?ôs other writers, and the AI was correct around 80 percent of the time. That?ôs in line with the company?ôs accuracy claim, but notably, the AI always thought my colleague Abhimanyu Goshal?ôs pieces were my own ??in one case with ??00 percent??certainty. Incidentally, Abhi and I tend to cover the most similar topics.
While my preferred explanation is that Siri is an ancient AI that has been writing Apple?ôs speeches all along, my guess is Apple has simply done its best to maintain Steve Jobs??style and spirit. After all, Jobs??keynotes had the power to define entire generations of technology; there?ôs a reason the Steve Jobs movie ??written by Sorkin, by the way ??is structured to take place during three product launches. Like they say ??if it ain?ôt broke, don?ôt fix it.

515,apps,"Don?ôt you just hate it when you click on a link and it contains a loud ad or video that begins playing on its own? Nobody asked for that, and Google is putting an end to this abhorrence in Chrome soon.
Version 64 of the cross-platform browser, which is slated to arrive in January 2018, will only allow autoplay for videos and ads if there?ôs no sound, or if you indicate that you want to watch that content. This will apply to both desktop and mobile versions of Chrome.

So if you?ôre beginning to hate on your preferred national news site or blog because it embarrasses you when you?ôre browsing in public, you?ôll be able to stop that nonsense once and for all this October.
It seems like these features might be part of a larger plan to tackle crappy ads in Chrome; Google noted in June that it intended to block ads that don?ôt meet its standards for a decent browsing experience.

To enable it, open iMessage, head to the app store, and then press ?òManage.??Finally, tap the switch next to the Spotify icon to enable it. Spotify will then show up in your installed apps.

Note: if you?ôve configured iMessage to automatically add apps to the drawer, you can skip this.
Functionality wise, it?ôs pretty limited, as you?ôd expect from an iMessage App. It won?ôt share what you?ôre listening to, or let you easily access your most recent tracks. Rather, it lets you share 30-second snippets of individual songs from Spotify?ôs massive collection of music.

519,apps,"We might have to put the GIF vs JIF debate aside for a second: It turns out Facebook is flush with animated images that could potentially upset a large group of users on its platform, including content showing upbeat animations of Hitler?ôs name and other potentially insensitive language.
Curiously, while Facebook filters out some of these searches from the Messenger mobile app for iOS and Android, this isn?ôt the case on desktop.
The images in question are auto-generated text-GIFs based on user input sent through the search feature. All of these templates were generated by third-party service Legend, which is one of the many content providers the social media titan has partnered with.

In all fairness, the GIF-finder on mobile doesn?ôt weed out such imagery entirely either, with some potentially distrubing content showing up when looking up certain keywords partially.
Here are a couple of examples captured by our social media director Matt Navarra:

Interestingly, the comment and status post GIF feature (on desktop) seems to be more heavily moderated than the one in chat.
Here is what happens when you search for the same words there:

Facebook initially introduced the dedicated GIF button in chat and Messenger back in 2015. In fact, with almost 13 billion animated images sent via the social media platform just last year, the company recently extended the functionality to regular comments and status posts.
As previously pointed out, the content came not directly from Facebook, but from a bunch of third-party services like Giphy and Legend.
But despite the popularity of the functionality, Facebook opted not to monitor the GIFs itself and instead trusted its community with the task to self-report potentially controversial and insensitive content. The company would then forward such reports to the supplier and ask them to remove any violating images.
Unfortunately, it appears this strategy hasn?ôt been working out exactly as intended so far. Facebook has faced backlash for spreading antisemitic animations on at least two occasions this year alone.
When asked about its GIF removal policy back in July, a Facebook Messenger spokesperson told Forbes the following:
The GIFs that can be sent on Messenger are supplied by third parties, and we apply our community standards to all content on Messenger and Facebook. If we are made aware that a third-party supplier is violating our policies, we reach out to the supplier to ensure they address the issue by removing the violating content.
One thing to keep in mind is that not all images containing controversial material are inherently offensive.
In fact, Russian activists used colorful images showing President Vladimir Putin in drag to protest the country?ôs anti-gay laws. The tactic was so successful that Russia eventually banned the image in question.
So before you go on and report an image, you ought to ask yourself: Is calling for more censorship the only solution here?

520,apps,"Thanks to a series of incremental improvements to its backup and restore feature, Google has made it fairly easy to migrate from one Android device to another without the hassle of setting up your handset all anew ??that is, unless you leave your phone idle for too long.
A miffed user has taken to Reddit to complain the Big G automatically deleted his backup without any notification. The incident took place after he purportedly parted with his Nexus 6P handset a few months back and replaced it with an older iPhone while he was looking for a more viable Android replacement.
?úLast week I randomly glanced at my Google Drive Backup folder, and the Android backup for my 6P was missing,??the dissatisfied user said. ?úContacting Drive support confirms that there?ôs no recovery.??
Blindsided by this development, the user found this page where he spotted a disclaimer that backups automatically get assigned an expiration date once you stop using your phone for two weeks or longer.
?úYour backup will remain as long as you use your device. If you don?ôt use your device for 2 weeks, you may see an expiration date below your backup,??the warning reads. There is no mention of a standard expiration period.
Though wiping unused accounts clean is a practice many storage services ??including Dropbox ??adhere to, it turns out Google gave no indication that the backup was due for removal: ??N]o notification, no email, no proactive notice at all, and most importantly, no option to use the 100gb of my Drive storage to keep my fucking backup.??
Starting with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, the internet giant made it possible to back up not only contacts and calendar, but also apps, call history and device settings (like wi-fi passwords). According to a 9to5Google report, backups would last for about 10 before they expire.
We have contacted Google for a clarification on precisely how long backups are stored prior to deletion and will update this post with more details should we hear back.
Meanwhile, better keep an eye out on your backups.
Update: A spokesperson for Google has reached out to TNW with the following statement:
it is the case that after two weeks, you may see an expiration date for your backup on Android. Users can see when their devices were last backed up and when these backups expire in the Backup section of the Google Drive app for Android. We?ôre always looking to improve the user experience on Android, and so we encourage users to leave feedback, as outlined in this forum post.
So there you have it: Go let the Mountain View heavyweight know you?ôd like to be notified before your backup vanishes and they might start sending reminders in future versions.

If you want to try out the app for yourself, and you don?ôt live in Denmark, you?ôll have to get creative.
For starters, if you don?ôt actually live in Denmark, you?ôll need a second Apple ID. That might sound daunting at first, but it?ôs quite easy. This page has complete instructions, but here?ôs a quick primer.
First, go to the Featured page on the App Store, and sign out of your existing account, then hit ?úGet??on a free app ??any free app. You?ôll be prompted either to sign in or create a new ID. Create a new ID and follow all the steps. When you have to enter a country, select ?úDenmark.??

From there, it was as simple as going to the App Store and downloading Bonfire. I was able to use my existing Facebook account and jump right into it from there.

It?ôs a fun little app, and I enjoyed giving it a quick whirl. I can only contact Matt Navarra on there at the moment, so I couldn?ôt test it with an extensive group of people.

523,apps,"During its annual special event yesterday, Apple lifted the lid on its all-new iPhone X ??a handset it labels the future of smartphones. But it seems the future will be a little more of a hassle for developers and designers, than it will be for consumers.
The iPhone X represents a significant departure from the iterative form factors we?ôve come to expect from Apple, introducing an enhanced (almost) edgeless OLED display, a new FaceID facial recognition technology and a rounded all-glass design. But perhaps its most eye-catching aspect currently remains the notch at the top of the screen.
It certainly was one of the highlights on the Twitterverse, attracting a pile of doubting eyes and cheeky wisecracks mostly oriented at the awkward challenge it presents to appmakers:

??@jedmund (@jedmund) September 12, 2017

This is from the Apple video about how to handle the notch. This is an Apple-sanctioned example of what ""optimized"" looks like.
??@jedmund (@jedmund) September 12, 2017

The Big A has released its Human Interface Guidelines for building apps for the X ??and, indeed, it appears appmakers will have a few more things to worry about when developing for the new flagship.
Unlike the 6, 7 and 8 which sport 4.7-inch panels, the X is not only a little taller (145 points to be exact), but also has rounded corners. This means that if creators continue to follow the old standards when building apps for the new flagship, some areas of the screen might remain unused ??or the notch might hide the app interface.

With this in mind, the Cupertino giant instructs appmakers to ?úensure that layouts fill the screen and aren?ôt obscured by the device?ôs rounded corners, sensor housing, or the indicator for accessing the Home screen.??
Among other things, this includes making sure that interactive controls don?ôt appear at ?úat the very bottom of the screen and in corners,??that the interface doesn?ôt bring attention to the device?ôs rounded corners, and that the user interface isn?ôt clipped by the notch.
Here is how that might look like
The good thing is that, according to official Apple footage (you will need Safari to open it), not every app will require custom tailoring for the X ??and even if it does, the company?ôs new UIKit and XCode 9 software should make this a fairly easy task.
We already know mobile carriers are going to hate the notch, time will tell whether this will be the case with developers too.
Meanwhile, those interested can peruse the full guidelines here.

Facebook working on a private profile mode which you can share with just a small circle of close friends 
h/t Devesh Logendran pic.twitter.com/yqbKYN3H5m
??Matt Navarra ‚≠êÔ∏è (@MattNavarra) September 10, 2017

The tip came to us courtesy of Devesh Logendran, who found the feature after digging through the APK for the latest Facebook for Android beta. Unfortunately, the ?òCreate a Private Profile button??doesn?ôt actually work, so we have no clue what exactly a private profile entails.
You can already hide certain parts of your profile and timeline so they are only visible to specific people, so it?ôs possible this new feature is simply streamlining the features already available on Facebook, but it sounds a little more thorough than that. It?ôs also not clear whether your close friends will know that they?ôre viewing a special, private version of your profile. I?ôd hope so; after all, you probably don?ôt want them blabbing about something you meant to share privately.
Private profiles could help Facebook feel a little more personal, but the managing who can see what information can quickly become tedious. It?ôs like circles on Google Plus; potentially very useful, but often more effort than they?ôre worth. Still, it?ôs clear the company is thinking of ways to separate your close friends from acquaintances, given it?ôs testing a similar ?òfavorite friends??feature on Instagram.
Of course, Facebook tests new features all the time, so it?ôs possible this one will never come to fruition. We?ôve contacted Facebook for more information and will update this post if we hear back.

For those out of the loop, a tweetstorm is simply a thread of tweets that follow the same topic or conversation. You can whip up your own simply by tweeting and then replying to that tweet to get started; then, you?ôll need to reply to each tweet in succession to keep the thread going. Repeat as many times as necessary.
Now, a Twitter user who goes by the alias Devesh Logendran shared screenshots of a built-in tweetstorming feature with TNW, that appears to automatically split text up into individual tweets and appending a tweet count at the end.

With this, Twitter could effectively do away with the character limit, as far as the experience for users is concerned. The 140-character restriction can seem daunting to new users who may be accustomed to services that don?ôt limit text posts, so this might also help them get on board the Twitter train more easily.
Twitter refused to comment on the feature, but hopefully it?ôll arrive on the service?ôs mobile apps sooner than later. Until then, you can use Storm It on Android and iOS to create, preview and publish tweetstorms like a veteran.

534,apps,"It?ôs all fun and games on Facebook until you accidentally post something meant for ?úFriends only??to your public profile. How can you prevent something like that from happening?
Facebook offers some pretty in-depth privacy options, if you take advantage of them. In case you?ôve never really looked at your privacy settings or what they mean, here?ôs a quick primer.

This option allows you to preemptively control the privacy of your posts. You can choose ?úFriends,???úPublic??and ?úFriends Except?¶‚Ä?which lets you block certain Friends from seeing your post. Whichever option you have selected will be the default option when you make a new status.
This is just what it sounds like, the ability to control who can check out your Friends list. You have the option here of not allowing anyone to see this, the ?úOnly Me??option.

This is a kind of nuclear option, as far as Facebook Privacy goes. When you need to quickly switch all of your old posts to Friends-only, this is much quicker than going through every post in your Activity Feed and manually changing it all to a limited audience.

You can put an absurd amount of information in your Facebook About Page, but you might not necessarily want everyone to see your email address or your phone number. Some of the options can be limited to ?úOnly Me,??which is useful. If you do a Privacy Check on Facebook, you?ôll see a complete listing of which options are active on which pieces of info.

This option limits who can send you Friend Requests, though sadly the most private you can make it is ?úFriends of Friends.??I know more than a few people who?ôd be fine with having a ?úNo One??option.
These options let you control who can use outside info to look you up on Facebook. If you?ôre like me, your email and phone numbers are out for all to see, but you might not necessarily want anyone using that information to find your private profile. You can also decide whether search engines can link to your profile.

If you?ôve linked games or apps to your profile, they may have access to more of your information than you?ôd like ??some can post on your behalf, for example. The easiest way to delete them is to do a Privacy Check, skip to the section titled ?úApps,??and hit X as you see fit.
Do you prefer to keep it private on Facebook, or do you leave everything open to the public? Let us know in the comments.

535,apps,"The Google Pixel is often considered to have the very best camera around thanks to some truly effective software processing. Now you can get that same processing on almost any recent Android flagship.
While you?ôve been able to sideload Google?ôs Camera app for some time, the actual processing that gives the Pixel its beautiful photos is still exclusive. Called HDR+, the technology not only increases dynamic range, like traditional HDR modes, but reduces noise and improve colors as well.
In very oversimplified terms, the camera basically takes an extremely fast burst of shots, and then combines the best bit of each image for the final exposure. I?ôve yet to try a camera that matches the Pixel?ôs consistency in rendering accurate dynamic range, realistic night-time scenes, and overall vibrant colors.
As first reported by XDA, an enterprising developer named B-S-G has ported the Pixel?ôs camera software to work on virtually any phone running a Snapdragon 820, 821, or 835. That means the vast majority of flagship devices released in the US since 2016. You can read XDA?ôs post on the most recent update to the port, or download the APK file directly here.
Keep in mind you?ôll have to enable apps from unknown sources in order to install the APK. While XDA says its tested the file to make sure it?ôs safe, you?ôre still installing at your own risk.
On the phones I tested, the improvements ranged from minor to shocking, and, more importantly, Google?ôs camera was rarely worse than the stock app. And I?ôve tried quite a few phones, though I spent most of the time testing with Samsung?ôs S8, a pre-production LG V30, and the Essential Phone. I?ôve also tested HTC?ôs U11 a bit, which has the same sensor as the Pixel, but adds optical image stabilization and a faster aperture. The HTC U11?ôs better hardware puts it on par with the Pixel in most cases, but using the Google?ôs own Camera app makes it even better.
One of the most obvious signs a photo was taken with a bad camera are blown out skies. Google?ôs processing managed to avoid doing so better than any other camera app, even thought it?ôs not optimized for any of their sensors. While your mileage may vary ??perhaps Google?ôs processing isn?ôt quite to your taste ??it means skies were consistently blue, clouds had the texture they?ôre supposed to, night-time scenes had accurate color, and noise reduction was tastefully balanced with detail.
Here?ôs a gallery along with some descriptions for context. In every image, the Google Camera app is on the right:
Google Camera app vs default manufacturer apps

There are a few caveats. It?ôs tweaked software, so you may encounter some bugs. You will have to switch back to your manufacturer?ôs camera for any custom features, and HDR+ only works on the main rear camera. You?ôre out of luck if you want to use the wide angle camera on the V30 or the telephoto on on the OnePlus 5, for instance. And it?ôs not always better; Google?ôs Camera isn?ôt optimized for non-Google devices, so there are occasionally strange artifacts like the extra graininess and flare on the S8.
Still, it?ôs a general improvement across the board, and I can only hope Google opens up its processing to other devices. If you?ôve been unhappy with your cell phone camera, it?ôs at least worth a shot.

536,apps,"When YouTube introduced HDR playback on compatible TVs nearly a year ago, we lamented the fact the feature wasn?ôt available on mobile devices. Fret no more: YouTube is rolling out the feature to a select few devices starting today.
If you?ôre not familiar, HDR video is similar to HDR photography in the sense that it allows for a greater range of tones between the brightest and darkest parts of an image. However, it requires an HDR screen to display the full range of tones. Said screen needs to be able to feature both high brightness and contrast for you to display the range of tones, as well as support a wide gamut of colors than usual. In many cases, the improvement?ôs yielded by HDR are more notable than the jump from 1080p to 4K.
Unfortunately, most people don?ôt yet have HDR TV?ôs yet, let alone watch YouTube on them, but plenty do have HDR-capable phones. Current compatible phones include the LG V30, Samsung S8, Samsung Note8, Sony Xperia XZ Premium, and Google Pixel. The last one comes as a surprise, as the phone is not technically HDR certified. I?ôm also surprised the LG G6 isn?ôt there, given it was one of the first phones on the market with HDR, but Google says it?ôs working to bring HDR to more devices.
I?ôve already tested it on the S8, Note 8, and V30, and the footage looks gorgeous. Unfortunately, there?ôs no way to turn it off if you want to do a comparison, but I did compare some videos on the S8 and Note 8 ??the S8 with the updated YouTube app, and the latter without it ??and there?ôs a subtle but palpable improvement in color accuracy and shadow detail.

Users will be able to use their phone?ôs or tablet?ôs camera and microphone to add their own face and commentary to what they?ôre streaming.
Streamers will also see updates to the chat moderation features. Now streamers and their moderators will be able to hold suspect messages for approval, keeping live chats clean. The system will also log which messages the streamer approves and will apparently get better at judging what they consider to be acceptable.
These updates should make streaming from YouTube Live more community-oriented, especially if it means faster, cleaner chats.

554,apps,"Facebook is finally looking into cashing in on WhatsApp?ôs massive $22 billion acquisition deal.
The Facebook-owned messaging service is planning to eventually start invoicing companies for recently introduced features that help bridge the gap between businesses and consumers, WhatsApp COO Matt Idema told Fox Business.
?úWe want to put a basic foundation in place to allow people to message businesses and for them to get the responses that they want,??Idema said. ?úWe do intend on charging businesses in the future.??
Unlike Messenger which relies on advertising revenue, WhatsApps monetization model will involve streamlined communication features for fielding customer enquiries and sending out updates to followers. To help users tell apart businesses and individuals, the company is also rolling out dedicated verification badges.
Still, it is worth noting that Idema doesn?ôt entirely rule out the possibility WhatsApp could one day display ads.
The good thing is that, in order to contact customers, companies will have to receive an approval from the user. A spokesperson for the company has since clarified that the feature will work on opt-in basis.
Companies in Europe, Brazil, India and Indonesia are already running trials with the features, according to reports. One of the first giants to test the new function is KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.
This development adds more credibility to previous reports, suggesting Facebook has been quietly looking into monetizing WhatsApp after it abolished its $0.99 sign-up fee, when it first acquired the messaging service back in 2014.
More details about the paid features will follow in an upcoming blog post, slated to arrive next Tuesday.

555,apps,"With two billion monthly active users, more than half of all netizens are now on Facebook. In fact, the social media platform has become so integral to the internet that a large number of sites nowadays contain small chunks of Facebook code.
As New York-based developer Ben Regenspan explains in an insightful Medium entry, six percent of the top 10,000 most-trafficked websites load content from Facebook?ôs servers. For most of them, that content is likely its SDK, which is required to display features such as the Like button and the comment section.
But more intriguingly, it turns out that the company?ôs kit accounts for about 16 percent of the size of all Javascript the average web page loads ??and there is very logical reason why this is the case: That?ôs because Facebook packages all of its web features and widgets in the same kit.
While this makes it easier for developers to get the individual features they need from the software library, it also means stuffing websites with tons of code that will likely remain unused or idle, at best. The problem here is that this convenience significantly affects the overall website performance.
To get a better idea of what?ôs inside the SDK, Regenspan has put together a nifty graphic to illustrate this:
Credit: Ben Regenspan
As he goes on to point out, the issue is that a considerable block of the SDK is made up from features that rarely ever come in function. True, Facebook could have released those tools in separate APIs, but since it has incentive to encourage websites to use its SDK, it has opted not to.
For example, Canvas (Facebook?ôs system for apps loaded inside the platform itself) accounts for 1.53 percent of the whole package, with support for legacy features accounting for another 3.53 percent. These are admittedly some of the less popular components of the SDK, but given they account for 5.06 percent of the SDK, it?ôs not unreasonable to include them.
More problematic is how much of the software library is made up from Polyfills ??a whopping 15.34 percent. For those unfamiliar, polyfill utilities are ?úused to supply features that are found in newer browsers to older browsers.??
Unlike Canvas and legacy support, most polyfill-like tools added to the SDK are already ?úincluded in browsers used by the vast majority of internet users.??So in a sense, a component that accounts for 15 percent of the overall package, is only used by less than one percent of all internet users.
Now, there are other reasons to distribute these features as one SDK. Given how rarely it changes, most users have already downloaded the package to their device. And even if they haven?ôt, the time it takes to download is only marginal.
But if every big company follows the same approach, things start to add up ??and this could have a negative impact on performance.
Regenspan estimates that the Facebook kit takes about 50ms (1/20th of a second) to load on the new MacBook Pro, but this number just about doubles on the Google Pixel, where it takes 1/10th of a second to load.
Another nuisance is that it undermines the efforts of developers to optimize code. Imagine toiling for days to shave off a tenth of your own code, only to see this space filled up by a massive chunk of mostly unused code. Not exactly satisfying.
Yes, there are some workarounds that will alleviate the total impact of the SDK. Opting to load the Facebook SDK only when needed is one such technique. But then again, this is more of a cheat, rather than a legitimate solution. In fact, this is the exact same approach we take with our comment section here at TNW.
But then again, most people only need the SDK to get the dedicated Facebook Like button on their site; and given that the social media heavyweight has gradually been making the Like counter of pages less prominent on its platform, is this move even worth the hassle anymore?

Currently, Facebook Watch curates content from partnered companies. So you?ôd be watching live sports, CrossFit, and new shows courtesy of ABC, Buzzfeed, Vox, and the like.
To gain attention from advertisers, Facebook needs more viewers, and somehow I doubt it?ôs going to do that without more individual talent. YouTube wouldn?ôt be half the cash cow it is without single-person acts. Things like sports and television really only came after the fact.

Instead, the red play button that?ôs served as the app icon and visual identifier in a myriad of ads now lives to the left of the wordmark. The red color is also brighter now.

It?ôs immediately familiar, but I think I?ôm going to miss the quirkiness of the old design. I feel the wordmark now looks a bit bland without the red blob around it. Still, YouTube says the change was inspired by our multitude of devices; the new logo is more adaptable fpr different screen sizes. From its announcement post,:
The bright red cherry on top of this update sundae is a refreshed YouTube Logo and YouTube Icon. Designed for our multi-screen world, the updated Logo combines a cleaned up version of the YouTube wordmark and Icon, creating a more flexible design that works better across a variety of devices, even on the tiniest screens. Why?ôs it more flexible? When room is limited (say on a smartphone) you can use the brightened up Icon as an abbreviated Logo, which will be seen more easily and read more clearly.
Logo aside, we?ôve seen most of the new look already. YouTube has been testing its new design for months, opening it up for anyone to try back in May.

Meanwhile Amazon has improved on the speakers, which are surprisingly decent for the size thanks to Dolby Atmos tuning. They get pretty loud too.

Then there?ôs the obvious caveat that this is still a $79 tablet. The cameras both suck, the battery is slow to charge, and I wish it used USB-C so I could stick with one charger. Some people will hate the Amazon ads on the lock screen (you can pay $15 more to remove them), and I also have no idea how it will perform 2-3 years down the road.
But so long as you keep your expectations in check, the Fire HD8 is an easy choice for anyone who doesn?ôt need top-of-the-specs. If you just want a tablet to watch video, browse the web, and read books, the HD8 will should keep you plenty happy for less than a Benjamin.

The game is now listed on Google Play and you can pre-register to be notified when it launches (Ustwo hasn?ôt announced a release date yet). The original Monument Valley costs about $4 in the store, so expect to see a similar price (if not a bit higher) for the sequel when it?ôs out.

In case you haven?ôt tried it before, I highly recommend Monument Valley for its beautiful art style and clever puzzles full of Escher-inspired spaces to keep you engrossed for a couple of hours. It?ôs hard to believe the game is already three years old, as it hardly shows its age.

573,apps,"Apps can change drastically in what seems like a very short span of time. Just ten years ago, the word ?úapps??would probably not have conjured such an instant reaction in any of our brains.
Now, though, apps are a major part of how we communicate, entertain ourselves, and interact with the world.
Many apps have come and gone over the years, and some that were incredibly popular at time of launch aren?ôt even available now. But some have stuck around for several years. They?ôve evolved so much since then that seeing the previous iterations of some of them can look very alien. Did our favorite apps really look so primitive at the time?
Here are a few favorites, how they used to look, and how they look today.
Back in the day, Facebook was just a simple, tile-based interface. Compared with today?ôs app and its pretensions to being Snapchat, the original app couldn?ôt do very many things, but it was utilitarian.

Originally, Facebook ran from a special mobile URL on iPhones before releasing an official app for iOS in 2008. An Android app followed in 2009.
Everyone?ôs favorite short-form social media app didn?ôt really have a mobile app on either of the two major mobile OSes until 2010.

The current Twitter app was originally a third-party client called Tweetie. Twitter acquired the app in 2010 and rebranded it. The version of it you see on the left was part of Tweetie?ôs design, but several elements have carried over into the modern app we all know and use today on iPhones. Twitter for Android was released the same year.

The notetaking app has been around for almost ten years now, and it has evolved to be cleaner and brighter. Still, its basic functions ??creating notes from text, pictures, and audio ??are intact, and the modern iteration is much more navigable.
The go-to app for music identification had already been around (albeit not in the same form) for six years before it hit the App Store. Since then, it?ôs become a mainstay on music lovers??phones.

The app has changed surprisingly little in terms of recognizable aesthetics. The major difference between the two is how the circle in the center now pulses instead of swirls while you?ôre trying to identify a song. The app would always link to a digital store, allowing you to easily purchase the music. It has since expanded its options to include Spotify and Pandora connections.
Out of all the apps I use on a daily basis, I think Netflix has changed the most dramatically in terms of aesthetics.

From a simple, red-and-bisque-colored interface that emphasized user ratings to a black interface that emphasizes the content?ôs art and feel. Needless to say, Netflix has also moved into its own programming, which is usually put forth much more than older movies.
The app which transformed radio in the age of the smartphone was named Time?ôs iPhone app of the year when it officially debuted in 2008 ??though the app was partially developed on jailbroken iPhones, before the release of Apple?ôs SDK.

The app has become more personalized, with the color scheme reflecting the album playing. The service has also launched a Premium version, with unlimited access to albums and songs.
The app that lets you explore the globe was fairly sophisticated even when it debuted on iOS in 2008. It allowed you to survey 3D portions of terrain, and read information from Wikipedia on each location you tapped.

Now the app includes more detailed 3D imagery, along with info cards from Google itself. As of a few months ago, it also includes guided tours of the planet.

574,apps,"Code42 has announced that it?ôs shutting down its CrashPlan for Home data backup service on October 23, 2018. After that, you won?ôt be able to retrieve your files. The company says it?ôs shifting its strategy to ?úfocus exclusively on enterprise and small business segments.??
That?ôs a bummer, because CrashPlan was one of the best set-it-and-forget-it backup services out there, while also being reasonably priced at $59 a year for unlimited storage.
So, what are your options now that it?ôs going away? For starters, you can simply migrate to CrashPlan for Small Business. You won?ôt be charged until your existing subscription runs out; after that, the Small Business plan will cost you $10 per device pr month.
You?ôll get a 75 percent discount on this plan for 12 months after you?ôve migrated. However, this service doesn?ôt include support for computer-to-computer backups, meaning you can?ôt copy your files over to a second system.
CrashPlan has also partnered with its competitor Carbonite to help users make the switch. If you choose to move, you?ôll be charged $60 a year for unlimited storage with a single computer, and you won?ôt be charged for the first 60 days.
Another formidable alternative is Backblaze. At $50 a year, it?ôs 10 bucks cheaper than the other two. The only drawbacks are that it doesn?ôt yet offer a dedicated Linux client (you can use B2, but it could be pricier depending on your needs) and that it doesn?ôt allow for unlimited file versioning.
Google Drive now offers a Backup and Sync tool, but it?ôs expensive at $100 a year per TB of storage. The only way this makes sense is if you only have a small amount of space and want all your files and data to live exclusively in Google?ôs cloud (and even then, I?ôd recommend that you consider other options).
Hopefully, these services will offer easy, automated methods for moving your data before your subscription runs out.
Which backup service are you moving to now that CrashPlan is going away, and why? Share with the class in the comments.

According to a spokesperson:
Now you never have to worry about getting the word out to all your family and friends. Whether you?ôre looking for vacation recommendations or notifying a group about the address for a party, the text-based status feature allows you to update your contacts in a fun and personal way.
Users have the option to select the font and background color of the status update. Pictures of the feature show the status will also display links. The feature will rolled out to iOS and Android users today, and will also be available to those who use the web client.
All in all, it looks like a cheerful update, especially if you?ôre a touch camera-shy, like me. It appears to be functionally similar to what Facebook introduced to its text statuses last year.

Safety Check isn?ôt perfect ??sometimes it prompts people far outside the crisis area to check in, as our Matthew Hughes pointed out from first-hand experience. When it originally debuted, it was for natural disasters, but has since expanded to include multiple different kinds of crises, including terror attacks.
It?ôs a sad state of affairs that the Facebook Safety Check needs to be more prominent because, in an age of consistent and frequent global crises, more people need it than ever. But at least Facebook is trying to help, flawed though its tool might be.
Facebook will be rolling out the feature over the next few weeks.

578,apps,"Stock photo vendors might not be all that screwed up in the end. Only a week after Google released a paper detailing how its researchers built an algorithm that automatically removes watermarks from stock photos, Shutterstock has already put together an antidote.
Taking a cue from the internet giant?ôs tips on how to strengthen watermarks, the popular stock photo distributor managed to reverse engineer Google?ôs software in order to stop copyright thieves from editing out watermarks and using their images for free.
To pull this off, its engineers built a smart watermark technology that counteracts the algorithm by deliberately inserting minor inconsistencies in the watermark patterns. The solution purportedly uses machine learning to continuously confuse Google?ôs software.

?úThe challenge was protecting images without degrading the image quality,??said Shutterstock CTO Martin Brodbeck. ?úChanging the opacity and location of a watermark does not make it more secure, however changing the geometry does.??
The solution came not without a little help from the source itself.
?úGoogle published a white paper [PDF] outlining a way of using computer vision technology to eradicate watermarks from stock image collections on a large-scale,??Brodbeck added. ?úShutterstock was notified before the paper was published and quickly began working to address the areas highlighted.??
Thanks to this collaboration between the two companies, Shutterstock?ôs new technology introduced several variables to its watermarks structures to make it difficult for programs to identify recurring patterns.
?úThe result was a watermark randomizer that our engineering team developed so that no two watermarks are the same,??Brodbeck explains. ?úThe shapes vary per image and include contributor names. By creating a completely different watermark for each image, it makes it hard to truly identify the shape.??
According to the Shutterstock CTO, Google has already tested the new solution and found it to be functional. You can head to this page to see how the updated watermark protector works in action.

579,apps,"YouTube might be getting a nifty facelift pretty soon. Google appears to be testing a new user interface for its video hosting platform that will make it much easier to browse for content while watching videos on your phone.
The current YouTube layout lets you minimize videos in the bottom so you can easily glance through other clips at the same time. While the feature is somewhat helpful, there?ôs not much else you can do with it now.
The new design seeks to amend this by giving users a little more control over playback. Anytime you minimize a video in the bottom, users will now see dedicated playback buttons next to the thumbnail. The new layout includes the standard ?òX??button to close clips and a separate pause/play button.
In addition to the buttons, Google is now also displaying the title of the video next to the thumbnail.
The change was first spotted by Redditor Therexin who took to the Android subreddit to notify fellow users about the new feature.
The user has since shared a GIF that shows how the new design looks. Here it is:

As some users have already noted, the modification resembles the YouTube TV UI where Google has had dedicated playback buttons since at least 2013.
In case the new UI hasn?ôt yet landed on your phone, chances are that you simply weren?ôt included in the control group for the test.
As with other any other Google test, there?ôs no telling whether or when the feature will roll out to the official YouTube app.

For everyone else, Google will be livestreaming the Android O reveal starting at 2:40PM EST, just a few minutes before peak eclipse time. Considering most people won?ôt be in the path of totality, Google will let you experience the eclipse in VR via Google Earth as well. You can head over to Android.com/o to find out more and watch the livestream come Monday.
As usual, Google will be naming the next version of Android after a dessert. Oreo was always the obvious choice, and rightfully so. But given the disappointment of Nougat (which should have been Nutella, of course), we?ôve been a little worried.
But Earlier today 9to5Google caught a Google+ post teasing Android O with the filename GoogleOreo_Teaser_0817_noDroids (1).mp4. The post has since been replaced with the more innocuous OctopusTeaser.mp4, but the damage was done.

581,apps,"Stock photo distributors must be squirming in fear. Researchers from Google have developed an algorithm that completely removes watermarks from images in a matter of seconds ??and it works entirely automatically.
Photography professionals will often slap watermarks on their images to protect their copyrights and prevent people from using them without their permission. However, the researchers were able to identify a glaring error in this approach and exploit it to negate the visibility of watermarks altogether.
The method ??which has been documented in more detail in a paper titled On the Effectiveness of Visible Watermarks [PDF] ??essentially takes advantage of the fact that watermarks, by design, are applied to photos in the exact same manner.
While this makes it easier for stock photography markets to establish their brand, Googlers were able to leverage this consistency in order to develop a computer algorithm that is capable of autonomously editing out signature marks out of images.
The technique is explained more extensively in the video below:

The outcome is pretty impressive. For comparison, while manually wiping watermarks from photos could take several minutes even for Photoshop pros, the researchers were able to train a model to perform the same task much quicker ??and without any intervention from humans.
The Googlers explain that the trick was to teach the computer how to accurately identify the repeating watermark structures and then fine-tune it how to replace them convincingly.
?úIf a similar watermark is embedded in many images, the watermark becomes the signal in the collection and the images become the noise, and simple image operations can be used to pull out a rough estimation of the watermark pattern,??Tali Dekel and Michael Rubinstein reveal.
Here is how this looks in action:


Fortunately for stock photo vendors, the researchers also took the initiative to come up with a more robust way to protect your photos from watermark-removing software.
The secret solution: Introducing inconsistencies to your watermark patterns.
Leaning on this method, the Googlers noticed that adding even the slightest modifications to the watermark ??like changing its position, warping its shape, and toying around with its opacity ??was already making it increasingly more difficult for the algorithm to hide the signature marks.

582,apps,"Google is trialing a lightweight Search app on Android with some users in Indonesia, that should work better than the default tool on slow mobile networks.
First spotted by Android Police, the app is currently labeled ?òexperimental??and features a search bar along with customizable shortcuts to get to various kinds of content, including news, weather, popular sites, and Google?ôs translation service.

?òSearch??works blazing fast when it comes to surfacing results, and you can use the baked-in browser, which seems to be delivering pages in Google?ôs Lite Mode to reduce load times. There?ôs even an option to switch between languages for search by simply swiping sideways on the screen.
You?ôll also find shortcuts to take you straight to different categories of content, like motoring and entertainment news; for ?òfashion??and ?òbeauty?? the app simply displays an endless stream of images, which you can share, download or follow through to the pages they?ôre from.

It?ôs an interesting move for Google, as this app appears to be more of a launchpad for all sorts of web content rather than just a search tool. It?ôs not yet clear if this will roll out globally or only be available in countries with limited connectivity; the company previously launched an app called Triangle to help Android users save data, and it looks like its new experiment is another effort in this vein to make its services accessible to people in developing countries.
You can give the app a try yourself by downloading the installer from APKMirror and sideloading it onto your device; when prompted to choose a second language, pick any one and you?ôll be on your way.

Reddit will also be rolling out a GIF-making tool that can be used in conjunction with video.
My first thought would be that this is geared towards sponsors and advertisers. Reddit already has native video advertisements, but I don?ôt see why it couldn?ôt also co-opt user vids with mid-roll or pre-roll ads. I?ôm just cynical like that.
The videos might not be available to everyone. For starters, according to Variety, moderators will have the option to not allow videos in their subreddit.

One of the more popular ways spammers trick people is by using a fake play button.

585,apps,"If you?ôve ever thrown your arms up in despair over your email inbox Newton is the app for you. The company today released its popular email app on Windows, making it available for a large portion of the business world.
Newton tries to simplify everything about interacting with email, and it mostly succeeds. It has a tiny bit of a learning curve, but this is due to its departure from the standard web-clients most of us are used to. It certainly isn?ôt difficult to navigate:
It feels like Newton is trying to make me forget it?ôs there, and that?ôs a good thing. The app is easy to navigate thanks to the minimalist design, so you can find the most interesting features right away. The ability to snooze emails, for as long as you want, is an excellent feature for people who receive a lot.
I?ôm also a huge fan of the sender profiles. Anyone who has to receive unsolicited emails will immediately benefit from this feature. Basically, clicking on the sender?ôs picture will open a card that has links to the sender?ôs LinkedIn and other relevant profiles.
 
What makes it even more valuable is that you can turn the card over by clicking in the upper right corner and you get information on the company attached to the email account.

 
The Windows version doesn?ôt have any extra bells and whistles over the iOS, Mac, or Android versions, though the sheer speed of it makes it feel native which is a plus over browser-based solutions.
It?ôs not perfect though: the app is slower to grab emails from the server than a first-layer client. My Chrome browser gives me email notifications before the Newton app can (for my Gmail account).
That?ôs what you would expect, but with all the talk of speed it?ôs important to distinguish that clicking around within the app is butter-smooth, but it interacts with servers in the same ?úkinda-slow??way as most Windows apps.
If you?ôre in the market for another email app try it; Newton has a free trial and it?ôs quite literally the easiest email app I?ôve ever set up. It was easier to sign up for than a new Gmail account. There?ôs no real reason not to give it a shot if you?ôre already frustrated with your current email app.
Well, there?ôs one reason: a lack of customization. You can change your signature, and just about everything concerning the nature of sending and receiving emails, but I couldn?ôt for-the-life-of-me figure out how to change the way the app looks. That?ôs probably not a big deal for most, but I?ôve got a ocean-wave background for my Gmail in Chrome, and I missed it while I was using Newton.
If you?ôre somewhere between ?úI need more features than the app I use now??and ?úI?ôm a corporate email server power-user with custom folder-trees??I?ôd recommend giving Newton a shot on Windows.

For those who haven?ôt been keeping up, the new design is a lot whiter, featuring colorful highlights and gradients, as well as a recurring wave motif. Feature-wise, it apes Snapchat Stories and introduces new tools like in-call image-sharing and reactions. You can read more about the changes in our post about the original mobile update here.
The desktop version includes a few new features of its own, such as the ability to @-message someone to notify them specifically during a group conversation, the ability to react to comments, and a new notifications panel. There?ôs also a chat media gallery to easily find any files or images that have previously been shared in a conversation.

If you want to try the preview, simply head on over to Microsoft?ôs Skype Insider page, register using a Microsoft account, and download the appropriate version for Mac or Windows 10.
Personally, I think the new look and approach is a much-needed improvement to the aging platform, which has been slowly losing prominence against the myriad of other chat apps. But while radical redesigns will always upset a group of users (remember Instagram?), the complaints mainly centered around missing functionality and performance bugs.
Desktop users care about functionality more than anyone, so Microsoft isn?ôt going to satisfy users until it can port all of classic Skype?ôs features to the new design.
