0,Apps,"¡°When people view VR, it¡¯s an over-sensory experience like ¡®What the fuck?!¡¯ ¡± will.i.am says, wildly spinning his head around as you can see in the GIF below. That was the Black Eyed Peas¡¯ frontman¡¯s inspiration for creating a 90-minute VR comic book that moves at your pace and lets emotion sink in instead of battering you with visuals.Today, ¡°Masters of the Sun¡± debuts at Sundance Film Festival, with the backing of Oculus, and becomes available on Gear VR headsets. While Facebook¡¯s VR division recently shut down its in-house Story Studio, Oculus has traded the heavy-handed control for a lighter touch, funding unique products it couldn¡¯t conceive itself.Masters of the Sun is part Marvel, part Dolemite, brought from augmented reality-enhanced print into VR with voices like Queen Latifah, a score by Hans Zimmer and the guidance of Stan Lee. It tells the story of regular people turned into super heroes as they try to save their community from drug-ravaged zombies¡¦ and the world from an angry alien god the Egyptians abandoned.But what¡¯s special is that Masters of the Sun isn¡¯t a video game; will.i.am insisted you not be able to shoot the zombies. And it¡¯s not a movie, racing forward no matter what direction you¡¯re looking before you¡¯ve processed the last scene. It¡¯s purposefully built as a comic book, where gazing at familiar text bubbles nudges the story forward. That way if you want to let the action or romance linger under your observation, you¡¯re in control.¡°Working with people like Hans Zimmer, we had to invent music for it,¡± will.i.am tells me. ¡°We had to have the music breathe and extend and be elastic at the speed at which the person experiences it.?We had to invent new ways of composing.¡± The concept is sure to become a building block for future VR where you control the tempo.As for the visuals, they¡¯re far from polished, looking more like a PlayStation 1 title than today¡¯s console or silver screen blockbusters. And the script haphazardly oscillates between silly and melodramatic. But the core message that love and peace can repair the world ? the same message that winds through Black Eyed Peas¡¯ music ? is deeply woven into Masters of the Sun. ¡°There¡¯s a parallel from the story to reality,¡± says BEP¡¯s apl.de.ap. ¡°All of us came from poverty, and now we have the voice and the means to help out other kids like us.¡±And because Masters of the Sun is longer than almost any piece of VR content available, akin to a feature film, you walk away feeling like you had a techno-spiritual meal, not a five-minute demo.We¡¯ve evolved beyond the ¡°train pulling into the station¡± phase of merely testing the potential of VR hardware. The narratives of stories like Masters of the Sun or Wolves in the Walls are starting to shine through. But for VR to develop into an artistic medium that compels people to buy headsets even if they¡¯re not gamers, there¡¯s more experimentation to be done.Oculus¡¯ willingness to fund big external creative projects that stray from the family friendly features like Lost, Dear Angelica and Emmy-winner Henry it¡¯s produced in past years could accelerate the ecosystem in ways its in-house Story Studio couldn¡¯t. It¡¯s fully embracing the idea that what¡¯s good for VR is good for Oculus.It has offered up the resources of a giant company like Facebook to pioneering developers like Fable and eccentric artists like will.i.am, without the regressive oversight that can reign in their vision. Masters of the Sun was basically finished when Oculus came in. ¡°We were just there to remove obstacles wherever we could,¡± says Oculus¡¯ head of experiences, Colum Slevin.The moment the Black Eyed Peas knew they¡¯d really made something successful was when the creator of most of Marvel¡¯s super heroes, Stan Lee, enjoyed it. ¡°It was the equivalent of creating an amusement park and having Walt Disney come and say ¡®this is amazing,¡¯ ¡± BEP rapper Taboo tells me.Rather than VR being just a temporary dalliance for Black Eyed Peas, work has already begun on part 2 of Masters of the Sun, as well as another property called Wizards and Robots.?¡°I think this is the ultimate art form for the next 100 years,¡± will.i.am concludes, calling it ¡°the jump off for a whole new way of telling stories, engaging people and giving them an escape.¡±Watch ¡°Masters of the Sun¡± on Gear VR via Oculus"
1,Apps,"On the heels of hitting a?1.5 million subscriber milestone and bringing on a new marketing chief, the subscription service for watching movies in theaters, MoviePass, today announced it¡¯s going to start buying movies, too. The company says it will begin to invest in films so it can share in their success beyond the box office, including on other platforms like streaming, DVD, and on-demand.At present, MoviePass is seeing rapid growth thanks to dramatic cuts to its subscription pricing, rolled out last year.Essentially, the company is subsidizing the cost of its subscription with the capital it raised from?data firm Helios and Matheson Analytics Inc. (HMNY), now its majority owner. The idea is that MoviePass will operate in the red while growing its subscriber base, and then hit some sort of break even point in terms of revenue before the funding runs out. (Or perhaps HMNY is willing to keep piling on more cash until that point arrives.)HMNY believes it will eventually be able to sell the data and insights gained from a large subscriber base to studios, who could then do targeted marketing for their films to the most active movie-goers.The model, of course, is risky. And theater owners like AMC have already?lashed out against the service claiming its low-cost tickets are devaluing the movie-going experience.But maybe MoviePass just found a sweet spot in terms of what a large number of consumers are willing to pay to actually go to the movies? After all, movie ticket prices have risen over the years, but attendance is hitting record lows. With all the other options to watch movies these days ? not to mention the ¡°peak TV¡± moment ushered in by the streaming era ? these ¡°in-the-theater-movies¡± face tough competition for consumers¡¯ time and money.Still, MoviePass believes it has the power to boost theater attendance, so it may as well share in the upside of the films to which it sends all of these customers; and that includes when those films start streaming across other platforms beyond the silver screen.The company today claimed it can boost theater attendance on demand, in fact.It says it currently buys about 3 percent of the domestic box office, but when it tweaked some things in its app ? things it only described as ¡°a series of levers within its app and marketing-based platform¡± (uh-huh) ? it could move the needle even further. It said it did this for?The Post,?Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri,?Call Me By Your Name?and?The Shape of Water. MoviePass says it impacted 10 percent of box office performance for these movies.We should note the company didn¡¯t share specific data that would allow these figures to be fact-checked more thoroughly.MoviePass is now at Sundance making the pitch that it¡¯s ready to invest in films itself.It will do so via?MoviePass Ventures, a wholly-owned subsidiary founded to co-acquire films with film distributors.Basically, the idea here is that since it can (maybe!) boost the performance of a movie in the theatrical window, that will impact the movie¡¯s ability to generate revenue downstream ? like when the digital version goes on sale, or when it starts streaming.And MoviePass wants a cut.¡°We aren¡¯t here at Sundance to compete with distributors, but rather to put skin in the game alongside them and to bring great films to the big screen across the country for our subscribers,¡± said Ted Farnsworth, CEO of Helios and Matheson Analytics Inc., in a statement. ¡°We¡¯re open for business. We¡¯re here at Sundance ? and SXSW is next.¡±"
2,Apps,"Yahoo Finance today launched a new app called Tanda that allows small groups of either five or nine people to save money together for short-term goals. The app uses the concept of a ¡°money pool¡± ? that is, everyone participating in one Tanda¡¯s collaborative savings circles will pay a fixed amount to the group¡¯s savings pot every month. And every month, one member gets to take home the full pot.But Tanda is not a gambling app. That is, users are not contributing in the hopes of ¡°winning¡± the pot of money ? everyone in the savings circle gets a chance to take home the full pot at some point.The app is based on the age-old ¡°rotating savings and credit associations¡± (ROSCA) concept, which pushes people to save through the use of collective pressure.In other words, while it¡¯s true that you could just set aside a set a fixed amount of money on your own, Tanda¡¯s makes saving a more collaborative and social construct.The other difference between saving in Tanda and saving on your own is how the app handles payouts. The first two people to receive their money pay a fee, but the last payout position receives a 2 percent cash bonus. This rewards users who are willing to wait to receive their turn at the pot, though some will want higher positions in order to get the large payout sooner.A higher position is obviously more desirable if you have a more immediate need for the funds ? like buying books for school or replacing a dead laptop, for example. Of course, you still have to pay into Tanda to take money out, so it¡¯s not a direct replacement for a credit card. But, with some planning, it could used as an alternative to charging larger purchases.As a user participates in Tanda by making contributions, their ¡°Tanda score¡± increases. With higher scores, the user gains access to higher value savings circles and earlier payout positions. These savings circles can reach up to $2,000.And if someone drops out, Tanda will step in to cover their positions.Tanda is also working with its partner Dwolla to vet users before they can begin saving, the company says. Users will be required?to submit a valid ID and have a U.S. bank account.Yahoo says that the app is designed to help individuals achieve their financial goals without racking up more debt.The company hopes this will allow Tanda to attract a millennial audience, which is already drawn to social apps in the finance space, like Venmo. In addition, this younger demographic is facing a variety of financial struggles, like higher costs of living, difficulties in finding work, and they often struggle to save on their own.¡°Thirteen months ago, a national outlet reported 46 percent of our nation can¡¯t come up with a $400 emergency expense,¡± Simon Khalaf, Head of Media Business & Products, told TechCrunch, when explaining why the company wanted to develop this app.(The figure he¡¯s citing comes from this?2016?Federal Reserve survey?of more than 5,000 Americans about their financial situation. According to its findings, approximately 46 percent of Americans said they would not be able to come up with $400 in an emergency situation.)¡°This inspired us to start building Tanda, a mobile world version of a centuries old
community savings tool that we hope provides a solution to many,¡± Khalaf explained.The new app is being released under the Yahoo Finance brand.Yahoo, like (disclosure!) TechCrunch parent company AOL, combined to form Oath, which is now owned by Verizon. But Yahoo continues to maintain its own app store presence through apps like Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Weather, Yahoo Newsroom, Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Fantasy Football, Yahoo Mail, and many others.Tanda is available today in both English and Spanish on Android, and will arrive on iOS within the next few days."
3,Apps,"In 2009, Facebook was just getting popular with moms and grandmas. People were playing Farmville. Twitter was just becoming mainstream. And Foursquare launched on to the scene.Back then, Foursquare was just another social network, letting users check in to locations they visit and potentially receive badges for those check-ins.A lot has changed since 2009, but Foursquare still remains, though not without some adversity. Today, in a review of 2017, Foursquare has announced that last year is the third year in a row in which Foursquare has seen at least 50 percent revenue growth.Foursquare¡¯s data, with over 3 billion visits/month around the globe, 105 million global venues, and 25 million people globally (both in and outside of the apps, via the Pilgrim SDK) who have opted in to always-on location sharing, is incredibly valuable to advertisers, businesses and developers. But transitioning from a consumer app to an enterprise platform ? going from an Instagram to a comScore ? has not been without its trials.In 2014, Foursquare decided to ditch its original legacy app. Instead, the company announced, it would offer check-ins and ambient location-sharing via a new app called Swarm and the new and improved Foursquare would focus solely on place recommendations, essentially turning Foursquare into a direct competitor to Yelp.The only way to viably sell data to advertisers, businesses and developers is to have your own army of hungry, active users to provide that data to begin with. And the old Foursquare was bloated and directionless, with a variety of potential uses. In short, it felt stale during a time when new apps were springing up left and right.But Foursquare knew that the data it was collecting on users would prove its value eventually. And it was able to continue convincing investors that that would be the case.While the unbundling effort was a risky bet, it seems to have paid off for the company. Both apps have over 50 million monthly active users as of 2016, which has allowed Foursquare to put their foot on the gas with enterprise products.For example, Pinpoint by Foursquare (an advertising product) now boasts more than half of the Ad Age 100 as advertisers. Attribution by Foursquare lets those brands measure how effective that advertising is. Attribution more than doubled revenue in 2017.Developer tools are also an integral part of Foursquare¡¯s business. The Pilgrim SDK and Places API ¡°grew substantially,¡± according to a post by CEO Jeff Glueck, and now provides location tech to 125K+ developers.Foursquare added 50+ new roles over 2017, including positions in engineering, sales, creative, business development, marketing, and ops. In 2018, the company is opening a new engineering office in Chicago, and plans to grow the team by 30 percent over the course of the year.It¡¯s taken nearly a decade, but Foursquare is finally proving that it can turn years of consumer data into a viable revenue stream."
4,Apps,"Apple has updated the look of its web-based App Store, 9to5Mac first reported. It definitely has the feel of the iOS 11 App Store, which Apple completely redesigned and launched last September. But, unlike iOS 11, there¡¯s no focus on app discovery.The functionality is about the same as before, but what it comes down to is the clean design that feels simpler ? perhaps due to the increased amount of white space. There¡¯s also a bit more of an emphasis on reviews.If the app is optimized for iPhone X, Apple now shows iPhone X screenshots rather than screenshots from older phone models. Oh, and now Apple reminds you that its apps are only available on the App Store for iOS devices.Let¡¯s check it out.Here¡¯s before:And here¡¯s after:"
5,Apps,"Snap Inc. has laid off at least two dozen people across several divisions within the company, according to The Information and Cheddar?which first reported the news.Snap has since confirmed these layoffs, which largely affect those on the content teams in the New York and London offices. More than half of the two dozen employees laid off today were part of the content team.Snap tells TechCrunch that what¡¯s left of the content division will now move to the company¡¯s Venice, California location and that it will?continue to hire on the content team. According? to Snap, this is just part of finding the right people for the job.These layoffs also may not have been unexpected, as they are part of a reorganization effort to cut costs due to the lackluster growth at the six-year-old company.Investors have been pressuring Snap to grow its user base, but so far the company has fumbled in key areas such as hardware and a much anticipated app redesign, which has had a delayed rollout to the United States. This redesign has worried some publishers as it may affect their traffic.Thought Snap didn¡¯t want to comment on when that redesign may arrive in the U.S., other reports pin it at the end of Q1 this year.Snap has gone through several layoffs in the last year, letting go several dozen employees over a couple of rounds in the hardware division and in recruiting in late 2017. At the time, founder Evan Spiegel announced in a letter that the company would be slowing hiring efforts in 2018 and that managers would be asked to make?¡°hard decisions¡± about teams that weren¡¯t performing well in order to get the company back on track.It remains to be seen how the new redesign will affect growth and revenue, but Snap seems committed to its content goals."
6,Apps,"Facebook Stories might feel redundant because 300 million people use its other Snapchat clones on Instagram and WhatsApp. But Facebook is convinced that the narrative, ephemeral, camera-first format is the future of sharing¡¦ and advertising. So despite criticism and a slow start for traction, Facebook is doubling down on Stories by testing the ability to create them from desktop, and a much more prominent placement for viewing Stories atop the News Feed instead of in the sidebar.¡°We are always working to ensure people can easily navigate and enjoy Facebook, regardless of how they connect,¡± a Facebook spokesperson tells me. ¡°We are testing the option to create and share Stories from Facebook on desktop and are also testing moving the Stories tray from the top right corner to above News Feed, just like on mobile.¡± Previously you could only consume Stories on web that had to be created on mobile. For now, a small percentage of users will see this new posting ability and design.Brands, Event promoters, and Group admins who manage their Facebook presence from desktop might embrace Stories more now that they can post from there, too. Collaborative Stories, where Group members and Event attendees can all contribute, are one of the most exciting opportunities for Facebook Stories.But the company has to be careful that brands don¡¯t drown out friends¡¯ Stories, but that¡¯s one of the advantages of algorithmically filtering the slideshows that disappear in 24 hours. Expect Facebook not to make the same mistake it made allowing professional publishers to overwhelm the News Feed, which it¡¯s now walking back in a massive change to its content ranking strategy.Advertisers might also be more comfortable getting aboard Stories thanks to desktop access. Digiday reports Facebook is building an augmented reality team in London to help it pitch sponsored AR filters to advertisers, similar to how Snapchat monetizes beyond injecting traditional display ads between Stories as Facebook does on Instagram.Facebook users will be able to upload photos or videos, or shoot them with their webcam to post from desktop. That could attract the monologue-style YouTube vloggers who have trained themselves to talk into their computer.By showing Stories above the News Feed instead of to the side, Facebook clearly thinks the content deserves more attention, and is even willing to push down its status update composer and News Feed posts to make room. That¡¯s a bold shift, considering Facebook hesitated until August to show Stories on desktop after their January launch and March rollout on mobile.CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that while eyeglass computers might be the future of augmented reality, Facebook won¡¯t wait for it, and the smartphone is already a capable AR device. But for Facebook to have a functioning AR strategy ? whether for keeping people coming back to play with AR face masks, watch friends jazz up their lives or giving advertisers creative tools ? it has to get people watching Stories en masse.That¡¯s why it started syncing Facebook Stories across Facebook and Messenger so posts on one show up in both. It¡¯s why it¡¯s allowing people to syndicate their Instagram Stories to Facebook Stories. It¡¯s why it¡¯s recruiting an army of outside developers to build AR tools for Story-tellers. And it¡¯s why Facebook¡¯s desktop site is now fully adopting Stories.Whether users warm up to them is another question. Facebook¡¯s social graph has bloated to include distant acquaintances and family you might not want to be able to see a raw view into your day-to-day adventures. That¡¯s the advantage of Snapchat¡¯s closer-friends network, and something Facebook may need a better privacy solution for to get people to share.But remember that people protested the News Feed when it first arrived on Facebook. And the younger generation that¡¯s addicted to Snapchat shows how users can pour a half hour a day into sending, posting and watching camera-based content. If that¡¯s any portent, Facebook might just be early to delivering mainstream users the shift from text to Stories. And if you give people a prominent space to show off for friends, vanity and narcissism may eventually compel them to fill that space with snippets of their lives."
7,Apps,"Spotify has been working on building out its podcast business, and now offers a large catalog of shows (including our own Original Content, which you should definitely check out). Today, it¡¯s debuting a new ¡°multimedia format¡± that adds visual elements to podcasts (as well as audiobooks, news bites, and other audio, but for the sake of simplicity, let¡¯s just call all that ¡®podcasts¡¯).The launch of Spotlight is going to feature stuff from Gimlet Media, Crooked Media, Cheddar, BuzzFeed News and others, and will also include original series created by Spotify itself, like RISE, Secret Genius and its Spotify Singles session series with various artists.Spotify¡¯s original content hasn¡¯t had a spectacular start out of the gate (Singles being the one exception) but this new format could be a way to help give it a boost. It could also help Spotify differentiate its podcast offering, among legacy leaders like Apple Podcasts, which still dominates in terms of overall market share.Spotlight will offer up content in playlist format, which visual elements available on devices using the Spotify app. It¡¯s a bit like the rich media MP3 podcasts that some creators take to the time to build, which have dynamically changing album artwork, as well as embedded links, chapter markers and more. These aren¡¯t supported by every podcast player, however, so it¡¯s rare that podcast producers will take the time to build them in. Spotify¡¯s Spotlights will include photos, videos, and text in addition to audio, and is rolling out to U.S. users first.This is not to be confused with ¡®Spotlight,¡¯ the Spotify feature of the same name that launched in 2013, which also used playlists but was a very different kind of thing aimed at music and artist commentary.Spotify¡¯s experiments with podcasts are interesting, but uptake and adoption will be the true test. Here¡¯s hoping they can make a real go of it, because the podcast format could do with some innovative new twists to help it reach a broader audience."
8,Apps,"Okta and fellow cloud company ServiceNow got together to build an app that helps ServiceNow customers using their security operations tools find security issues related to identity and take action immediately.The company launched the Okta Identity Cloud for Security Operations app today. It¡¯s available in the ServiceNow app store and has been designed for customers who are using both toolsets. When a customer downloads and installs the app, it adds a layer of identity information inside the ServiceNow security operations interface, giving the operations team access to information about who specifically is involved with a security problem without having to exit their tool to find the information.Okta is a cloud identity management company, while ServiceNow is a cloud service management company. ServiceNow approached Okta about this integration because research has shown that the vast majority of breaches are related to compromised user credentials. The sooner the security operations team can track down the source of those credentials, the sooner they can begin resolving situation.The way it works is a company detects a breach through the ServiceNow security tool. Instead of searching logs and taking days or weeks to find the source of the breach, security operations can see the problem user directly in the ServiceNow interface.With that information, they can decide immediately how to mitigate the issue. That could involve forcing the person to log out of all their applications and logging back in with new credentials and two-factor identification, suspending the user for 24 hours or a number of other actions at the discretion of the security personnel.Okta identity tools in the ServiceNow interface. Screenshot: ServiceNowThe combination of the two products results in a better solution for customers who are using both tools anyway, says Okta COO and co-founder Frederic Kerrest. ¡°It reduces incident triage, improves risk scoring and accelerates containment,¡± he explained.The integration takes advantage of the Okta Advanced Integration Network and involves a set of APIs for inserting Okta functionality inside of other applications. Among the other companies Okta is working with on this kind of integration is Palo Alto Networks.This is not the first time the two companies have worked together, says Kerrest. There have been a couple of other cases where ServiceNow has used Okta as the default identity management solution in their products."

Craigslist has been a leader in online rentals, but not everyone is satisfied with the user experience.Apartment List?is one of the many sites vying to stand out in the crowded rental marketplace. And it¡¯s raising another $50 million in capital, which should help. Passport Capital, Canaan Partners and Industry Ventures all participated. The startup has raised a total of $110 million since 2011.Co-founder and CEO John Kobs said that despite the competitive landscape which includes Zillow, HotPads and PadMapper, he believes Apartment List has a business model that¡¯s different. It only collects payment from listings that actually result in a transaction.¡°We¡¯re the only company that gets paid exclusively for success,¡± said Kobs. He said that this helps prevent scammers.Rich Boyle, general partner at Canaan Partners said that others in the space have been charging ¡°regardless of propensity to close or the fit with a given property, which was unsatisfactory to all and wasted a lot of time and money on both sides.¡± He says that the current Apartment List model has resulted in a business that¡¯s ¡°scaling very, very quickly.¡±Kobs says that their most successful communities are Denver, Dallas, D.C. and other ¡°demand-constrained markets.¡± Apartment List aims to help landlords find renters in competitive regions.Consumers also have a different experience on the Apartment List platform.

11,Apps,"Instagram now lets some users slap background-less GIFs sourced from Giphy onto their Instagram Stories. Rolling out for wider testing with a Giphy-branded design, the new GIF sticker engine could further differentiate Instagram Stories from Snapchat, which has yet to embrace the animation GIF trend.It appears that Giphy has worked with Instagram to create a special search engine for a library of GIFs designed to be overlaid over photos and videos rather than being shared by themselves. The backgrounds and transparent bits of these GIFs have been cut out so they mesh into your imagery.Instagram¡¯s new transparent GIF search engine, powered by GiphyFacebook and Giphy have been working more closely recently on custom GIF databases, as the two built a child-safe, hand-picked set of animations to offer in the new Messenger Kids app for users younger than 13 years old. Previously, Giphy helped Facebook launch a GIF comment button.Instagram¡¯s initial tests of GIF sharing were first reported by The Next Web in November, but details were scarce and the product didn¡¯t have a ¡°Giphy¡± logo in the search bar. Now more users in the Philippines and Brazil are getting access. The screenshots above come from Brazilian social media consultant Mika Mota.Instagram was abnormally cagey about discussing the feature, maybe because a partnered announcement with Giphy is looming. After an initial ¡°no comment¡± though, an Instagram spokesperson told me ¡°we¡¯re always testing new experiences for the Instagram community.¡± Giphy didn¡¯t respond to a request for comment before press time.Instagram has become a hub for home-made animation sharing thanks to its popular Boomerang feature that started as a standalone app before getting baked into Stories. Recently, Instagram added some savvy stabilization, which makes your back-and-forth image loops much less shaky. And Facebook?has tested its own Boomerang-style GIF creation button.But now Instagram appears ready to open up to outside GIF engines to expand its sticker library. Instagram already offers a few props like sunglasses and mustaches, seasonal imagery, standard emoji, location and weather overlays, time stamps, selfie stickers and augmented reality face masks. If it wants Stories to stay interesting, though, it has to keep equipping users with new ways to jazz up their posts. Working with a third-party like Giphy that in turn aggregates content from user submissions could bring an endless parade of adornments to Instagram Stories.While Snapchat offers animated filters, augmented reality World Lenses, and?Bitmoji, it still doesn¡¯t offer a GIF or Boomerang-like sharing experience for Stories. You might say that keeps its Stories authentic, but for kids around the world sitting in their unexciting bedrooms, it might leave what they share looking a bit boring.[Update: Snapchat recently added its own animated stickers, but they come as pretty limited rotating sets rather than a big, third-party powered library.] Back in April we wrote that Snapchat¡¯s anti-developer attitude was limiting its potential. By December, it finally relaxed its iron grip over the experience by starting to let developers build their own AR filters, though Snap won¡¯t help promote them unless they pay.Facebook¡¯s decade-old platform and culture of working with outside developers could help keep its products fresh at a time when it¡¯s desperate to encourage sharing. The company announced a retreat from public publisher content in the News Feed in hopes of promoting well-being through active interaction between friends instead of passive consumption. One way to fuel that drive is by giving people ways to creatively communicate visually without having to paint a masterpiece by themselves."
12,Apps,"Facebook¡¯s turning its push for well-being through active, not passive, content consumption into a feature with its new test of ¡°Watch Party¡±. It allows Group admins to pick any public video on Facebook and show it to their members at the same time with a dedicated comment reel to create a ¡°shared viewing experience¡±.Live videos on Facebook generate six times more discussion, and Watch Party could bring that to recorded videos, but with a more intimate vibe since your comments won¡¯t get lost in an raging river of discourse. Previously, commenting on a public video felt like trying to yell into an infinitely loud public square. Watch Party could make people feel heard, making Facebook a better second-screen. Facebook¡¯s head of video Fidji Simo says that ¡°Watching, commenting and reacting to the same moments together . . . helps build the kind of community and engagement we¡¯ve seen with Live.¡±You¡¯ll see a box in Groups where you can tune into Watch Party and see a queue of what¡¯s slated to be broadcast next, though there¡¯s no way for admins to schedule a Watch Party in the future. While you view, comments roll in overlaid on mobile like with Live, or in the sidebar on desktop. You can also pitch in Facebook¡¯s emoji Reactions for an easy way to participate without typing.The idea isn¡¯t far from what former Facebook president Sean Parker tried with the relaunch of his flopped startup Airtime. Except instead of trying to get you to start a social graph and group chats from scratch, Watch Party piggybacks on Facebook¡¯s existing billion-user Groups feature. The closest thing Facebook had to built to this before was screensharing in its Workplace chat product.Sean Parker¡¯s Airtime wanted you to watch videos together with small chat groups of friends but never took off¡°When done well, video brings us closer together¡± CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on Facebook¡¯s Q3 earnings call. ¡°We¡¯ve found that communities formed around video like TV shows or sports create a greater sense of belonging than many other kinds of communities . . . But too often right now, watching video is just a passive consumption experience.¡± That¡¯s in part why Facebook recently announced a massive overhaul to the News Feed that will see it show fewer videos and public publisher content in favor of friends and stories that get you to comment.¡°Time spent is not a goal by itself. We want the time people spend on Facebook to encourage meaningful social interactions¡± Zuckerberg said. ¡°So we¡¯re going to focus our products on all the ways to build community around the video that people share and watch. That¡¯s something Facebook can uniquely do.¡±Co-watching video is already a popular experience online through platforms like Twitch, but they often center around the video¡¯s creator rather than an interconnected community. Watch Party could refocus this experience towards peer-to-peer interaction rather than everyone screaming through the comments trying to get the creator¡¯s attention. It might also give an engagement boost to Facebook¡¯s new original video content hub Watch, though the new feature isn¡¯t limited to these longer-form shows.Simo says Watch Party will first open to a ¡°handful of Groups¡±, but it¡¯s looking to expand soon. Facebook recently launched a whole Creator app for social media stars that I bet will increasingly integrate with the fan groups that spring up around them, which would be perfect for Watch Party,And it would make a ton of sense for Facebook to bring this feature to Group chats next. While it might be fun to co-view a cooking show with a big foodies group, or a political debate with Pantsuit Nation, the people I really want to laugh and joke with in the comments are my closest friends."
13,Apps,"Amazon has quietly launched a new feature that¡¯s seemingly aimed at helping the retailer better compete with discount shopping apps such as Wish and others. In the Amazon mobile app and on the web, Amazon recently added a new section offering products under $10 that ship for free. Some of the products are also available on Prime, but the feature doesn¡¯t appear to be limited to Prime subscribers.The retailer didn¡¯t officially announce the addition beyond a brief sentence in the ¡°What¡¯s New¡± section of its app store update text.Called ¡°$10 & Under,¡± the selection can be found under ¡°All Programs¡± in the Amazon¡¯s app main navigation. This is the area where Amazon regularly trials its newer experiments, like its shoppable Instagram clone Spark or outfit compare feature, for example.The discount store is also?available?here on Amazon¡¯s website.The new section organizes low-cost products by category, including by Women¡¯s, Men¡¯s, Electronics, Gifts, Home D?cor, Household, and Watches.There¡¯s also a category called ¡°Hello 2018!¡± which is New Year¡¯s themed ? that is, it has products that could be used for New Year¡¯s Resolutions, like gym workout clothes, as well as some items for New Year¡¯s parties. (This section should probably be updated now! We do understand that the goal is to have ¡°seasonally relevant¡± merchandise going forward.)Or you can view ¡°All¡± products, which is the default selection if you don¡¯t scroll over to see the various categories.As you browse the selections, you never reach the bottom of the page ? the site endlessly scrolls, similar to Amazon¡¯s curated gift shop, Interesting Finds,?which has a similar look-and-feel with its top-level categories and thumbnail images.Of course, items under $10 are not likely to be of the highest quality, but there¡¯s definitely a market for these sort of cheap (and often direct-to-consumer by way of China) products. In consumers¡¯ minds, the thought, generally, is that the purchase is worth the risk ? even if it doesn¡¯t work out, you¡¯re only out a few dollars. But if it does work, you¡¯ll end up with something halfway decent for very cheap.Plus, there are plenty of things consumers want to buy that don¡¯t need to be high-end purchases ? like iPhone cases, costume jewelry, socks, headbands, selfie sticks, and more.Wish, in particular, has capitalized on this shopping trend with an app that today offers over 300 million items for ¡°thrifty¡± shoppers from thousands of merchants.In fact, Wish¡¯s app became the number one shopping app in the U.S. in 2017, in terms of downloads across the iOS App Store and Google Play combined, according to data from App Annie, Sensor Tower, and Apptopia.Sensor Tower says?Wish was ahead of Amazon for the year, with 32.5 million U.S. downloads compared to Amazon¡¯s 29.2 million.App Annie noted Wish¡¯s #1 ranking was largely driven by the Google Play downloads, which does point to a certain kind of discount shopper interest ? iOS users spend more than their Android counterparts, that is.Wish was also #5 by monthly active users in App Annie¡¯s analysis from November 2017 (part of the holiday shopping season), compared with Amazon at #1.This trend toward low-cost shopping outside of Amazon doesn¡¯t just include Wish, of course ?? consumers are also heading to Amazon rival Walmart, AliExpress or even secondhand apps like letgo, OfferUp, Mercari, and others, in order to save.This is likely of concern to Amazon, and potentially a key reason why it may have launched this ¡°Under $10¡± shopping feature.However, the app has another benefit for Amazon, we understand. It¡¯s also designed to increase visibility for products in Amazon FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon)¡¯s Small and Light Program. Businesses that participate in Small and Light can make their products Prime-eligible.¡°Amazon is always innovating on behalf of customers and ¡®$10 and Under¡¯ is our newest means of delighting customers who love a great value,¡± a company spokesperson told TechCrunch. ¡°¡®¡®$10 and Under¡¯ helps customers explore the breadth of low-priced products available on Amazon.¡±You can try the ¡°Under $10¡± store online or on iOS or Android.Correction: This article has been updated to note the feature is also available on Android, not just iOS, as the update text on the App Store had stated.?"
14,Apps,"Global app downloads topped 175 billion and consumer spending exceeded $86 billion in 2017, thanks to growth in emerging markets including China, India, Brazil and Russia, according to a new report from App Annie out this morning. Notably, India has now become the number two country by downloads, passing the U.S., which is now third. China has long since been in the lead.The difference between the total downloads App Annie is reporting (175b) and the 91.5 billion recently reported by the firm Sensor Tower in its own year-end wrap-up can be attributed to how the data was gathered. Sensor Tower¡¯s figures are drawn from the iOS App Store and Google Play. App Annie, however, also includes third-party Android stores in its analysis ? that¡¯s how it has visibility into China, where Google Play doesn¡¯t have a presence.India becoming the second largest country in terms of downloads is a significant change in the worldwide app market over this past year.Downloads grew 215 percent over the past two years in the country, compared with 125 percent growth in China, and negative 5 percent growth in the U.S.?App Annie notes that app usage in India was driver by the introduction of subsidised, unlimited 4G access by Jio in September 2016, which has allowed users to come online in large numbers.Although the U.S. has now become a more mature market, App Annie says there¡¯s still a significant volume of absolute downloads here, as well.For example, the firm found that U.S. users downloaded 3 apps per month, and at least 70 percent downloaded at least one. It¡¯s worth pointing out that this stands in contradiction to earlier data from comScore which has continually reported that the majority of U.S. users?don¡¯t download any apps per month.Related to this, App Annie claims that users aren¡¯t just downloading apps ? they¡¯re engaging at record levels, too. In most markets, the average smartphone user has more than 80 apps on their phone, and uses close to 40 of them per month (or between one-third and one-half of the apps on their phone per month, on average).In addition, consumers are spending nearly 3 hours in apps per day on average, and the markets analyzed (see below) have averaged nearly 30 percent growth in average daily time spent since 2015.In a number of markets, including the U.S., Brazil, Russia, and others (see below), smartphone users spent 7x more time in mobile apps than on the mobile web, and access them 13x more often.While India has surged in terms of downloads as more users come online, those figures don¡¯t necessarily translate into revenues. Instead, the U.S. remains the number two market by gross consumer spend, behind China but still ahead of India.Consumer spend in app stores ? including the iOS App Store, Google Play and third-party Android stores ? has more than doubled over the past two years, to top $86 billion by the end of 2017. The top markets by consumer spend have all seen double-digit percentage growth during this time, with China in the lead (+270%), followed by the U.S. (+75%), India (+60%), Brazil (+80%) and Russia (+35%).The app market will continue to grow next year, as well. App Annie¡¯s recent 2018 forecast pegged consumer spending worldwide to top $110 billion in 2018.The new report also delves into app categories that did well in 2017, including finance/fintech, retail, video streaming, travel/ride-sharing, gaming, and social, and it spends some time analyzes China¡¯s market in particular. You can request the full report here on App Annie¡¯s site."
15,Apps,"Want a way to workout and earn some coin? Sweatcoin has risen to the top of the App Store for helping folks get something more than just a glow for taking those daily steps.The startup says it has accumulated more than 5 million users in the past year and increased revenue by 266 percent in the last quarter. There are more than 2 million weekly active users on the app, and growing, making it one of the fastest-growing fitness apps in the App Store and second to the top in the free apps, next only to the Google Arts & Culture app that blew up over the weekend.It works like this: users sign up and then hook up their smartphone¡¯s health and fitness data and GPS location to the app. The app then tracks how many steps you take in a day and rewards you a monetary ¡°sweat¡± value according to your movements. For every 1,000 steps recorded, the app will pay out .95 in ¡°sweatcoins.¡± Users can later trade these coins in for fitness gear, workout classes, gift cards and a number of other offerings.The app says you can only earn these coins by walking outside so it theoretically doesn¡¯t count if you are walking on a treadmill at the gym, though the app on my phone seems to count steps inside my apartment, as well. That¡¯s at least something.Note: I¡¯m in my third trimester of pregnancy so I¡¯m not exactly going the distance (just walking up the stairs feels like I¡¯m trying to climb Mount Everest some days). That makes it a bit hard to earn my coins ? I¡¯ve only earned .33 in sweatcoins today, for instance, so don¡¯t feel badly if you aren¡¯t hitting that 10,000 step stride.Another reason you may hit a wall of motivation in the app is that the free version limits you in how many coins you can earn a day to just five. However, you can earn more if you¡¯re willing to fork over some of those sweatcoins per month to get you in the upper tiers and make some real sweaty moolah toward that coveted Fitbit or whatever fitness gear you¡¯ve got your eye on.The startup has now raised its own coin to the tune of $5.7 million in seed from Goodwater Capital, which led the round, Greylock, which participated through its Discovery Fund, Rubylight, Seedcamp and SmartHub, as well as a number of angels, including Justin Kan and Rain Lohmus.Sweatcoin founders say they plan to use the funding to expand outside of the U.S. and U.K. markets to other English-speaking countries, then on to?continental Europe and Asia.Co-founder?Anton Derlyatka also told TechCrunch he¡¯d like to ¡°even include the ability to pay taxes with sweatcoin¡± in the future. Other co-founder?Oleg Fomenko also mentioned plans to develop an ¡°open-source blockchain DLT technology that will allow Sweatcoin to be traded like any other major crypto- or fiat currency.¡±¡°We are out to fundamentally change the value ascribed to health and fitness and provide the motivation for people to lead better lives,¡± Fomenko said.Those interested in checking out the app can download it on either iOS or on Google Play and start earning their sweat equity today."
16,Apps,"Content, as they say, is king ? but these days, that may be true only for as long as you can figure out a good business model to deliver it. And today, a startup based out of Toronto, Canada is re-upping its coffers to fill out its ambition to do just that.Wattpad, a storytelling and reading/viewing app that combines crowdsourced content with professionally produced material, has picked up another $51 million?(C$61.25 million) in venture funding ? money that it plans to use to invest in its tech (such as the machine learning that helps match its creators with consumers, and which identifies stories that are ¡®trending¡¯ and worth revisiting for more creative writing and video shooting around them as themes); and in its expansion into more formats.The company has raised?$117.8 million (US) to date,?and while it¡¯s not publicly disclosing its valuation, according to PitchBook?(which I¡¯ve found is very reliable), post-money it is valued at just under $398 million.¡°Entertainment is in a period of disruption, and how people find and experience stories is evolving,¡±?Allen Lau, the CEO who co-founded the company with Ivan Yuen, said in a statement. ¡°With our global community of users, hundreds of millions of stories and data-driven approach to helping people and partners find great content, Wattpad is leading both sides of this equation. We empower diverse storytellers all over the world, helping them build a community of passionate readers; at the same time, we also connect?Hollywood?with stories that have massive built-in audiences.¡±Last year, the company added video (a crowded market, considering the huge elephant called YouTube in the room), and a paid subscription tier, and today said that it¡¯s keen to do more across the board, in TV, film, digital media and publishing.So far, Wattpad has proven out its model in the form of user growth. Its community grew over 40 percent in 2017, it said, and now has 65 million users globally with story uploads now at 400 million.Notably, it appears that a lot of that growth continues to come from Asia, judging by the investors in this round.It includes?Tencent?(owner of WeChat and a big investor in Snapchat and generally a huge player in digital media in China);?Kickstart Ventures, which is part of Globe Telecom out of the Philippines (where Wattpad has been popular for years); and the Peterson Group out of Hong Kong.¡°Wattpad has built a creative community for storytellers and story lovers,¡± said?Martin Lau, President of?Tencent?Holdings Limited, in a statement (no relation between the two Lau¡¯s, it seems). ¡°The company is providing opportunities to new and established writers, transforming how entertainment is discovered and produced. We are glad to support Wattpad, a leader in digitizing and data enhancing the entertainment industry.¡±Others include BDC (the Canadian government¡¯s bank dedicated to funding and promoting Canadian businesses at home and especially abroad), Peterson Group, and existing investor Raine, the London-based firm that has invested in other digital media firms like Vice and Soundcloud, and also has ties to Asia, in that it advised Japan¡¯s Softbank on its acquisition of Sprint. Previous investors also include Union Square Ventures, Khosla, AME Cloud Ventures, August Capital and others.While one side of Wattpad¡¯s business is based on work that people upload to the platform, it¡¯s also tied in with a few big names both in terms of sourcing material and then subsequent distribution both in print and in video. Back in 2007 when it was just starting out, it inked a deal to distribute 17,000 titles on mobile from the Project Gutenberg; and it partnerships with NBCUniversal¡¯s?Universal Cable Productions (UCP), eOne and CW Seed. Other publisher partners include HarperCollins, Hachette Audio and Hachette Romans.It will be interesting to see how Wattpad continues to build out the business longer term. There have been a number of companies in the wider media space that have reached lofty valuations on big hopes of disrupting the world by mixing in tech alongside compelling content; but some of that has not quite played out how founders and investors have expected.The key thing here, it seems, is the audience of creators and consumers willing to use its platform to connect with each other, and the attractiveness (to investors) of that relationship and the platform that encourages it.¡°Wattpad has developed something truly special: a community that cares deeply about stories of authentic human experiences, a technology platform that unlocks the universal desire to share those stories and connect with other people, and a data set that enhances the value of these shared stories for writers and readers alike,¡± said?Minette Navarrete, President, Kickstart Ventures, in a statement. ¡°We¡¯re proud to join Wattpad as an investor, helping expand its vision to entertain and connect the world through stories.¡±¡°Wattpad is the future of entertainment,¡± added?Peter Misek of?BDC. ¡°By harnessing the power of verticalized data and AI, Wattpad has unlocked the true value of content creation, enabling discovery, production and distribution in exponentially new ways. The future can be found on Wattpad.¡±We¡¯re hoping to speak with Wattpad¡¯s CEO Allen Lau later and will update this post as and when we do with any more insights."
17,Apps,"China¡¯s Didi Chuxing unveiled its bike-sharing platform today and, as expected, it looks like a very aggressive move to protect its position.When Didi first announced its plans to offer rides from Ofo and Bluegogo inside its app, I argued that this was far from a positive gesture since?the ultimate goal is control.By introducing its own service inside its own app to its own (massive) userbase, Didi aims to tame the two companies. It wants them to exist as features inside its app, rather develop popular and independent services that could challenge Didi¡¯s dominance. Offering their services unbranded inside the Didi app gives users less reason to open, or even install,?any bike-sharing app.That¡¯s exactly what has happened, as this screenshot tweeted by Tech In Asia reporter Eva Xiao illustrates.Didi¡¯s in-app bike sharing option totally obscures Ofo And Bluegogo branding (they¡¯re the only two services that have integrated for now). They¡¯re all Didi bikes now ? pic.twitter.com/umgR3cT1jV? Eva Xiao (@evawxiao) January 17, 2018The situation might sound absurd since Didi claims an incredible 450 million users, it has billions of dollars in the bank and is China¡¯s dominant ride-sharing service by some margin after it consumed Uber¡¯s China business. But bike-sharing startups do pose a very real threat.Already, Ofo and arch rival Mobike have chipped away at Didi¡¯s share of short journeys and struck deals with local governments with the aim of solving congestion problems. Now,?they are looking to expand beyond that. Mobike, for example, has tested ride-sharing services. Mobike and Ofo both claim over 100 million registered users, so action is best taken sooner rather than later. The question is whether Didi¡¯s move is too late.This devilish strategy works because Ofo and Bluegogo have no choice but to be a part of the platform due to their ties with Didi. Ofo counts Didi as an investor and is already integrated into its app, while?Didi swooped in to save Bluegogo after it went broke. It¡¯s no surprise that Mobike, the other bike-sharing unicorn which no Didi connection, didn¡¯t elect to be a part of the program.Didi didn¡¯t make mention of this in its announcement. Instead senior VP Fu Qiang said the new service would ¡°upgrade its short-trip mobility strategy and provide various mobility options and better travel experiences for travelers on the ¡®last three kilometers.'¡±¡°This illustrates DiDi¡¯s efforts to continuously improve our one-stop transportation platform,¡± Fu added.Didi drove Uber out of China, and now it is showing it can be ruthless even to one of its own flock."
18,Apps,"Swedish startup Natural Cycles, which offers an app-based product which it bills as a ¡®digital contraceptive¡¯, has been reported to Sweden¡¯s Medical Products Agency (MPA) by a local hospital after it recorded 37 unwanted pregnancies among women who said they had been using the app as their contraception method.The women¡¯s clinic of S?dersjukhuset, in Stockholm, told us that it wants the MPA to investigate how the app functions.¡°We want the Swedish Medicines Agency to gather information about side effects, such as unwanted pregnancies, and look at how the app works,¡± said Lena Marions, a senior doctor at the clinic and associate professor in obstetrics and gynaecology.¡°The midwives of our abortion reception found that there were many women who were unwanted pregnant and who stated that they used this app¡¦ Since September 2017, they noted how many women there were and then reported the number to the Swedish Medicines Agency.¡±¡°We always report to the Medical Products Agency if we perceive that a medical product or drug is not working as it is intended to be done,¡± she added in the emailed statement, also noting that the?clinic has previously reported other unwanted pregnancies to the MPA ? in that instance related to women who had used an IUS (hormonal coil) as their contraceptive method.A spokesperson for the MPA confirmed it is looking into the complaints, telling us it has received ¡°approximately 50 complaints¡± related to unwanted pregnancies in users of Natural Cycles¡¯ device.¡°The investigation is still in an early phase. The MPA has requested the manufacturer to submit vigilance reports?within two weeks,¡± the spokesperson added, suggesting it¡¯s not yet clear whether or not it will initiate a full investigation.Responding to the complaint, Natural Cycles provided us with the following statement:No contraception is 100% effective, and unwanted pregnancies is an unfortunate risk with any contraception. Natural Cycles has a Pearl Index of 7, which means it is 93% effective at typical use, which we also communicate. Our studies have repeatedly shown that our app provides a high level of effectiveness similar to other methods.It also said it has not yet received any information from the clinic, saying it ¡°cannot comment on specifics¡±, adding: ¡°We are however in touch with the MPA and are responding to each individual reported case.¡°At first sight, the numbers mentioned in the media are not surprising given the popularity of the app and in line with our efficacy rates. We have initiated an internal investigation with our clinical department in order to confirm this.¡°As our user base increases, so will the amount of unintended pregnancies coming from Natural Cycles app users, which is an inevitable reality.¡±Natural Cycles¡¯ subscription product relies on an algorithmic method to predict which days women are fertile during their monthly cycle ? with an in-app color-coded calendar informing users if they could have unprotected sex on a given day or not.Women using the app are required to measure and input their body temperature daily using a basal thermometer. Natural Cycles relies on this and other individual data inputs to algorithmically calculate the probability of the user being fertile on each day in her cycle.As noted above, the company claims its product has an efficacy rate of 93 per cent with ¡°typical use¡± ? although this figure is based on a self-selecting study of its own users. As we have previously reported, Natural Cycles has not carried out a randomized control trial which would provide a higher standard of proof to back up its efficacy claims.Nor has it carried out any comparative studies of its method against other contraceptives such as the pill or condom use. So it¡¯s still not possible for users of the product to judge how effective Natural Cycles¡¯ system is vs more established contraceptives methods ? though co-founder Dr Elina Berglund told us last fall that it hopes to conduct such a study against condom use in future.Last November, when Natural Cycles announced its?$30M Series B, Berglund also reported the app having 500,000+ users across ~160 countries, telling us its home market of Sweden remains its largest market, followed by the UK and the US, where she suggested it was seeing sharp growth.Asked to break out active usage in Sweden now the company declined to specify an exact number ? saying only that it¡¯s ¡°one of our largest¡±.Natural Cycles¡¯ business gained a big regional boost in February 2017 when its product gained certification in the European Union as a contraceptive method.It has also applied to the FDA for certification in the US, though the assessment process for accreditation there is different and remains ongoing at this stage, with no guarantees it will be granted.As well as being criticized for loudly marketing efficacy claims that are only based on a self-selecting study,?Natural Cycles¡¯ product has attracted criticism because it requires couples to remember to use an alternative contraception method if they have sex on days when the app informs them there¡¯s a risk of pregnancy ? with some women¡¯s health experts warning of the relative complexity of this approach.¡°It requires that the user follow the instructions very carefully and protects with condom when the woman is fertile. I think you should be aware of that when using it,¡± noted Marions. ¡°The app is better suited for those women who may think of getting pregnant, or older women who are less fertile.¡±¡°There are several good contraceptives that provide good protection, such as spirals and p-rods. But there is no contraception that protects one hundred percent from pregnancy. It is always the woman who will choose what suits her body and lifestyle,¡± she added.Responding to this critique, Natural Cycles said it agrees its product is better suited to older users, and further noted: ¡°You have to be over 18 to use Natural Cycles. The average Natural Cycles user is 30 years and less than 1% are under 20.¡±When we asked who Natural Cycles users were back in November, Dr Berglund also told us: ¡°Most women are between 25 and 35, they¡¯re in a stable relationship, they¡¯re often thinking about that they want to have children in a few years and they don¡¯t want to take hormones anymore.¡±It does also?emphasizes the choice point, saying its goal is ¡°to increase contraceptive choice so that all women find a suitable method of contraception¡±.¡°Today there is a big trend for women to move away from hormonal contraception, and Natural Cycles can provide a helpful option for these women. We therefore expect, in fact, overall to decrease the unwanted pregnancy rates because we¡¯re increasing contraceptive choice, and see that many of our users are women who have not used any type of contraception before,¡± it added."
19,Apps,"How do you compete with the world¡¯s largest chat app in its strongest market?Hike, the Indian messaging app valued at more than $1 billion, is taking a unique approach to battling WhatsApp which involves dismantling its service, layering it on budget Android phones and offering free connectivity.The company, which is backed by the likes of Tencent and Foxconn, today unveiled ¡®Total, built by Hike¡¯ ? a new service aimed at reaching novice smartphone owners and first-time internet users in India.Hike is in the unenviable position of competing squarely with WhatsApp, the world¡¯s most popular chat app, which counts India as its largest single market with over 200 million active users. For perspective: that¡¯s two-thirds of India¡¯s internet using public. By contrast, Hike said it had collected 100 million registered users in January 2016, but there¡¯s been no further update since then.CEO?Kavin Bharti Mittal plays down the competition ? WhatsApp ¡°doesn¡¯t have to lose¡± for Hike to succeed, he said ? but with Total, Hike is being more nimble that its Facebook-owned rival and redesigning itself to offer a different kind of experience to reach new internet users before WhatsApp gets them.The most notable part of Total is that it runs without a data connection.That¡¯s important,?Bharti Mittal told TechCrunch, because Hike has noticed a general slowdown in internet adoption growth in India. Last year¡¯s launch of Reliance Jio, which offered free data packages for a time, took the number of Indians online to around 300 million, but Bharti Mittal believes the number is ¡°stuck¡± due to factors like price and the challenge of just setting up a phone.¡°It¡¯s a?15-20 step process [to step up a smartphone] and that¡¯s complicated for a first time mobile user,¡± he explained in an interview. ¡°Combined with pricing, that makes it very scary.¡±Total, then, is Hike¡¯s effort to make things easier. The startup?teamed up with mobile carriers and OEMs for Total, with device makers bundling a tweaked version of Android that makes Hike the default text/call app and loads features like Hike¡¯s wallet, cricket news and horoscopes. The registration process is now down to under five steps, too.The?piece de resistance is ¡®data without data.¡¯Owners of Total-powered devices can get online without a data plan thanks to an adaptation of?USSD, a technology that is typically used to send basic information to devices like balance checking.Hike said it developed a proprietary system that, with approval from carriers, allows USSD to be used for basic internet access.?Supplied for free, it allows a range of Hike services to operate on a device when it is offline.Total unbundles and pre-installs eight Hike services that operate without a data connectionIt isn¡¯t fast ? TechCrunch was shown a demo during a video conference call ? but it¡¯s enough to operate Hike messaging, Hike wallet and the unbundled features like real-time cricket scores. Like Internet.org, Facebook¡¯s free internet system that was deemed unconstitutional in India, Hike gives a taste of internet to users in the hope that they will want more. Internet.org ? later renamed Facebook Basics ? came unstuck by constructing a walled garden internet but Hike isn¡¯t altering Google Play, so any apps, including WhatsApp, can be installed.There are some limits around usage though.?Specific features ? such as sending or receiving photos in chat ? require a data package, and Hike has negotiated with carriers to offer tariffs as low as 1 INR (less than $0.02). The payment is made over the device¡¯s Hike Wallet, which connects to a bank account using the Indian government¡¯s UPI tech.¡°Our goal is still to bring one billion people online. The Total connection is pretty good but it is not the internet, we want people to come on to rich services,¡±?Bharti Mittal explained.Initial partners include operators?Total. Airtel, Aircel and BSNL ? which cover around 40 percent of India¡¯s market ? while four smartphones from Indian OEMs Intex and Karbonn due to launch March 1. They will be priced from 3,500 INR ($55),?Bharti Mittal said.¡°These are starting partners and?our hope is that, as we make more progress, we can get more partners,¡± the Hike CEO said.Financially, Hike is paying the OEMs to pre-bundle Total. Bharti Mittal didn¡¯t comment on its agreement with carriers but you¡¯d imagine there is a revenue-share agreement for each data pack or upgrade sold.No doubt, Hike¡¯s proposition is seen as a low-risk opportunity for India¡¯s carriers, who are still reeling from the emergence of Reliance Jio, which is funded by India¡¯s richest man. The upstart telco is said to have picked up 140 million subscribers by standing out. It launched its own-brand phones and?has even been linked with releasing a cryptocurrency such is its determination to disrupt the status quo in India¡¯s telecoms market.Hike isn¡¯t just looking at India for Total, however. Bharti Mittal estimated that the program has a two-year window of potential domestically, but, as Indian consumers become tech-savvy and increasingly use data plans, it will look at overseas opportunities.¡°There are many markets out in the world where this technology could be equally as prevalent,¡± he said, hinting that Africa and neighboring countries could be expansion targets.Hike isn¡¯t alone at addressing India¡¯s future internet users. Google has released a range of data-friendly apps for those on spotty connections and limited smartphones, while its public WiFi program ? which covers national train stations ? has received impressive reviews."

It¡¯s free to join, although a premium version of the Curve card is also available for ?50 that offers additional perks.A quick reminder of the Curve proposition: Like a plethora of fintech startups, Curve is building an app that essentially turns your mobile phone into a financial control center to help you manage ¡°all things money.¡±But rather than building, say, a new current account or a personal financial manager that scrapes data from your existing bank accounts ? as is the case with the challenger banks such as Monzo and Starling, or chatbots Cleo and Plum, respectively ? the startup¡¯s ¡°attack vector¡± (as Monzo¡¯s Tom Blomfield calls each fintech¡¯s entrance point) is a card and app that lets you connect all your other debit and credit cards so you only ever have to carry a single card.Once you¡¯ve added your cards to Curve, you use the Curve app to switch which underlying debit or credit cards you wish the Curve MasterCard to spend from, and track and see a single and consolidated view of your spending regardless of which card was charged.Additional functionality includes being able to lock your Curve card at a touch of a button, instant spend notifications, cheaper FX fees than your bank typically charges when spending abroad or in a foreign currency and the ability to switch payment sources retroactively.The latter is dubbed ¡°Go Back in Time¡± and means if you make a purchase via Curve that gets charged to a card other than you intended, you have two weeks to change your mind (see our coverage on the feature to see why this is clever and useful).More broadly, Bialick says Curve¡¯s consumer launch represents a further step toward the startup¡¯s vision for fintech convergence. The bet that the Curve founder made when he started the company in 2015 was that whenever there¡¯s disruption ? in this case, following technological and regulatory changes, a plethora of new fintech companies are unbundling various parts of the banking sector ? this inevitably leads to fragmentation. What then eventually follows is convergence. Curve, like other fintechs, is seeking to fill that void with a platform that re-bundles various financial products but in a way that puts the consumer in control.We can already see evidence of how this is playing out with Curve¡¯s single view of your spending and the way the platform is entirely agnostic to where your money is stored. Bialick is pretty fond of saying that banks do a good job of looking after your money (just as well,?as Santander Ventures is a recent backer ? more on that below) and that nobody needs to become a bank in order to provide a financial control center and nobody needs to switch banks to access one.He also believes that by offering a Curve MasterCard (a standard that is pretty much accepted everywhere and supports contactless, chip and PIN, magstripe and ATM withdrawals) that re-routes all of your spending through Curve, it has other advantages over being asked to switch banks. That¡¯s because, argues Bialick, a sprawling fintech and financial services landscape means that we have more bank accounts and cards than ever, and while account aggregation isn¡¯t new or unique (indeed, HSBC¡¯s new Beta banking app lets you pull in transaction data from external bank accounts), on its own it doesn¡¯t solve fragmentation at the point of payment.For example, I have two current accounts with incumbent banks, a credit card, and more recently TransferWise¡¯s multi-currency account and debit card. Three of those are already plugged into my Curve card and there is nothing stopping me from adding the likes of Revolut, Monzo, Starling or Tandem¡¯s credit card, too. (Noteworthy, both TransferWise founder Taavet Hinrikus and Tandem founder Ricky Knox have invested in Curve).Bialick also tells me that Curve, like just about every other fintech, plans to take advantage of Open Banking/PSD2, recent legislation in the U.K./Europe that makes it a requirement for banks to let third-party apps access a customer¡¯s transaction data and make payments on their behalf (with permission, of course). Once this is added, probably much later in the year, Curve will be able to track all your spending, not just card transactions, giving it a much fuller picture of your financial life.The plan then is to put that spending data to better use on your behalf through the Curve Connect platform, a kind of curated app store for financial and other related products. The idea is that Curve will connect to the best financial services, including fintechs, but also from major banks, to help you get more from your money.It¡¯s similar, in varying degrees, to the vision of Starling¡¯s marketplace banking, Monzo¡¯s upcoming curated partnerships or N26¡¯s growing number of integrations. Then there are a long list of Personal Finance Manager apps, chatbots or even fintech startups like Bud, which is helping incumbent banks offer their own fintech marketplaces powered by your transaction data. And that¡¯s before the likes of Amazon, Google, Apple or Facebook make their first move into Open Banking, something that the banks fear as much as any fintech.To that end, Bialick says that, although being able to see all of your spending in a single place is useful, many people actually find viewing their transactions and balance quite stressful. What they really want are better tools that put them in control and help with the management of their money, meaning that they need to worry about their finances less.Meanwhile, I¡¯m hearing that Curve is working on a partnership with multinational bank Santander (which, as noted, is a backer of Curve through Santander Ventures). This, if my sources are correct, will see a co-branded version of Curve offered to Santander customers within a couple of the regions it operates. I also understand the startup is gearing up for further fundraising in the form of a sizeable Series B later this year."
21,Apps,"Last spring, YouTube rolled out a massive update to its desktop site that included a redesign, faster underlying framework, and the addition of a dark mode. Now, that dark theme may be making its way to the YouTube mobile app, as well.The change was recently spotted by MacRumors (by way of Reddit), and is already appearing for some users of the most recent version (13.0.1) of the YouTube mobile app.It¡¯s not clear at this point which YouTube users have already received the dark mode option, though a number of commenters on the original Reddit posting chimed in to say that they¡¯ve just received the new setting, too, along with the original poster.If available, you¡¯d find the option to turn on dark mode ? called ¡°Dark Theme¡± ? in the YouTube app¡¯s Settings screen, just above the Restricted Mode setting.One Redditor claimed they were able to force the Dark Theme to appear by force-closing the app, then relaunching it. However, it could have been a coincidence that the setting appeared after they took that step ? it didn¡¯t work in our tests, we should note.Another said they didn¡¯t receive the option in Settings, but were rather prompted to try the dark mode via a pop up message that appeared.Dark Theme screenshot, via Reddit user OustedHoChiMinhWhile a relatively minor tweak, a dark mode has been among the top requests from YouTube users for a variety of reasons, beyond it just looking cool. When staring at a screen for long periods of time, dark mode can be easier on the eyes, for starters, and it allows users to better focus on the content itself, not the various controls and other navigational elements. Some tests have also shown dark modes to save on battery life. That¡¯s useful, given that over half of YouTube¡¯s views come from mobile, and users are spending more than an hour per day watching videos on mobile devices.At the time YouTube originally launched the Dark Theme on desktop, the company wouldn¡¯t confirm if it would port the theme to other devices, including mobile. Instead, YouTube said that it would track usage of the Dark Theme to see if the feature was widely adopted before determining if it made sense to roll out further.Even if the Dark Theme on mobile is just a test at this time, it does at least indicate that YouTube saw enough traction on desktop to warrant trialing the option on mobile.If YouTube were to launch a dark mode on mobile, it wouldn¡¯t be the only app do so. Twitter also has a dark mode available, as do other apps like podcast player Overcast, Reddit client Apollo, and Twitter client Twitterific.YouTube hasn¡¯t yet responded to requests for comment on the appearance of Dark Theme, but we¡¯ll update if we hear back."
22,Apps,"The app economy is continuing to grow, with the worldwide revenue from app stores expected to top $110 billion this year, according to recent estimates from App Annie. However, the time people spend using their apps is starting to stagnate, another report has found. In Flurry¡¯s ¡°State of Mobile 2017¡± annual wrap-up, the firm reported that overall app session activity only grew 6 percent from 2016 to 2017.That¡¯s down from the 11 percent growth it reported at year-end 2016, and represents users spending an average of more than five hours per day on smartphones.The declining growth in session activity means users are reaching a point where they can¡¯t give up much more time out of their day to using apps. Instead, they¡¯re shifting activity from older apps to newer ones. They¡¯re spending time across a diverse variety of apps, too.There are some clear winners and losers in terms of app usage growth over the past year.Not surprisingly, this has been the year for e-commerce to boom. Usage of shopping apps was up 54 percent from 2016 to 2017, Flurry found, now that consumers are comfortable making purchases paying on mobile devices. App integrations with Apple Pay and Samsung Pay have also helped.We saw this trend play out in particular during the holiday shopping season where mobile shopping was set to pass desktop for the first time, for example, and where $2 billion of Black Friday¡¯s $5.03 billion in online sales took place on mobile.Another big winner in 2017 was the Media, Music and Entertainment category, which saw 43 percent year-over-year growth in app usage as consumers increased their media consumption on mobile.This was also evidenced in a recent year-end report from Sensor Tower, which found that Netflix¡¯s app generated the most revenue of any non-game app during 2017 ? a position that Pandora had won for a quarter previously before being beat out for the overall top spot by Netflix.App categories with declining in 2017 included Lifestyle and, surprisingly Gaming.To be clear we¡¯re talking about declines in app sessions¡¯ growth, not declines in app usage here. It¡¯s a metric that points to a larger trend related to apps¡¯ usage and popularity, but not one that should worry developers and publishers just yet. After all, as Flurry points out, gamers today are spending more time and money in mobile games than ever before.Lifestyle apps saw the largest decline in growth, down 40 percent year-over-year. This indicates the app category as a whole could be struggling to build daily usage habits, Flurry suggests.To generate this report, Flurry tracked more than one million applications, across 2.6 billion devices globally in 2017. It defines app usage as a user opening an app and recording a session.The full also report delves into other areas of mobile usage, including form factor adoption and top mobile manufacturers. Here it found that phablets are still heavily used, accounting for 55 percent?of active devices.Meanwhile,?Android manufacturers made up two-thirds of all active devices in 2017, but Apple dominated individual market share with 34 percent of all active devices.* Disclosure: Flurry shares a parent company with TechCrunch (Oath) by way of its 2014 acquisition by Yahoo. TC parent AOL merged with Yahoo to form Oath in 2017. Verizon owns Oath.?"
23,Apps,"Uber has confirmed it will cap the amount of hours drivers on its platform in the UK can be logged in to accept trips. After ten hours the new policy will require drivers take an uninterrupted six-hour break before they can log back into the app again.Uber says the new UK driver hours policy will come into force next week.A spokesman told us it¡¯s making the change to ¡°enhance driver and passenger safety¡± ? though in truth the company has faced rising political pressure on safety issues and working conditions for many months now, including facing a grilling in October from a parliamentary committee that¡¯s running an enquiry into the gig economy.Safety was also one of the issues cited by London¡¯s transport regulator for withdrawing Uber¡¯s license to operate in the city in?September.In a statement on the new driver hours policy, Andrew Byrne, Uber¡¯s head of policy, told us: ¡°While drivers only spend an average of 30 hours a week logged into our app, we want to do our part to ensure they don¡¯t drive tired. That¡¯s why we¡¯ve been sending drivers regular reminders to take rest breaks and why we¡¯re now bringing in these new limits.¡±¡°We continue to listen to feedback and plan to make other changes and improvements over the coming months,¡± he added.An Uber spokesman declined to answer when we asked whether the company will be bringing in driver caps elsewhere in Europe.Back in October?Uber told UK MPs running an enquiry into gig economy working conditions that it was working on a mechanism to cap the amount of time a driver could be logged into the app over a rolling 24 hour period.?At the time it said it was testing a cap of between 12 and 10 hours.During the committee session UK parliamentarians pressed Uber on its attitude to safety ? raising concerns about the long hours being clocked up by drivers on the platform, including citing stories of drivers sleeping in their cars to work for longer.Uber told the committee that the average number of hours worked per week by Uber drivers across the UK is ¡°just under 30¡È. It also said a quarter of Uber drivers work fewer than 10 hours per week; another quarter works more than 40 hours; and ¡°about 25 per cent¡± work more than 40 hours per week.Though it has since corrected these figures ? saying that the median number of hours is 30; and that 16 per cent of drivers in the UK are logged into the app for fewer than 10 hours per week; and just under a third (31%) are logged in to the app for more than 40 hours per week.The committee asked Uber to send breakdowns for percentages of drivers working more than 50, 60, 70 and 80 hours per week ? and Uber initially told it ¡°fewer than 6% of drivers spend more than 60 hours logged into the app per week¡±.Again, Uber has since corrected the figures it provided ? and in a letter to the committee dated December 13 it now states that ¡°fewer than 8% of drivers spend more than 60 hours logged in to the app per week¡±.It also said that 2.6% of Uber drivers are logged in for more than 70 hours per week, and 0.8% are logged in for more than 80 hours per week.Given that the company claims to have around 50,000 drivers on its UK platform that suggests up to 4,000 Uber driver?are routinely logged into the app for more than 60 hours per week. Of those, 1,300 are logged in for more than 70 hours per week, and 400 are logged in for more than 80 hours per week.Though in the letter Uber claims that ¡°an hour logged into the Uber app is not the same as an hour of work¡± ? suggesting for example that ¡°drivers can log in while on a break or doing other things¡±.From next week, those 4,000 UK Uber drivers will face a hard cap of ten hours on the number of consecutive hours they can be logged in to ply their driving trade on the platform.But the fact it¡¯s taken legal challenges and public pressure from parliamentarians to push Uber to install a safety cap on driver working hours hardly reflects well on the company¡¯s attitude to driver and passenger safety.Rising legal and political pressure is clearly having an impact on how Uber does business in Europe though.?In?November?the company lost its first appeal against a 2016 UK employment tribunal verdict that had judged a group of Uber drivers to be workers, rather than self-employed contractors ? as the company had argued.Last April, in the wake of the October 2016 tribunal decision, it announced it was launching a subsidized personal injury and illness insurance product for drivers in the UK ? responding to rising legal liabilities related to working conditions on its platform.Uber has said that if it has to fund workers¡¯ rights for all ~50k UK Uber drivers it would cost the business ¡°tens of millions¡± of pounds. (Though, in?December, it announced that from January it would fund a free personal accident and sickness insurance package for all couriers on its UberEats business, across Europe.)The UK government has been actively eyeing how gig economy platforms mesh with current employment ? commissioning an?independent review?into the issue which reported last summer. Though it¡¯s still not clear how exactly it might move forward with legislative changes.Responding to Uber¡¯s new driver hours policy, the IWGB union, which campaigns for gig economy workers rights in the UK, welcomed the cap but argued that it fails to address?the root cause of driver fatigue ? which it says is a result of low rates of pay (it claims UK Uber drivers need to work for 34 hours a week just to break even).¡°If?Uber?forces drivers to work less without paying more it is just going depress hourly earnings even further below the minimum wage and push drivers to the brink. The solution is simple:?Uber?has to abide by what two separate tribunals have ruled and pay its drivers at least the minimum wage and holiday pay,¡± said IWGB UPHD branch chair James Farrar in a statement.¡°[Transport for London] and licensing authorities around the country have also contributed to the problem of driver fatigue and exploitation by over supplying the market with licenses and failing to make provision to protect drivers. Once again, drivers are being made to pay for the consequences of corporate greed and regulatory failure.¡±"
24,Apps,"¡°The app became too cluttered,¡± Facebook¡¯s head of Messenger David Marcus announced today in a post of plans for 2018 including ¡°massively simplifying and streamlining Messenger this year.¡± Between Messenger Day/Stories, its Snapchatty augmented reality camera, a bot Discover section, games, and more, Facebook had to build artificial intelligence ¡°M Suggestions¡± just to remind people of all the features it has crammed in the app.Marcus (pictured, right) is right ? Messenger has strayed from its value of being an easy way to chat with people across devices without their phone numbers.So in a wise move similar to Facebook¡¯s recent retreat from news and public content with its big algorithm overhaul, Messenger plans to consolidate around its core.¡°Over the last two years, we built a lot of capabilities to find the features that continue to set us apart. A lot of them have found their product market fit; some haven¡¯t,¡± Marcus admits.Here¡¯s just some of the feature creep that¡¯s invaded Messenger since 2016 without making the experience better day-to-day for its 1.3 billion users:The streamlining is smart, given that Messenger has become the center of many people¡¯s Facebook experience as sharing and browsing increasingly shifts to Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, and other apps.Messenger should concentrate on communication. It doesn¡¯t have to abandon everything else, but content broadcasting like Stories shouldn¡¯t literally be highlighted above our message threads.And areas like games and bots don¡¯t necessarily need whole tabs that could be used for more ways to actually get together offline or hang out online with your friends.From the rest of Marcus¡¯ announcement, though, it seems like some of the least liked features won¡¯t be disappearing. Here¡¯s the rest of his ¡°trends¡± for Messenger in 2018, which are vague, so I¡¯ve added some hunches about how they¡¯ll turn emerge in the product:From that it sounds like Messenger might become part of Facebook¡¯s Safety Check in a more private and personal way. That could hopefully improve on the current system of prompting users to broadcast on Facebook that they¡¯re okay, which can make friends worry that anyone who hasn¡¯t posted might not be. I suspect that Facebook¡¯s instant split-screen group video chat Bonfire, which mimics teen app Houseparty, could go from a standalone app testing in a few countries to being baked more directly into Messenger in some form.?Perhaps an even bigger opportunity would be a Down To Lunch-style product for helping find out which of your friends are available to hang out offline, not just chat.¡°Visual messaging . . .?is where the industry is heading, and we won¡¯t be looking back,¡± Marcus writes. But perhaps Messenger could focus more on back-and-forth visual messaging over broadcast, and make Stories more a piece of your message threads rather than bolted to the top of the app.Perhaps Messenger could let you call or text for customer service, for when talking is actually easier than typing. Beyond that, better messaging tools could lead to wider adoption for businesses.This sounds like an expansion of Messenger ads to a more self-serve format like the Messenger Broadcast tool we reported it¡¯s prototyped.How Facebook will actually balance a simplification of its app with all these new things it wants to add will be quite a tightrope to walk.If it annoys users too much, and even a few of their friends stray from the app and stop responding on Messenger, it could create a downward spiral. But with iMessage also becoming bloated, Snapchat¡¯s growth slowing down, and Google¡¯s messaging apps a mess, Facebook is still best-poised to rule chat."
25,Apps,"Earlier this month, I wrote that crypto companies are going to become investors in 2018. I didn¡¯t quite imagine that happening as quickly as mid-January, but here we are. Ripple, the fintech startup behind the controversial XRP token, has its first investment after it backed U.S.-based storage startup Omni through a $25 million round.Omni was founded in 2015?as a storage option for those with limited space at home ? ideal for the Bay Area where it is based ? and this year it began to allow people to rent their stored items out to others.That isn¡¯t exactly an obviously match for Ripple ? which helps?banks use the blockchain via software services ??but that hasn¡¯t stopped the company from striking a undisclosed ¡°business deal¡± with Omni. Ripple didn¡¯t invest directly in this round, to be clear ? instead executives Stefan Thomas (CTO) and Chris Larsen (executive chairman and co-founder) took part alongside existing Omni investor?Highland Capital Partners. Thomas and Larsen invested via an undisclosed amount of XRP for the round, which Omni said closed in December.The funds will go towards a second city expansion in the second half of this year and hiring. ¡°This funding is another step we¡¯re taking to make our vision a global reality,¡± CEO Thomas McLeod said.Omni had raised $14.75 million in traditional investment to date. It isn¡¯t exactly clear why the startup has gone down the crypto route at this stage but you¡¯d imagine that the Ripple deal is strategic in nature.Unfortunately, imagine is all we can do since neither company is being forthcoming with details.Omni said it is ¡°not disclosing at this time¡± the exact details of its alliance with Ripple.A spokesperson declined to comment when TechCrunch asked whether Omni plans to hold an ICO. (XRP is a token that could be swapped for an ICO coin.)The spokesperson also declined to comment when asked if Omni has plans to use XRP within its service.¡°Omni is creating a way to move physical goods frictionlessly from one person to another. In many ways, it¡¯s similar to what we¡¯re doing at Ripple for global money transfers, where we want money to move as fast ? and frictionlessly ? as information,¡± Thomas, the Ripple CTO, said in a prepared statement.¡°This is a first-of-its-kind deal which alters the traditional funding landscape, and we¡¯re excited to be a part of it,¡± added Highland Capital Partners¡¯?Manish Patel.Ripple announced an incentives program last October which pledged to disburse $300 million in XRP to financial institutions that use the token.?The value of XRP has increased over five-fold since then, giving Ripple an even more powerful war chest. It doesn¡¯t have a specific program for developers or startups yet, Ripple¡¯s global head of infrastructure innovation told TechCrunch in a recent interview.A system may not be in place but this deal shows that Ripple is actively sizing up potential partners outside of the financial world.The move to invest crypto in startups makes plenty of sense when you consider that companies which have raised large ICOs are typically flushed with (digital) cash and keen to develop ecosystems around their technology. Putting money to work through investment in startups with synergies?is already standard for companies like Slack, Google and Amazon, so why not apply it to the crypto world, too.A more valid question, perhaps, is why Ripple is making friends outside of the core banking audience that it draws its revenue from?Today¡¯s announcement comes the week after Ripple announced a tie-in with cross-border payment service MoneyGram. MoneyGram, which was subject to a failed acquisition by Alibaba¡¯s Ant Financial unit, said it has agreed to pilot XRP within its payment flows using Ripple¡¯s xRapid product.Ripple has attracted criticism?for misleading partnerships with financial organizations, which has seen XRP¡¯s valuation soar. It reached a record-high of $3.65 per coin earlier this month which briefly made it the world¡¯s two largest cryptocurrency based on total coin market cap. That price represented a?huge surge from $0.006687 one year prior.A recent New York Times article published?explained that more than 100 banks use Ripple¡¯s software, but MoneyGram and?Mexican money transfer business Cuallix are its sole XRP customers. Financial industry sources cited by the Times expressed skepticism that any banks would adopt XRP.Ripple¡¯s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, refuted those claims?and claimed?new customer wins would be announced soon.Disclosure: The author owns small amounts of cryptocurrency"
26,Apps,"WhatsApp appears to be testing a new feature aimed at trying to limit the spread of chain letter style spam messages and tackle viral fakes spreading on its platform.Two WhatsApp blog sites, Whatsappen.nl and WABetaInfo, report spotting notification messages in the app which appear intended to warns users that they are at risk of forwarding some spam ? by displaying a notice that the message ¡°has been forwarded many times¡±.A similar warning is also shown displayed on a frequently forwarded message when it¡¯s received, although the feature is described as still in development and it¡¯s not clear whether WhatsApp intends to officially roll it out or not (WhatsApp owner Facebook frequently experiments with feature tweaks on its messaging products, especially in international markets; and ? safe to say ? not all its tests end up officially baked into the product).At the time of writing the company had not responded to our requests for confirmation that it¡¯s testing the anti-spam feature.?Update:?A WhatsApp spokesman declined to comment.Chain letter messages that contain ? at best ? nonsense claims, and which urge other WhatApp users to forward the message to all their contacts to keep amplifying the spread are a staple sight on the platform (and indeed also on Facebook where users can get asked to copy-paste and repost a spam status message to spread it).Such as the below example ? which was circulating on the WhatsApp of a UK TechCrunch editor¡¯s child ? which creatively reimagines the CEO of the company as an individual called ¡®Jim Balsamic¡¯¡¦While these sorts of chain letters might seem like a pretty trivial form of fake news to worry about, the problem of false rumors spreading like lightning across WhatsApp¡¯s platform has been linked to far more serious consequences.In India, for example, fake rumors have reportedly triggered?mob attacks that resulted in deaths and injuries.Religious and caste tensions in India and Burma have also been stoked by fake posts spread via social media, as the?Washington Post?reported recently.Other fake rumors spread via WhatsApp apparently thwarted a local government immunization drive.Last year Facebook took out full page adverts in Indian newspapers telling people how to spot fake news (something it also did in Europe ahead of elections).The problem is the people most likely to be convinced by false information are unlikely to be the same people buying and reading newspapers.So stepping up technical anti-spam measures on its platforms to try to slow the spread of viral fakes seems like the responsible thing for the company to do given the very real risks attached to how its technology is accelerating misinformation."
27,Apps,"Airbnb has today announced a new feature that will help users manage their payments on the platform. The feature, aptly albeit unimaginatively named Pay Less Up Front, lets users pay for a part of their trip upon booking and the rest near the time of check-in.Before now, Airbnb users had to pay 100 percent of their booking up front. For weekend trips, that wasn¡¯t such a big deal. But long stays can end up being relatively expensive and thus inconvenient to pay for up-front.This comes on the heels of another payments feature that lets group travelers split payments at the time of booking.Airbnb said that, during testing of the Pay Less Up Front feature, 40 percent of guests chose to go with that option and chose higher-value bookings. The company also said that users who chose to use the feature booked with 2x the lead time compared to ordinary bookings.Airbnb determines the amount that can be paid up front and the amount that is due a few days before check-in, which the company says is usually 50 percent. One stipulation of the feature is that bookings must be made 14 days ahead of check-in and must be at least $250 total.The new feature is available now across all platforms."
28,Apps,"We have even more information about messaging app Telegram¡¯s plans for cashing in on its popularity within the crypto community with the massive ICO for its proposed Telegram Open Network (TON) project (that we first reported),?after obtaining the whitepaper and investor prospectuses in full.From the documents, it is clear that Telegram isn¡¯t content with sitting on a platform like Ethereum for its token sale and services, as most ICOs are. Instead, it wants to create a platform of its own to rival Ethereum for hosting a new wave of decentralized services and internet experiences tipped to emerge thanks to the blockchain.Telegram¡¯s ICO will be a record if all goes according to plan, but that¡¯s only the start.The company plans to raise a staggering $1.2 billion in total, starting with?a $600 million pre-sale that¡¯s strictly?for traditional venture capital backers and those inside its executive¡¯s close circles.?That first stage is running from January to February by invite-only, according to the letters sent to selected participants that were viewed by TechCrunch.Following the pre-sale, the firm plans to hold a public sale in March which will allow retail investors to enter. The public sale is pegged at $600 million, which would make the overall ICO worth $1.2 billion. That blows any other token sale out of the water, and it would easily surpass the current record of $257 million raised by Filecoin in September.Beyond money, the ICO will be notable for a product with far greater traction among consumers than any other token sale project to date. As explained in the prospectus, Telegram is on track to surpass 200 million active users this year:In October 2017, Telegram reached 170 million monthly users, delivering 70 billion messages every day. At least 500000 new users join Telegram daily. At this rate, the service is expected to hit 200 million monthly users in Q1 2018. These users can provide the required critical mass to push cryptocurrencies towards widespread adoptionTelegram is best known for a messaging app, which the company claims in the documents is used for community communication in over 60 percent of ICO projects, but its own ICO is more extensive than monetizing that chat service.The company is planning to develop the building blocks for a decentralized internet that could eventually power decentralized apps (known as DApps), smart contacts, censorship-proof websites and more.The pitch includes four components, as we previously reported:Putting these components together could allow Telegram to be the base for a new range of decentralized apps and services based on the blockchain. It could turn Telegram from a messaging app into a platform that hosts internet-based content which could, in theory, operate micro-paywalls that let users unlock news or subscriptions for small amounts of crypto payment, while there¡¯s also the potential to become a major payment hub.TON will provide the backbone for new kinds of internet services while also allowing existing social networks and messaging apps to join in, too.Telegram said its services play, which lets other developers build apps and services on top of TON,?can ¡°be a gateway to blockchain-based projects for the masses ? similar to how Google Play and the App Store currently work for centralized applications.¡±All of these goals, of course, require technology and?Telegram¡¯s 132-page whitepaper goes into much detail on that. Those technologies outlined in the whitepaper aren¡¯t deployed by other projects right now, so they will require some time for development, but they are based on, or inspired by, ongoing efforts from other blockchain companies that remain in progress.Blockchain developers who spoke to TechCrunch were underwhelmed by the lack of new technology in the whitepaper, claiming that it mostly uses theories from existing projects rather than pushing the envelope.More details in full, as we reported last week:The ¡°TON Blockchain¡± will consist of a master chain and 2-to-the-power-of-92 accompanying blockchains. Its most notable aspect is that it will have an ¡°Infinite Sharding Paradigm¡± to achieve scalability. Thus, TON blockchains aim to be able to ¡°automatically split and merge to accommodate changes in load¡±. This would mean new blocks are generated quickly and ¡°the absence of long queues helps keep transaction costs low, even if some of the services using the platform become massively popular¡±.It will also consist of ¡°Instant Hypercube Routing¡± designed so the blockchain can maintain top speed even as it grows. Its proof of stake approach will reach consensus through a variant of the ¡®Byzantine Fault Tolerant¡¯ protocol, again increasing speed and efficiency. And it will also use 2-D Distributed Ledgers. This means the TON can grow new valid blocks on top of any blocks that were proven to be incorrect to avoid any unnecessary forks. In other words, TON aims to be ¡®self-healing¡¯.TON¡¯s third generation blockchain will be based on a dynamic ¡®proof of stake¡¯ secured by multiple parties with a high degree of fault tolerance. It will also handle storage of ID, payments and smart contracts. So, instead of relying on proof of work to create its currency, Telegram will rely on a new, less energy-hogging way of mining cryptocurrency than the original Bitcoin method.The claim is that it will be capable of a vastly superior number of transactions, around 1 million per second. In other words, similar to the ambitions of the Polkadot project out of Berlin ? but with an installed base of 180 million people. This makes it an ¡®interchain¡¯ with so-called ¡®dynamic sharding¡¯.Telegram CEO Pavel Durov speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt San FranciscoOnce news of the project got out, most interest focused around the token sale itself with many investors sure the project will be a hit based on hype alone.For the sale itself,?Telegram is proposing to create five billion Gram tokens ? which it plans to use the ??symbol for ? to be distributed as follows:A recent trend in ICOs, also known as token sales, is to offer large discounts in the pre-sale phase to encourage large investors ? known as Whales ? to contribute. Telegram is requiring a minimum investment of $20 million for that ? a number that is way higher than any other token sale to date ? with discounts of more than 50 percent for those who take part. According to a document for investors, Telegram believes the pre-sale discount could exceed 70 percent of the final token price although the final numbers aren¡¯t confirmed. That is insane.With the final public sale price targeted at $0.97, that could mean some whales pay as little as $0.31, according to the prospectus.Due to those enormous discounts, Telegram is proposing a varied lock-up period that would see the investors who enjoyed the largest discount unable to sell their tokens. Details are still being worked out, but lock-up periods could range from three to 18 months dependent on discount, with an option for partial lock-up, too.There will be an uncharacteristically long delay before investors, both pre- and public, get their hands on their tokens. Telegram plans to release the Grams in December, with a schedule of January-March 2019 for when they will list on exchanges, thereby becoming available for everyone else and, crucially for investors, tradable.Plenty of ICOs are rightly accused of trading on hype and developing multi-billion dollar market caps for their coins without actually offering a product.Telegram¡¯s token sale will take place before the company¡¯s product is available, but the tokens themselves will be released after a number of features according to the company¡¯s rough guideline as shared with investors:By 2021, Telegram plans to step back and rename TON to ON with the network managed by its foundation. That¡¯s not an entirely uncommon goal for token sale projects.¡°Telegram will serve as a launch pad for TON, ensuring its technological superiority and widespread adoption on the initial stages, but the future of TON is in the hands of the global open-source community,¡± the company wrote in the whitepaper.There¡¯s a lot to unpack from the Telegram ICO, but it is clear that early reports of plans to develop its service into WeChat undersold the sheer ambition of this project.Acutely aware of the unique position that their company occupies as the go-to app for the crypto community, Telegram¡¯s founders are aiming to develop a platform of comparable scale to Ethereum and the many ¡°Ethereum killers¡± that have launched over the past year or so. This ICO isn¡¯t just designed to (finally) make money from the Telegram messaging app, it aims to build a platform for future ICOs, future cryptocurrencies, future decentralized applications and a new kind of censorship-proof internet system.The question ? like all ICOs ? is whether the theory can become reality. Certainly on the tech-side, Telegram¡¯s processes and protocols remain in development. The product roadmap reflects that and the big launches won¡¯t happen until later this year (the Telegram wallet) and early 2019, when the TON-based economy goes live, which means there are no major clues as to when the public component of the token sale opens.Given the fact that few ICOs even have a product in the market, let alone one with 170 million active users, you can expect that crypto-focused investors will be keen to grab a slice of this sale. How the pre-sale fares among more traditional VCs will also be one to watch.Disclosure: The author owns small amounts of cryptocurrency including ETH."

31,Apps,"Netflix was the top earning app of 2017 that wasn¡¯t a mobile game, according to Sensor Tower¡¯s new year-end report on the most successful apps and publishers across Apple¡¯s App Store and Google Play. In previous years, the top spot had gone to Spotify, and before that, LINE. But this was Netflix¡¯s year to shine. The service saw gross subscriber revenue of approximately $510 million ? a 138 percent increase over last year ? per the firm¡¯s estimates. That¡¯s about 2.4 times the $215 million users spent in the Netflix app in 2016.It¡¯s not surprising to see Netflix snagging this top-grossing position. The app has been at the top of the revenue charts at various points throughout 2017. For example, in Q2 Sensor Tower had reported?the app saw 233 percent revenue growth year-over-year to $153 million, which was then up from the $46 million it had seen at the same time last year.At the time, Netflix was reporting a surge in international subscribers, which were accounting for the majority of its new signups. These new users are often joining Netflix through their phone and paying through in-app purchases.By its Q3 2017 earnings reported in October, Netflix had gone on to beat its own expectations for subscriber growth, again thanks to its adoption in international markets.?Of the 5.3 million new subscribers in the quarter, 850,000 came from the U.S. while 4.45 million came from international markets.The Netflix app was also the top earner across all of Apple¡¯s App Store. But on Google Play, it ranked below Tiner, Google Drive, LINE, Pandora, and HBO NOW.Another notable app success last year was Tencent Video. In 2016, it was the #14 top grossing app (non-game) by revenue on the App Store alone. This past year, it jumped up to #3 by revenue on the App Store, and #5 in overall revenue across both stores. (If Google Play was available in China, things would probably look a lot different, too.)In terms of downloads, however, the top app list was dominated by Facebook.This year, Facebook¡¯s main app lost the number one spot to WhatsApp as it sank to #3. Messenger and Instagram followed, and Snapchat was in fifth place.?Sensor Tower¡¯s report analyzed mobile games separately.Mixi¡¯s Monster Strike was the top grossing mobile game in 2017 ? a position it¡¯s now held for three years in a row.?Tencent¡¯s Honor of Kings earned second place, but again, because Google Play isn¡¯t in China.The games list is interesting for other reasons, as well. The one-time hit Pok?mon Go didn¡¯t make the top 10, but five year-old Candy Crush Saga did (#5). That goes to show that even though games is largely a hits-based business, it¡¯s possible to have staying power in the market, too.Tencent¡¯s success in gaming and with Tencent Video also helped it become the top mobile publisher for both game and non-game revenue in 2017.Image credits, including charts: Sensor TowerUpdated, 1/12/17, 9 PM ET to show Facebook as #3 in non-game overall downloads due to an error on Sensor Tower¡¯s original graph, now replaced.?"
32,Apps,"Confusingly jamming Stories in between private messages has sparked backlash amongst the first users of Snapchat¡¯s sweeping redesign. In the few countries including the U.K., Australia, and Canada where the redesign is widely available, 83 percent of App Store reviews (1,941) for the update are negative with one or two stars, according to data provided to TechCrunch by mobile analytics firm Sensor Tower. Just 17 percent, or 391 of the reviews, give it three to five stars.The most referenced keywords in the negative reviews include ¡°new update¡±, ¡°Stories¡±, and ¡°please fix¡±. Meanwhile, Snapchat¡¯s Support Twitter account has been busy replying to people who hate the update and are asking to uninstall it, noting ¡°It¡¯s not possible to revert to a previous version of Snapchat¡±, and trying to explain where Stories are to confused users.It¡¯s not possible to revert to a previous version of Snapchat, but we are happy to help with any questions you may have about thenew layout.? Snapchat Support (@snapchatsupport) January 11, 2018Hopes were that the redesign could boost Snapchat¡¯s soggy revenue, which fell short of Wall Street earnings expectations in Q3 and led to a loss of $443 million. The redesign mixes Stories, where Snapchat shows ads but which have seen stagnation in sharing rates amidst competition from Instagram Stories, into the more popular messaging inbox, where Snapchat¡¯s ephemeral messaging is more differentiated and entrenched.Screenshots of Snapchats redesign?A recent leak of Snapchat¡¯s user stats published by The Daily Beast¡¯s Taylor Lorenz shows that from late-April to mid-September, Snapchat saw zero growth in the number of users posting Stories. That¡¯s compared to the roughly 7 percent growth in the app¡¯s total user base, which was already seen as disappointing for what¡¯s supposed to be the hot teen social app.Daily Snaps sent grew much faster with users sending an average of 34 Snaps per day, which is much more promising. But it¡¯s hard to monetize messages with ads without feeling interruptive, so Snap¡¯s strategy appears to be mixing ad-laden Stories into the inbox. And users are rebelling.Story sharing has stopped growing¡¦¡¦But users keep sending more messages so Snap started mixing them all togetherSnapchat smartly began algorithmically sorting Stories to show ones from your favorite people and closest friends first, instead of ranking them purely reverse chronologically. TechCrunch strongly advocated for this algorithmic sorting back in April, as a similar move proved to significantly boost engagement for Twitter and Instagram by making it easier to quickly get value out of opening the app.But what seems to annoying users is that Stories from friends who follow you back are now scattered through the inbox with message threads in between, rather than all laid out together. Snapchat also pulled out Stories from social media stars, brands, and other people who don¡¯t follow you back and pushed them into the other side of the app alongside professional Discover content. For users who enjoy a more voyeuristic experience, or aren¡¯t popular at their school, that could make it difficult to know who has posted a Story in the last 24 hours.Sorry to hear you feel this way.

Snapchat Support (@snapchatsupport) January 11, 2018Snapchat¡¯s redesign also prevents users from auto-advancing to lay back and watch lots of people¡¯s Stories in a row. Instead it forces users to tap a preview of the next person¡¯s Story before it¡¯s shown.While that might ensure you don¡¯t watch anyone¡¯s Story you don¡¯t care about and end up in their view list, it also makes the app much less relaxing to watch for long periods like you can with Instagram¡¯s auto-advancing Stories. Perhaps Snapchat wanted to ensure you were still looking so it can sell advertisers on the concept of undivided attention. But it¡¯s further pissing off users.Snaps, Chats, and Stories from friends who¡¯ve added you back are on the Friends screen.

It jumbles existing functionality in a way that seems driven more by Snapchat¡¯s intent to increase Story usage by piggybacking it on messaging as a reaction to increased competition from Facebook.An algorithmic Stories list? Great. Grouping all professional content creators together? Okay. Muddying its core use case with an upsell to money-making Stories? A risky bet when dealing with fickle teenagers."
33,Apps,"Facebook is making a huge change to its News Feed algorithm to prioritize friends and posts that spark comments between them at the expense of public content, news outlets and, importantly, the total time spent and ads you see on the social network.CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook today, ¡°I¡¯m changing the goal I give our product teams from focusing on helping you find relevant content to helping you have more meaningful social interactions.¡± VP of News Feed Adam Mosseri tells TechCrunch, ¡°I expect that the amount of distribution for publishers will go down because a lot of publisher content is just passively consumed and not talked about. Overall time on Facebook will decrease, but we think this is the right thing to do.¡±The winners in this change will be users and their sense of community, as they should find Facebook more rewarding and less of a black hole of wasted time viewing mindless video clips and guilty-pleasure articles. And long-term, it should preserve Facebook¡¯s business and ensure it still has a platform to provide referral traffic for news publishers and marketers, albeit less than before.The biggest losers will be publishers who¡¯ve shifted resources to invest in eye-catching pre-recorded social videos, because, Mosseri says, ¡°video is such a passive experience.¡± He?admits that he expects publishers to react with ¡°a certain amount of scrutiny and anxiety,¡± but didn¡¯t have many concrete answers about how publishers should scramble to react beyond ¡°experimenting ¡¦ and seeing ¡¦ what content gets more comments, more likes, more reshares.¡±This video from Facebook examines the upcoming changes, rolling out over ¡°the next few months¡±:As TechCrunch detailed in our deep dive on well-being last month called ¡°The difference between good and bad Facebooking,¡±?research increasingly shows that isolated feed scrolling can be harmful to people¡¯s health, while private chatting with friends and back-and-forth discussion of content can boost positive sentiments. On Facebook¡¯s Q3 earnings call, Zuckerberg said that ¡°Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits,¡± and today wrote that ¡°We feel a responsibility to make sure our services aren¡¯t just fun to use, but also good for people¡¯s well-being.¡±Now Facebook is putting its money, and its News Feed, where its mouth is. Zuckerberg writes, ¡°Now, I want to be clear: by making these changes, I expect the time people spend on Facebook and some measures of engagement will go down. But I also expect the time you do spend on Facebook will be more valuable.¡±In a blog post detailing the algorithm change, Mosseri writes Facebook will prioritize ¡°posts that inspire back-and-forth discussion in the comments and posts that you might want to share and react to . .?Because space in News Feed is limited, showing more posts from friends and family and updates that spark conversation means we¡¯ll show less public content, including videos and other posts from publishers or businesses.¡±In our conversation, he cited Oprah¡¯s recent Golden Globes speech as content that would fare better in the revamped feed. Live videos generating discussion, star social media creators, celebrities, Groups posts, local business events and trusted news sources are other types of content that should get a boost.On the other hand, ¡°Pages may see their reach, video watch time and referral traffic decrease.¡± He tells me that Facebook needs to ¡°react to the way the world has changed around us, especially the explosion in video.¡±Publishers will be forced to change strategies, and potentially lay off video staffers and those who produce quick-hit, low-quality content.Do we need more friends or news?The biggest point of contention about this change is likely that some media pundits and users will argue that seeing more news, even if it generates fewer comments than friends¡¯ photos or celebrity ephemera, is what will actually bring the world closer together. Filter bubbles could potentially be strengthened by showing more posts to friends, further polarizing a politically divided world.Zuckerberg¡¯s counter-argument also aligns with Facebook doubling down on what only its service, and not Twitter or news websites, can offer. ¡°Video and other public content have exploded on Facebook in the past couple of years,¡± Zuckerberg writes. ¡°Since there¡¯s more public content than posts from your friends and family, the balance of what¡¯s in News Feed has shifted away from the most important thing Facebook can do ? help us connect with each other.¡±Facebook¡¯s hope is surely that the most important news still makes it into the feed because your friends actively discuss it, though that may be giving people too much credit. Plenty of users would rather gab about their social lives than net neutrality or the tax plan.Over time, Facebook¡¯s algorithm change may be necessary to promote social cohesion and make the internet less exploitative?and more meaningful. The specifics of how it moves in this direction may injure publishers who¡¯ve built up businesses overly reliant on Facebook. But it¡¯s rare to see a public company announce it will immediately weaken its own business to give its customers a healthier lifestyle.You can read Zuckerberg¡¯s post in its entirety below:"

Kimetrak is a simple browser extension that lets you see how your favorite website is tracking you and selling your privacy.The upcoming ePrivacy and GDPR regulations in Europe have been a wake-up call in many ways. Arguably, bitcoin-mining scripts and Spectre JavaScript examples also have made people realize that you¡¯re not in control of what your browser is loading.Browsing the web feels like writing a blank check every time you load a page. Maybe you just want to read an article. And yet, many big websites embed dozens of third-party JavaScript calls (and unfortunately TechCrunch is one of them).Ad servers as well as big tech companies, such as Facebook and Google, can track your browsing habits and serve code that hasn¡¯t been reviewed in any way. Those companies can then build comprehensive profiles about you and leverage cookies to read and store personal data.That¡¯s why many people install ad-blocking extensions or disable JavaScript altogether. Some extensions, such as Ghostery or uBlock Origin, show you a list of all the scripts from third-party domains that got blocked.But Kimetrak isn¡¯t an ad blocker. The extension wants to educate people about trackers on the web. If you use an ad blocker, you¡¯re obviously not going to see much information. But if you disable your ad blocker and browse some of your favorite websites, you¡¯re going to be astonished with Kimetrak¡¯s information.And if you¡¯re running a popular website, you can also use Kimetrak to easily review all your third-party JavaScript embeds.For now, Kimetrak¡¯s data stays on your computer and isn¡¯t shared in any way with Next INpact. It¡¯s an open-source project so you can check for yourself. Eventually, Next INpact wants to build a general-purpose database of trackers and popular websites.

35,Apps,"Yet another uncomfortable revelation about Uber¡¯s legacy business and attitude to legal oversight: Between spring 2015 until late 2016 the ride-hailing giant routinely used a system designed to thwart police raids in foreign countries, according to?Bloomberg, citing three people with knowledge of the system.It reports that Uber¡¯s San Francisco office used the protocol ? which apparently came to be referred to internally as ¡®Ripley¡¯ ? at least two dozen times.?The system enabled staff to remotely change passwords and ¡°otherwise lock up data on company-owned smartphones, laptops, and desktops as well as shut down the devices¡±, it reports.We¡¯ve also been told ? via our own sources ? about multiple programs at Uber intended to prevent company data from being accessed by oversight authorities.The existence of the Ripley program has been alleged previously, in December 2016, when an ex-Uber security employee,?Ward Spangenberg, made a sworn statement saying he was part of an ¡°incident response team¡± that helped remotely erase data when Revenu Qu?bec?raided the company¡¯s Montreal offices?in 2015. (Allegations that Uber denied at the time.)But according to Bloomberg Uber created the system in response to raids on its offices in Europe: Specifically following a March 2015 raid on its Brussel¡¯s office in which police gained access to its payments system and financial documents as well as driver and employee information; and after a raid on its Paris office?in the same week.It says the idea came ? at least in part ? from a suggestion made by Uber¡¯s general counsel Sally Yoo (who resigned from the company in September). While the system was reportedly built by Uber¡¯s IT department, before being taken over by the security team in 2016.Last month?allegations that the company had systematic processes in place to put potential evidence beyond the reach of any investigating authorities ? including using encryption, secret servers and ephemeral messaging apps ? emerged via allegations made in a 37-page letter written by the attorney of Uber¡¯s former manager of global intelligence, Richard Jacobs (which was made public as a result of the ongoing Waymo vs Uber IP theft lawsuit).In the letter, Jacobs¡¯ attorney writes that his client¡¯s suggestion, early on during his employment, to create a secure and encrypted centralized database for ensuring ¡°recordkeeping and confidentiality¡± was rejected by Uber managers ¡°because?they objected to preserving any intelligence that would make?preservation and legal discovery a simple process for future litigants¡±.From the letter:Jacobs?then became?aware?that Uber, primarily through [in-house counsel Craig]?Clark and [head of global threat operations, Mat]?Henley, had?implemented a sophisticated?strategy?to?destroy,?conceal,?cover?up,?and falsify?records?or?documents?with the?intent?to?impede?or obstruct government?investigations?as?well?as?discovery?obligations?in?pending and future?litigation. Besides?violating?U.S.C.?1519,?this conduct?constitutes?an?ethical violation.Uber said last month that it has not substantiated all the claims in the letter ? some of which were also withdrawn by Jacobs (who previously reached a financial settlement with Uber).Clark is no longer employed by Uber, having been fired by Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi late last year following the revelations the company concealed a massive data breach?for the best part of a year. Head of security, Joe Sullivan, was also sacked at the same time. While Henley was last month reported?to be beginning a three-month medical leave.Bloomberg reports that the Ripley program was a closely guarded secret at Uber ? claiming that many staff in offices being raided were unaware of its existence.It adds that later versions of the system gave the company the ability to selectively provide information to government agencies that searched its foreign offices, with Uber¡¯s lawyers directing security engineers to selective disclose information to officials who had warrants to access its systems.Bloomberg also names another obfuscation system, it says was called uLocker, which it says was contemplated for times when Uber wanted to be ¡°less transparent¡±.A prototype version of the software could apparently present a dummy version of a typical login screen to police or other unwanted eyes. Though it says this was never implemented or used by Uber. According to the report, Uber¡¯s security team began working on the uLocker software in 2016, with the project overseen by John Flynn, Uber¡¯s still sitting CISO.In a response statement to Bloomberg¡¯s story, Uber told us: ¡°Like every company with offices around the world, we have security procedures in place to protect corporate and customer data. When it comes to government investigations, it¡¯s our policy to cooperate with all valid searches and requests for data.¡±We¡¯ve also heard of the existence of a program at Uber called uLocker, although one source with knowledge of the program told us that the intention was to utilize a ransomware cryptolocker exploit and randomize the tokens ? with the idea being that if Uber got raided it would cryptolocker its own devices in order to render data inaccessible to oversight authorities.The source said uLocker was being written in-house by Uber¡¯s eng-sec and Marketplace Analytics divisions (the latter being the unit previously reported to be focused on gathering intelligence from competitors).The same source told us that Uber had another?program intended to orchestrate the physical destruction of end-point workstations in the event of a raid by law enforcement ? again as a strategy to render company data inaccessible to external investigators.A different source with knowledge of Uber¡¯s processes, and who was taking legal advice at the time we spoke, declined to comment on those two programs but told us that Uber had a program in place, led by Clark, in which Uber staff in the US trained others on how to avoid discovery on a legal due process.Such controversial programs did not sit easily with every Uber employee who was aware of them, according to our discussions with sources, and appear to have contributed to some individual departure decisions ? above and beyond staff directly fired by Khosrowshahi as he seeks to clean house.An Uber spokeswoman confirmed the Ripley program¡¯s existence to us in a phone call but said its use was discontinued in 2016. She also said that it was the same software Uber had used when employees left the company to ensure they no longer had access to company systems.She told us she was not aware of any specific programs to train staff to avoid due legal process, noting that Jacobs ¡°walked back a lot of those statements under oath¡±.Regarding uLocker she confirmed the software exists, and said it is still in use at Uber, but described it as being for Mobile Device Management (saying it replaced a prior off-the-shelf MDM system that Uber had been using, called Prey) ? so used for locking devices and encrypting files such as in the event of a corporate device being stolen.The uLocker encryption process takes ¡°about a day, so it¡¯s not an immediate thing¡±, she added.Regarding Uber considering using uLocker to power a system of dummy logins, she said that was a feature proposed for the system but never implemented.¡°I know of two people who proposed that as an idea ? they are no longer at the company and that feature was never built or implemented in uLocker,¡± she told us, declining to name the individuals but specifying they weren¡¯t senior executives but front-line engineers.On the cryptolocker allegation, the spokeswoman reiterated ¡°that is not how uLocker works¡±, adding: ¡°uLocker is designed so we can unencrypt it.¡±¡°There¡¯s only ever been one version of uLocker. There were earlier conversations about what it should include ? but there¡¯s only ever been one version of it. And all it does is the locking and encryption.¡±The spokeswoman also told us she was not aware of any programs set up for physically destroying workstations in the event of a raid on an Uber office.She sent us Uber¡¯s current protocol for handling regulatory visits to its offices ? in which the company instructions employees to ¡°cooperate with the investigation¡±. It also explicitly warns staff: ¡°Do NOT delete, destroy, conceal any document or data¡±.So what might be the legal implications for companies that put programs in place intended to deliberately destroy or otherwise render information inaccessible at the point it¡¯s being sought by investigators or regulators?¡°If they have knowledge of a specific investigation and a specific¡¦ search warrant¡¦ and they encrypt while that raid¡¯s going on to stop the agents from accessing the computers that they have a court order to access that could be considered obstruction of justice,¡± says Josh Robbins, partner at litigation law firm?Greenberg Gross LLP, discussing the risks of companies trying to thwart regulatory oversight.¡°If they were encrypting computers without knowledge of a specific investigation but encrypting computers as a security measure, just generally, I think it would be hard to make the allegation of obstruction of justice because they¡¯d need to have knowledge of a specific investigation. It¡¯s just a general security measure.¡°But it shouldn¡¯t matter because if they receive a subpoena, say, or a court order to produce records then they have the obligation to use their decryption key and unlock the computers and access the information and provide it to the government ? and if they refuse to do that then they would be subject to sanctions, contempt of court and so on.¡±In a civil case, a court could penalize a company for engaging in what¡¯s known as ¡°spoliation of evidence¡±, he notes, suggesting the penalty could be anything from?¡°allowing the other side to tell a jury about the conduct (which could be very harmful to the trial) ? all the way up to just ruling against them without even going to trial¡±.¡°On the criminal side it could be ? again if they know about an existing investigation and they put this into place for the purpose of preventing information from ever being disclosed to the investigators that could be viewed as obstruction of justice, which is a criminal violation of a US law,¡± he adds.While Robbins confirms there is no general obligation on technology companies to keep their records in an accessible format, and firms are rather given flexibility in terms of how they manage their data security, there can still be legal risks given that companies can often have multiple litigation investigations ongoing at any given time (as Uber certainly now does, and has done for several years).¡°If any of the information at issue is relevant to any of those then they would have a problem doing that because they are effectively going to obstruct or impede that investigation or litigation so it would be legally risky to do that unless they know that it¡¯s not related to those things,¡± Robbins continues. ¡°Their policy can¡¯t override their general legal obligations to preserve and make available evidence.¡±He also points out that having systematic policies in place to render data inaccessible could have other negative impacts for companies ? citing the decision by London¡¯s transport regulator to withdraw Uber¡¯s operator license last year, with TfL explicitly mentioning the?Greyball program (another piece of in-house software, developed to help Uber avoid regulatory scrutiny by monitoring oversight activity) in its list of concerns.¡°As a prosecutor or a regulator recidivism is a huge issue in terms of how you approach a case and how aggressively you approach a case,¡± he says. ¡°And if somebody is seen to be a bad, repeat actor there is that much more of a need to deter their conduct by being very aggressive in enforcement, or take them out entirely.¡°In London¡¦ Uber is not welcome there anymore because of the Greyball incident. And probably not just Greyball but they¡¯re well aware of some of the other things that Uber has been involved in and you can see that attitude being taken probably by regulators state, local, federal, in various jurisdictions when they see an actor that seems like it is very consistent in its flouting of the law.¡±"

You can switch the conversation to any of your devices, but the messages you send and receive will be tied to the device you¡¯re using at the time.Discussing the collaboration on its blog, Signal?adds: ¡°Our goal is to make private communication simple and ubiquitous. With hundreds of millions of active users, Skype is one of the most popular applications in the world, and we¡¯re excited that Private Conversations in Skype will allow more users to take advantage of Signal Protocol¡¯s strong encryption properties for secure communication.¡±So is some opt-in e2e encryption better than no e2e encryption? Some would say ¡®barely¡¯. Especially as video chats ? the flagship Skype feature ? aren¡¯t covered.There¡¯s also likely to be debate over whether the feature risks confusing Skype users who might mistakenly believe all their comms on Skype are going to be strongly encrypted going forward ? when in fact they will have to actively choose e2e encryption every time they want to use it. Which clearly creates privacy friction. And also conditions Skype users to think of privacy as an exception, rather than the standard rule.Messaging platform Telegram also offers an e2e encrypted ¡®secret chats¡® feature on an otherwise not e2e encrypted comms platform, and is routinely attacked for taking this partial position, for example. (Though it is also critiqued for using its own proprietary crypto, rather than adopting a respected standard.)On the other hand ? and given how mainstream a comms platform Skype is ? then even partial e2e encryption could be seen as a bit of a step forward, perhaps most especially because Skype is adopting the Signal Protocol for its crypto addition.It¡¯s also possible ? and Signal is?hoping??? that Microsoft will expand support to cover more Skype features in time."

If they¡¯re complete enough to be powerful they are too difficult for beginners and if they¡¯re simple enough for beginners they¡¯re useless for serious work. Zeroqode, a one-stop-shop for codeless creation, aims to make the difficult easy and the easy more powerful.Created by Levon Terteryan and Vlad Larin, the project is based on Bubble, a new codeless development framework. To understand it think of Django-like autobuilder tools connected to an easy-to-use drag and drop interface. You add functionality by dropping in Trello-like cards that perform various actions.I worked with the team to rebuild my website in Bubble and they offered both hands-on assistance and showed me where things were going wrong. They are Bubble¡¯s certified partners. The team is bootstrapped and exhibited at Disrupt Berlin in 2017.¡°Our business consists of 2 main components: services (no-code development) and products (templates, plugins, courses etc.),¡± said Larin. It¡¯s the templates they¡¯re pitching most at this point as the services side is a bit harder to sell. By working with non-coders to get started with Bubble they open a pathway to future collaboration.¡°Our no-code templates and self-service products are helping to create and launch from 20 to 30 web products, with that number rapidly increasing in the last quarter,¡± said Larin.The team sees itself as a dev-in-a-box solution. The teams¡¯ first products are 28 simple templates for users to recreate their favorite services and to learn Bubble along the way.¡°What we do costs our clients just a fraction of what they would otherwise pay to the developers,¡± said Larin. ¡°Most of our no-code developers have been web designers prior to joining our team. We have trained them to work in Bubble and build complex functionality.
So now 1 person can do everything ? UI/UX design + workflows + database configuration + debugging etc thus reducing the complexity of traditional development where a team of at least 5 people is usually required to build a complex web application.¡±With the team¡¯s help I was able to understand Bubble nearly completely and begin working on my redesign. The team helped considerably but their templates were very usable and very affordable. The finished app is as polished as I could make it but, seeing as I haven¡¯t coded professionally since 2000, it seemed fine. Hosting the app on Bubble costs $14 a month.¡°The goal is not to allow our users to create a copy of AirBNB or Uber but to empower them launch any product that is resembling the functions of one of the big names in the startup world, with person adding his unique feature on top of the great baseline, doing that faster and with way less costs involved,¡± said Larin.The team has seen unfunded startups using their code to build MVPs and even final products. The team had been building complex and expensive products for clients but they wanted to service smaller companies. When they found Bubble they knew they could be helpful.¡°The business has started growing exponentially and In under 2 years the team has grown from 1 person to 17,¡± said Larin. ¡°Now we have 10+ no-code developers which in traditional development capacity would compare to around four or five times more than that.¡±¡°The goal is to make Zeroqode for complex web apps what WordPress has become for simpler web-sites,¡± he said.Check out my talk with Larin at Disrupt Berlin."

On the software front, mobile connect is a free offering that will be bundled with all new Dell computers. The application delivers mobile notifications to the desktop via Bluetooth. It¡¯s a bit like some of the functionality offered up by Cortana on Windows or Notification Center on macOS, only it doesn¡¯t require you to sign into each individual account on the desktop. The apps themselves don¡¯t need to be approved by Dell, either. As long as you can get a notification on your phone, you¡¯ll see it on the screen.?The only things it does require, in fact, are a new Dell computer and a smartphone within Bluetooth range. The company gave us a demo of the app at our booth, and the system performs as advertised, popping up a small notification box in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. (Disclosure: The shipping version works with Bluetooth, but this demo was hardwired, due to the crazy wireless pollution at a show like CES.)From there, you can respond in a dialog box or click through to a mirrored image of your phone¡¯s screen. That¡¯s a fun little added bonus ? if you have a touchscreen, you can actually navigate the handset straight from the desktop, making it possible to play mobile games on the bigger screen. The Dell rep ran us through a bunch of different scenarios, like getting a call, fielding an Instagram notification and ordering an Uber. Notably, Dell says the application will work with both Android and iOS, by way of a mobile app. The functionality is set to arrive on January 27. "
39,Apps,"YouTube may bring its set of social features, including the in-app messaging system and?¡°Community¡± tab for creators, to its wider suite of apps. Specifically, the company is interested in porting those features to its YouTube TV app aimed at cord cutters, as well as its Music app.The company won¡¯t confirm a timeline in terms of if or when these features would launch, but it¡¯s something that¡¯s clearly being thought about by YouTube product strategy.The move could help further differentiate YouTube¡¯s over-the-top streaming service, YouTube TV, from competitors like Sling TV, Hulu Live TV, PlayStation Vue and others. And it would allow the company to leverage its strengths in social features to build out a larger platform that spans both web and mobile properties in order create a large, combined user base of people who stream media content on their devices.¡°People think about YouTube as this place where you play your favorite video content ? and of course it is. But really what it is underneath is this kind of community that exists underneath between content creators and fans; and fans and fans,¡± said YouTube?Chief Product Officer, Neal Mohan, in a conversation at CES where he talked about how he sees the potential for adding social features to more YouTube products.¡°We?think that magic of YouTube that exists in the main experience can apply to YouTube TV experience as well,¡± he said.For example, YouTube¡¯s in-app video sharing and messaging feature, launched back in summer 2017, offers a way for friends to share videos and their reactions without having to leave the YouTube app to use another mobile messaging service.Mohan says this is the sort of feature that would make sense to bring to YouTube TV ? or even YouTube¡¯s Music app ? in the future.When added to YouTube TV, the messaging feature would basically look the same as it does today in YouTube¡¯s mobile app.¡°I don¡¯t want to create any additional cognitive load for users ? every user of the YouTube TV app is probably also a YouTube user. It should feel familiar. Their friends are the same,¡± said Mohan.He added that the idea of porting social features from YouTube to YouTube TV makes sense for the community features YouTube has been building, as well, such as the new Community tab where creators can interact with fans.¡°That¡¯s where content creators are posting not just video, but images, text, and polls and just interacting with their community. I think that¡¯s a concept that can apply regardless of the type of content,¡± Mohan said.In practice, this could mean that TV content creators would have their own tab to engage their fan base directly in the app where you¡¯re consuming their content.This isn¡¯t something only YouTube is planning, of course. Hulu this week said that it was also developing social features to better highlight what friends are watching and recommending, as well as those that could offer a co-viewing experience. (YouTube, meanwhile, has been testing co-watching in an app called Uptime, developed within Google¡¯s internal R&D division, Area 120.)Philo, a new low-cost, sports-free streaming service, also has social features in development that it plans to launch this year.In other words, adding a social layer to the TV watching experience may not be a differentiator for YouTube long-term, but that doesn¡¯t mean it won¡¯t have an advantage in this space.¡°YouTube is well-positioned to deliver those types of really interesting use cases to our consumers,¡± said Mohan.That is, YouTube has always been a social community of sorts ? it¡¯s just that, now, that community is being better surfaced through features like the new tab for creator-to-fan interaction and in-app messaging.?"

After all, we all tend to enjoy our pornography on our personal devices.Android and iOS are nearly tied in their usage as porn delivery vessels, while Windows wins in the desktop OS war. Chrome is the most popular browser followed by Internet Explorer. Edge and Safari share a middling 8 percent of fapster activity. The Xbox and PlayStation are two reliable porn systems, and even the Nintendo 3DS got a hearty 1 percent.Interestingly, the celebrity searches portion of the report showed deep, expected interest in Kim Kardashian, but also YouTube gamers like SSSniperWolf.

The service had originally debuted on iPad, iPhone and iPod touch in early December, but today¡¯s launch will also see it arrive on the Amazon Appstore in the U.S., as well.The app¡¯s debut has not been without controversy.The move comes at a difficult time for Facebook and for social media in general, where there are increasing concerns about social media¡¯s ability to addict adults, and the impact that screen time has on children in particular.Just this week, for example, Apple responded to investor concerns that the company needs to do more in terms of giving parents a way to limit children¡¯s phone use. Apple said it would add new parental control features to its software.Facebook, meanwhile, has been criticized across a number of fronts over the past year or so, from its ability to spread disinformation and create divides to how it¡¯s able to hijack users¡¯ brains?to create an addiction of sorts. In that light, the launch of Messenger Kids has been criticized as the equivalent of cigarette marketers targeting underage smokers.That said, as a parent myself, it¡¯s one of those things that¡¯s not as simple to dismiss as you might think.The truth is, young kids are messaging each other anyway ? through apps like Musical.ly, Snapchat and on iMessage. None of these have any tools for parental controls, which actually makes it harder to for parents who do try to monitor their children¡¯s usage of devices and communication software when they¡¯re young.It¡¯s very difficult today to help guide kids to the online world ? and, yet, it¡¯s still something that has to be done. Though we may not like it at times, the web is not going to go away, nor will people all of a sudden stop communicating and networking online.Facebook, at least, has done?something ? even as the major tech companies, like Apple, have ignored parents¡¯ concerns for years on this front.Whether Facebook is the right company to aid in this matter, however, is a valid question. Its interests, after all, are about developing a new generation of users who become reliant on its platform, so it can continue to grow its ad business to the tune of billions.The new Fire tablet version of Messenger Kids is here."
42,Apps,"Messaging app Confide, which was last year touted as a popular choice in Trump¡¯s White House for staff wanting to leak intel to the press, has added protection against screenshotting to its iOS app.The iOS app previously put some limitations on how users could screenshot contents when using the app ? but full anti-screenshotting tech was limited to its Android app.Not anymore, says co-founder Jon Brod. ¡°ScreenShield is a collection of several different technologies that work together to prevent various screenshots and screen recording techniques,¡± he says, discussing the new feature.¡°There are many ways to capture a screenshot or make a screen recording on iOS, and each method requires different handling. One of the newest prevention technologies that we added to our toolkit utilizes the same content protection APIs already used by Netflix, iTunes Movies, and other video streaming apps. We have built upon the underlying technology to prevent capture of other media types including text, photos, documents, stickers, and more. Importantly, we are only using public iOS APIs in our ScreenShield technology.¡±Anti-screenshotting technology like this is really just security theatre, of course.Not least because all it takes is a second device, unconnected but in close proximity to the first, to snap away and record its on-screen contents regardless.Even so, Brod claims there¡¯s still value in the feature, despite such an obvious loophole. ¡°While nothing is 100% foolproof, we believe the combination of our end-to-end encryption, ephemerality, and now complete screenshot-prevention makes?Confide?the most private and secure messenger available,¡± he claims.However rather more serious charges of flawed security were leveled at the messaging platform?last March?? when researchers demonstrated it was possible to intercept encrypted Confide messages, and claimed the platform could in fact decrypt and read users¡¯ missives (rather undermining its end-to-end encryption claim).Asked about this now, Brod says all the security issues raised by the researchers were addressed ¡°in a timely fashion as soon as they were reported to us last year¡±.¡°Confide?implemented safety codes, which are a cryptographic hash that includes all public encryption keys for an account. Users can validate the keys used by?Confide¡®s end-to-end encryption by ensuring that the safety code displayed on their device matches the one displayed on their contacts¡¯ device. We also allow users to be notified if the safety code for one of their contacts changes,¡± he tells us.¡°We also underwent a comprehensive third-party security audit including blackbox, greybox and whitebox testing, covering both the client and server.

46,Apps,"In a betrayal of loyalty signaling poor morale, a massive dump of Snapchat¡¯s usage stats has leaked. The most worrisome is that the number of users posting Stories has shown zero growth, an even worse performance than Snapchat¡¯s total user growth that was sluggish this year. It appears Instagram¡¯s Stories clone has stopped Snapchat¡¯s most monetizable feature dead in its tracks.This explains why Snapchat¡¯s redesign moves friends¡¯ Stories into the chat inbox, since visual messaging on the app is growing slightly faster than total users. Messaging is tough to interrupt with ads without being annoying, so combining messages and Stories might be Snap¡¯s best shot at reinvigorating revenue.Yet the leak as a whole paints a picture of an app that¡¯s falling short of living up to its reputation?as a communication sensation. And with weak morale, a sagging share price, and losses mounting, Snap might not have the momentum it needs to recruit top talent or lure more big acquisitions. It¡¯s evolved social media, but is in the angsty throes of maturing as a public company.The leak was scored by The Daily Beast¡¯s?Taylor Lorenz, who is quickly making a name for herself as a top reporter on social networks and teen tech culture. She managed to obtain usage data for a wide range of Snapchat¡¯s feature from the end of April to mid-September 2017. You can see the full set of charts at the bottom of this story.As Lorenz reports, the Snap Map live location sharing and geo-tagged content search feature has sunk from a high of 35 million daily unique viewers after its June launch to just 19 million and falling ? just 11 percent of Snapchat¡¯s users. The Discover section where professional publishers post magazine-esque daily editions spiked to 38 million in July, and then has languished at around 34 million daily users ? about 19 percent of all users. And usage could fall further as Discover is less prominent in the redesign that¡¯s yet to roll out to most users.Snapchat¡¯s new redesignSnap should get credit for soaking up a ton of time from those who do use it, with the app growing average minutes of usage from around 32.7 to 34.8 during the April to September time period.And the brightest point in the data was that the number of daily Snaps viewed rose from around 3.9 billion to 4.6 billion, or 17.9 percent, which vastly outstrips the roughly 7 percent total user growth in the same time period.Daily Snaps sent grew from around 2.08 billion to 2.21 billion, in line with total user growth.?In August, Lorenz reports that users were 64 percent more likely to send a private snap to a friend than to broadcast to Stories.Here¡¯s where the Facebook competition is really hurting Snapchat. Back in Q2 2016 before Instagram Stories came out, Snapchat grew its user base 17.2 percent. Last quarter, it grew just 2.9 percent, as many users find they can just stick with Instagram and share Stories to their existing social graph where they already post permanent imagery rather than building a new graph on Snapchat.The number of daily users posting to Snapchat Stories held flat at around 51 million users from April to September despite total user growth. That signals that while people may be sticking with or coming to Snapchat to send disappearing messages to friends, they don¡¯t necessarily need to post to Snapchat Stories.Daily Snapchat Story unique viewers grew 4.37 percent from 137 million to 143 million during the time period ? significantly slower than total user growth. Users who do broadcast to Snapchat Stories are posting more often, at least, and are using more Geofilters. But advertisers want scale, and the lack of total Stories sharers is troubling.With messaging remaining by far its most popular feature, Snapchat may have to massively increase its augmented reality Sponsored Lens and static Sponsored Geofilter sales to make up for the lack of ads in the feature. Otherwise, it will have to risk pissing off teens by jamming more scalable display ads into the messaging experience.Overall, Snap has a rocky road ahead. New features like Snap Map and professional content in Discover don¡¯t appear able to change its fate. The company¡¯s best hope for now is that users grow addicted to algorithmic sorting of Stories to show best friends first, which back in April we recommended it adopt. That¡¯s now finally coming in the redesign, and could make it easier to open Snapchat and quickly see the most relevant stuff from the people you care about.Beyond that, Snapchat might need another blockbuster acquisition to restore growth. Bitmoji¡¯s personalized avatars and Looksery¡¯s AR lenses gave Snapchat mainstream appeal outside of its ephemerality. But with tales of CEO Evan Spiegel¡¯s iron grip on product, a share price down 50 percent from its post-IPO high, and Facebook¡¯s copying machine running at full-tilt, Snap isn¡¯t as attractive of a place to work as it was when it made those acquisitions.Snapchat has been incredibly impactful on culture. From impermanent content to vertical video, popularizing augmented reality and bringing on the age of visual communication, Speigel¡¯s ideas have redefined the way we share. Unfortunately, Snapchat hasn¡¯t been able to capture much of the monetary benefits of those inventions as they get cloned elsewhere.The popularity of Snapchat messaging amongst western teenagers means it won¡¯t disappear overnight. But it may be time for it and the world to face the fact that Snapchat could be world-changing product without ever becoming a world-dominating business."
47,Apps,"Fresh from its first international expansion following the acquisition of Brazil¡¯s 99 last week, Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing announced another significant move by revealing plans for its own bike-sharing platform.The platform will integrate Ofo ? the company that counts Didi as an investor ? as well as?financially stricken service Bluegogo?? which Didi has been linked with ? and other ¡°potential partners¡± further down the line.Importantly, Didi will roll out its own bike-sharing service ? but there¡¯s no timeframe on that.That¡¯s quite a lot to digest, but in reality the signs of something brewing have been on display.Last year Didi¡¯s app integrated rides from Ofo?? which competes with Mobike as the world¡¯s largest bike-sharing companies ? but Chinese media reports suggested that the two companies fell out in recent months. That¡¯s said to be after Didi dispatched executives to work inside Ofo, only to have them return, while Mobike and Ofo have stolen a portion of Didi¡¯s short distance rides by offering a simpler option than waiting on a driver.Indeed, in Ofo¡¯s case, the company has even expanded to offer some Didi-like taxi-hailing services.That appears to be where Bluegogo might come into the picture. The company, which had been third to billion-dollar-valued Ofo and Mobike, suffered a financial meltdown at the end of 2017 despite having raised some $90 million.The company went quiet amid reports of its imminent closure, but in recent weeks there have been rumors of a deal with Didi. Didi isn¡¯t buying the company as some had claimed, in fact it isn¡¯t exactly clear what the financial relationship is.We asked Didi to clarify but are waiting to hear back.An Ofo bike in ShanghaiThe short announcement from the company today said it had ¡°reached agreement with Bluegogo on cooperation arrangements.¡± The most obvious part to that is integrating its service into the popular Didi app, which claims 450 million registered users across a range of services beyond simply taxi rides, but you¡¯d presume that there is some financial support too given Bluegogo¡¯s issues.As for Bluegogo¡¯s existing users, who paid up for a deposit for the service and probably figured it was lost, Didi is offering to convert the sum into credit for its services. It said that it will not charge users deposits for bike services on its new platform.This move is an intriguing one when you consider that there have been persistent rumors of a merger between Ofo and Mobike. That seems to be what is fueling Didi¡¯s move, which is a fairly hostile one against Ofo.Why else would Didi ? which let¡¯s remember is a company that purports to be valued at $56 billion based on December¡¯s $4 billion fundraise ? end Ofo¡¯s exclusive integration inside its app by adding a company that is on its last legs just to provide more competition.?It certainly seems Didi is fearful of an Ofo-Mobike consolidation move, and, having already bought out its biggest competitor Uber China, bike-sharing may have been marked as the main risk to its business at home on Chinese soil.You could argue that integrating bike sharing services benefits the companies, and that¡¯s true to a point when they are emerging. But privately Mobike and Ofo would acknowledge that having users on the service via their own app gives them a lot more control, not to mention the potential to enter new verticals that might challenge Didi. With an all-encompassing platform like this, Didi is bidding to be the gatekeeper in control. It would prefer Ofo, Mobike and Bluegogo to be features inside its app, rather than full-blown competition, and that¡¯s exactly what this plan makes them.We¡¯ll have to see how the platform plays out ? Didi has omitted to give a lot of important details at this stage ? but it seems clear enough bike-sharing has gone from a nice addition to the enemy.Article updated to correct that Didi invested in Ofo"

Users of Micgoat can propose topics such as ¡°will bitcoin crash¡± or ¡°we should have universal basic income,¡± and then make a short, one-minute video about the topic. Users who watch the video can then reply with their own 30-second videos.The idea is that it is too easy to troll on traditional social networks, not to mention that bot networks can quickly devolve interesting debates. By emphasizing video in its product, Micgoat¡¯s goal is to persuade people to talk to one another in a more human way, reducing the disinhibition effect that comes from posting text online.Users can scroll through different debates on the platformThe app is the brainchild of Justin Zhen and Gregory Ugwi, the co-founders of Thinknum, a New York-based financial data and analysis platform, along with Marta Lopata, who joined the company last year and is now Micgoat¡¯s CEO. Thinknum has previously raised a seed round from Pejman Mar Ventures.Having watched the 2016 U.S. presidential election along with debates on technology subjects like bitcoin, the three realized that they shared a common passion around the quickly degrading quality of debates online. ¡°I think what a great debate looks like is when there are two people from completely different backgrounds who are able to come together and talk about controversial issues,¡± Lopata explained to me. Too often, existing social networks just don¡¯t offer that sort of quality.Lopata, whose background is in entrepreneurship and who spent five years in Asia, believes that a product like Micgoat has the opportunity to turn the tide. She emphasized that there are multiple sides to most debates, and that the combination of video and showing two sides is a powerful antidote to the belief that each of our own views is automatically correct.While politics is what most people think of when they hear debates, technology and finance are industries where passions can be even more intense. Those industries also are very familiar to Thinknum, whose clients are financial analysts.Zhen said, ¡°Since we have the technology in place, people can debate sports, or local politics. Right now, there is no efficient channel for local politicians to get up in front of their constituents, since Fox News and CNBC don¡¯t cover those races. We can be just part of the everyday dialogue.¡±Thinknum staff are helping with the product development and engineering of the product today. Lopata says that ¡°Right now we see a balance of working together, and long-term we can see us spinning out.¡± There are three full-time employees on Micgoat, and another seven members borrowed from the core Thinknum team.Long-term, the team hopes to add more ¡°gamification¡± features to encourage everyone in the community to engage with the debates. In addition, the team is optimizing its search algorithms so users will be able to better find the most interesting debates. Zhen suggested that audio transcription would allow for better searching while maintaining the video experience of the app. The company also intends to release an Android version shortly.So far, abuse has not been a problem, according to the company. Zhen believes that the combination of Facebook identity and showing one¡¯s face in the app helps reduce the abuse that can be endemic on other platforms. As the platform scales up, the team intends to be very careful to ensure that the community stays positive even when discussing tough challenges."
50,Apps,"It was a fun experiment, but it¡¯s time to shut it down. M users received messages today that Facebook is sunsetting the service on January 19th. The company confirmed the news in a statement to The Verge.Facebook first introduced M back in August 2015. While the plan was to progressively roll it out to all users, it has remained in private beta since its initial launch.M was an innovative feature in 2015. At the time, Amazon just launched the Echo and Google Assistant wasn¡¯t around yet. Facebook used Messenger and text-based interactions for its personal assistant.But M¡¯s secret sauce wasn¡¯t artificial intelligence ? it was good old humans. Behind the scenes, M relied on humans to answer the most complicated queries. For instance, you could book a table at a restaurant, order flowers, organize your next vacation and more using M. Facebook leveraged its acquisition of Wit.ai to develop M.Eventually, Facebook hoped that those humans would help train the artificial intelligence model to rely less and less on humans. According to The Verge, people who were working on M will be offered other jobs at Facebook.The name M isn¡¯t going to die altogether, though. Facebook now offers AI-powered suggestions in Messenger conversations. For instance, if you¡¯re planning to grab drinks with a friend, Messenger can suggest to set up a reminder. If somebody is asking you where you are, M will suggest sending your location.While the name is similar, those AI-powered features are quite different from the concierge feature. But most users never interacted with the personal assistant in the first place."
51,Apps,"If you¡¯ve gotten three apps and a Fitbit so you can get skinnier this year, don¡¯t worry so much about summer beach season or holiday weight gain. Instead, worry about Thursday.Researchers at University of South Carolina found that self-reporting of food was integral to weight loss but that self-reporters often fell off, seemingly around the holidays. ¡°A key question we wanted to answer is what impact the holiday season has on individuals¡¯ efforts to monitor their calorie intake,¡± said lead author Christine A. Pellegrini, PhD.They gave a dieting app to a group of 32 obese adults and asked them to self-report over various seasons. The app could tell when they reported intake, allowing the researchers to see when folks stopped reporting.From the release:After analysis of the data, a reduction in the number of foods reported by each person was seen with each successive day in the study. There was also a weekend effect such that participants reported significantly fewer foods between Thursday and Sunday relative to Monday. The study, however, determined that although more food was reported in January, an overall seasonality effect was not observed.¡°Adults generally gain weight during the holidays and self-monitoring can help to manage weight during this period,¡± reported Pellegrini. ¡°Weight loss is a common New Year¡¯s resolution and may explain the increased number of foods reported in January; however, the typical pattern of self-monitoring during the holidays is not well established.¡±The researchers saw food self-reporting fall off on a weekly basis between Thursday and Sunday which suggests that we are good at reporting what we eat at the beginning of the week but, as opportunities to cheat enter our weekend radar, we slow down considerably.The bottom line? ¡°Based on this study¡¯s findings, providing these prompts on weekends may improve adherence to self-monitoring recommendations,¡± wrote the researchers. Basically someone has to remind us not to pig out on our days of rest."
52,Apps,"Google is simplifying the way it presents its different payments tools to consumers, uniting them under a new brand called Google Pay.In a Google blog post, Vice President of Product Management for Payments Pali Bhat described this as more of a rebranding than a change to the underlying products or technology. He said the products being brought together include Android Pay (Google¡¯s mobile payments and loyalty platform) and Google Wallet (its peer-to-peer payments app).Over time, this should make buying and paying through Google less confusing ? if you¡¯ve saved your payment information in your Google account, you don¡¯t have to worry which app to use to access that information, because it¡¯s all under Google Pay.¡°With Google Pay, it¡¯ll be easier for you to use the payment information saved to your Google Account, so you can speed through checkout with peace of mind,¡± Bhat wrote. ¡°Over the coming weeks, you¡¯ll see Google Pay online, in store, and across Google products, as well as when you¡¯re paying friends.¡±For starters, when you make a purchase from Google, or from partner apps and stores, you¡¯ll start to see Google Pay as an option. Initial partners include Airbnb, Dice, Fandango, HungryHouse and Instacart.¡°Google Pay provides a simple, intuitive option for Fandango customers to speed through checkout with just one tap,¡± said Mark Young, Fandango¡¯s senior vice president of global strategy & business development, in a press release. ¡°We look forward to working with Google as they grow this exciting new payment platform.¡±To promote the launch, Google is also offering special discounts when you buy something via Google Pay from B&H, Fandango and Instacart."
53,Apps,"Kohler, a name you may recognize from the faucet, or commercials about a faucet, is delivering a new line of smart bathroom and kitchen appliances called Kohler Konnect. Because why not?With the help of Alexa, these appliances can be given various voice commands to perform specific tasks. The line includes a shower, a bathtub, two toilets, a mirror, and a kitchen sink. The platform primarily runs off Microsoft Azure, but some of the new products are also compatible with Apple HomeKit and Google Assistant. In short, you should be able to hook these in with the broader IoT ecosystem of your choosing.Each product pairs to your phone through the Kohler Konnect app and lets you set preferences across a number of different users.First off, Kohler has introduced a new mirror called the Verdera Voice Lighted Mirror. It¡¯s said to be the first mirror with Alexa built directly into the unit, and it has its own lights which can be adjusted via voice. Beyond controlling the lights (and a nifty little motion-controlled nightlight), the mirror also has access to the general Alexa portfolio of skills.Also in the bathroom, Kohler has built the DTV+ Showering System. Like the other Konnect products, the shower is voice activated. (What could go wrong?) In all seriousness, the DTV+ Smart Showering System seems pretty ideal for (wealthy) couples who have different preferences but share a shower. It lets you set the sound, water, steam and lighting in a single command, such as ¡°Start my morning shower.¡±In a similar vein, Kohler has developed ¡®PerfectFill¡¯ technology for the bathtub, letting users set their intended temperature and simply tell the bathtub to fill with water.Kohler has introduced two new toilets at CES. The first, and most luxurious, is the Numi intelligent toilet. It comes with a sensor that knows you¡¯re approaching and automatically offers up a foot warmer and heated seat. The Numi also has a bidet, ambient lighting and can play music.The other toilet, equipped with Touchless Response, lets you wave your hand to flush. It also has an auto-warming seat that can be triggered via voice, and comes with a nightlight.Then we move into the kitchen with the Sensate faucet, which lets you ask for specific measurements of water. For example, the user could ask for eight ounces of water to be poured into a baby¡¯s bottle during the night shift, as shown in the demo video.You can check out the applications of these new Kohler products in the promo video below:"

This is an essential feature for lots of commercial drone applications and testing, and the fewer apps and platforms you need to accomplish a task, the better.Kittyhawk (not to be confused with Larry Page and Sebastian Thrun¡¯s Kitty Hawk) is an app that puts many of the most frequently needed drone-related services in one place: pre-flight checklists, airspace maps, hyperlocal weather, flight planning, live secure video, and now, direct flight automation via waypoints.It¡¯s pretty straightforward: just set your home location, then start picking coordinates, altitudes, and attitudes ? as well as some aesthetic choices like whether you want the drone to round off its turns or follow them down to inch.In a helpful touch that may prevent some embarrassing flight failures, the system won¡¯t let you set waypoints outside the range of the drone or the control radio. So no accidentally fat-fingering a flight path that takes your Phantom a couple thousand miles off course.There are plenty of options out there for the many new commercial and semi-pro drone operations popping up all over the place, but it never hurts to add more capabilities or gather them into one handy app. The new features should arrive soon, but the company didn¡¯t provide a date."
55,Apps,"A team of former Tinder employees, led by Tinder¡¯s original CTO Ryan Ogle, are today launching a new app aimed at professional networking. The app, called Ripple, aims to be a sort of mobile-first alternative to LinkedIn that addresses some of the problems common to the aging, now Microsoft-owned business networking platform.LinkedIn today has a heavy focus on job searching and head hunting, which is only a subset of professional networking, and is plagued with issues like unwanted connection requests and inbox spam, among other things.In addition, LinkedIn came about in the days of the desktop web, which has since limited its abilities to fully take advantage of what mobile has to offer, explains Ogle.However, he¡¯s careful to clarify that Ripple (not to be confused with the cryptocurrency, by the way), isn¡¯t just a ¡°Tinder for business networking.¡±Rather, it takes some of the psychological principles that helped Tinder become a top app in its own market, and has repurposed those for use in professional networking.¡°You have to address the problems with professional networking itself. It isn¡¯t as easy as just throwing profiles up on a screen,¡± Ogle says of competing apps that have tried to enter the business networking space in the past.¡°People have misconstrued why Tinder succeeded,¡± he continues. ¡°Certainly, the swipe was interesting, engaging and fun. But the reasons why Tinder succeeded were far deeper than that. We thought a lot about the psychology of networking and the problems¡¦what holds people back and prevents them from achieving what they want to achieve.¡±On other dating platforms, it was common to allow people to message anyone they liked. Tinder, on the other hand, shifted the focus as to who¡¯s next, not who you tried to reach and who rejected you.In this way, Tinder addressed the stress that comes with being either the pursued or the pursuer. It only connects you when a match is mutually agreed upon, and it doesn¡¯t show you a history of your past ¡°likes.¡±With Ripple, the goal is to take a similar problem-solving approach to business networking¡¯s challenges, which differ from those in the dating world.Ripple got its start as an internal Tinder hackathon project. But instead of introducing business networking as a Tinder feature (as Bumble has now done), the company realized it deserved to be its own app.IAC¡¯s Match Group, which owns Tinder and a number of other dating apps, came to an agreement with Tinder to spin-off Ripple App Corp. into a separate company and fund it. Match Group now has an undisclosed, minority stake in the new app. The company has no other outside investment, though the founders have put some of their own money in.In addition to Ogle, other co-founders include Tinder¡¯s first Android developer Paul Cafardo and Tinder lead designer Gareth Johnson.Despite Ogle¡¯s claims that Ripple isn¡¯t just a biz-flavored Tinder, using Ripple feels very familiar.Getting started is fairly simple. At launch, the app is able to automatically pull in your information from existing networks like Twitter, LinkedIn and Google when you sign up, making filling out profiles quicker.You¡¯re then taken to a screen where you can select your interests ? like sales, marketing, technology, etc.And while it does leverage the swipe mechanism, it attempts to downplay Tinder¡¯s focus on photos by putting more text information on users¡¯ cards that can be viewed without having to leave their profile ? like job history, skills, education, mutual connections and events attending.But, at the end of the day, Ripple shows you stacks of photos you swipe through, saying ¡°yes¡± or ¡°no.¡±The app additionally offers a way to find potential connections nearby, a way to create events and groups other users can opt to join.More controversially, there¡¯s a ¡°face scan¡± feature which ? as you may have guessed ? lets you aim your smartphone at someone¡¯s face (or a photo of them) to find them on Ripple.In theory, this should be used with consent ? to make it faster to add new connections and ditch the use of business cards. We haven¡¯t been able to test this in the real world to see if it works at a distance, which could be problematic.There are, of course, other concerns with a Tinder-inspired business networking app: the potential for harassment from people using the app for non-professional purposes. Ripple will attempt to address this through a built-in reporting feature in an upcoming release (It wasn¡¯t ready for version 1, but the company isn¡¯t expecting a large number of users in its first few days, we¡¯re told.)Reporting users will later also involve a swipe-based, mini-game of sorts where users can flag others for a variety of issues. Ripple¡¯s algorithms will use this activity, combined with other signals, to filter out bad actors ? including not only harassers, but also those whose advances aren¡¯t liked for other reasons, like pushy recruiters or spammers.¡°That¡¯s going to be one of our big differentiators. We¡¯re going to be very aggressive in eliminating people who are doing things for non-professional reasons,¡± Ogle claims.We have only been able to test Ripple¡¯s beta build, which had a number of bugs. Hopefully, those are handled at launch.Ripple is available on both iOS and Android, starting today."
56,Apps,"Encrypted messaging startup Telegram plans to launch its own blockchain platform and native cryptocurrency, powering payments on its chat app and beyond. According to multiple sources which have spoken to TechCrunch, the ¡°Telegram Open Network¡± (TON) will be a new, ¡®third generation¡¯ blockchain with superior capabilities, after Bitcoin and, later, Ethereum paved the way.The launch will be funded with an enormous Initial Coin Offering, with forthcoming private pre-sales ranging into the hundreds of millions, potentially making it one of the largest ICOs to date. Demand is driven by the fact that rather than the ICO coming from a fresh startup, Telegram is a well-established messaging platform used around the world.Adopting a homegrown cryptocurrency could give Telegram¡¯s payment system enormous independence from any government or bank ? something Co-founder and CEO Pavel Durov is known to covet after investors took over his last company, Russian social network VK. Durov has not responded to TechCrunch¡¯s several attempts to contact him regarding this story.The potential for a cryptocurrency inside a widely adopted messaging app is enormous.With cryptocurrency powered payments inside Telegram, users could bypass remittance fees when sending funds across international borders, move sums of money privately thanks to the app¡¯s encryption, deliver micropayments that would incur too high of credit card fees, and more. Telegram is already the de facto communication channel for the global cryptocurrency community, making a natural home to its own coin and Blockchain.Telegram is understood to be considering raising as much as $500 million in the pre-ICO sale at a potential total token value in the range of $3 billion to $5 billion. However, those figures could change before the ICO, which could come as soon as March.?Those figures would make it possibly the biggest private crypto raise to date after Tezos, which raised over $230 million in July.A pre-sale in an ICO is a minimum cap on investments (sometimes with discounts) to attract big investors (¡®whales¡¯) before a wider token sale to retail investors. The public, retail phase of an ICO tends to raise less because there is a long tail of people investing small sums. But front-loading the ICO with institutional investment inspires confidence for retail investors.Those pre-sale investors may be required to place a minimum buy-in of $20 million if they¡¯re outside of Durov¡¯s inner circle. Sources say that the ICO will require real fiat currency like US dollars for buy-in, not Bitcoin or Ether as others ICOs have to date.Top-tier institutional investment firms have expressed interest, but Durov is said to be wary of accepting their cash. One firm rumored to have pushed for a pre-sale allocation is?Mail.Ru Group (formerly DST), founded by Russian emigre Yuri Milner. A spokesperson for DST did not reply to our inquiry about this story. Interestingly, Mail.Ru Group is the fund that ended up buying Durov¡¯s last company VK.Durov¡¯s idea is to launch an entirely new blockchain, using the Telegram¡¯s 180 million users as rocket fuel to power forward into mainstream adoption off cryptocurrency and making Telegram, effectively, a kingmaker of other cryptocurrencies, because of its existing scale.According to Telegram¡¯s white paper that TechCrunch has review portions of, its cryptocurrency will be called ¡°Gram¡± and could potentially gain immediate mainstream adoption by being tied to Telegram¡¯s chat app.Sources say Durov has decided to combine both a centralized and decentralized infrastructure, since a totally decentralized network doesn¡¯t scale as fast as one which has some elements of centralization, hence why Telegram needs to own its own blockchain.Moving to a decentralized blockchain platform could kill two birds with one stone for Telegram. As well as creating a full-blown cryptocurrency economy inside the app, it would also insulate it against the attacks and accusations of nation-states such as Iran, where it now accounts for 40% of Iran¡¯s internet traffic but was temporarily blocked amongst nationwide protests against the government.Telegram has played a delicate political balancing act to try and retain its users in the country, shutting down some channels for calling for the downfall of the government, while keeping others open.With TON, Telegram aims to develop cryptocurrency-based utility akin to WeChat, which has blossomed into much more than a chat app and acts as default payment mechanism for many in China.While payments can be made very quickly in WeChat for a variety of services, the system remains very centralized. A decentralized platform such as TON could offer more security and resilience.Sources say that Telegram plans to allow users to hold both Telegram¡¯s currency and fiat currency in a forthcoming wallet.There¡¯s also the existing developer ecosystem Telegram has built up around it, where bots and services are offered by third-party developers. Again, here TON could, in theory, underly everything a developer brings to Telegram.In a 132 page white paper, Telegram has outlined a four-stage plan:¡°TON Services¡± will be a platform for third-party services of any kind that enables smartphone like friendly interfaces for decentralized apps and smart contracts.¡°TON DNS¡± is a service for assigning human-readable names to accounts, smart contracts services and network nodes. With TON DNS, accessing decentralized services could be like ¡°viewing a website on the World Wide Web.¡±¡°TON Payments¡± is a platform for micropayments and a micropayment channel network. It aims to be used for ¡°instant off-chain value transfers between users bots and other services¡±. Safeguards built into the system are designed to ensure that these transfers ¡°are as secure as on-chain transactions¡±.The ¡°TON Blockchain¡± will consist of a master chain and 2-to-the-power-of-92 accompanying blockchains. Its most notable aspect is that it will have an ¡°Infinite Sharding Paradigm¡± to achieve scalability. Thus, TON blockchains aim to be able to ¡°automatically split and merge to accommodate changes in load¡±. This would mean new blocks are generated quickly and ¡°the absence of long queues helps keep transaction costs low, even if some of the services using the platform become massively popular¡±.It will also consist of ¡°Instant Hypercube Routing¡± designed so the blockchain can maintain top speed even as it grows. Its proof of stake approach will reach consensus through a variant of the ¡®Byzantine Fault Tolerant¡¯ protocol, again increasing speed and efficiency. And it will also use 2-D Distributed Ledgers. This means the TON can grow new valid blocks on top of any blocks that were proven to be incorrect to avoid any unnecessary forks. In other words, TON aims to be ¡®self-healing¡¯.TON¡¯s third generation blockchain will be based on a dynamic ¡®proof of stake¡¯ secured by multiple parties with a high degree of fault tolerance. It will also handle storage of ID, payments and smart contracts. So, instead of relying on proof of work to create its currency, Telegram will rely on a new, less energy-hogging way of mining cryptocurrency than the original Bitcoin method.The claim is that it will be capable of a vastly superior number of transactions, around 1 million per second. In other words, similar to the ambitions of the Polkadot project out of Berlin ? but with an installed base of 180 million people. This makes it an ¡®interchain¡¯ with so-called ¡®dynamic sharding¡¯.The white paper also makes clear that four percent of the supply of Grams (200 million Grams) will be reserved for Telegram¡¯s development team with a four-year vesting period. Telegram also plans to retain ¡°at least 52 percent¡± of the entire supply of the Grams cryptocurrency to protect it from speculative trading and maintain flexibility. The remaining 44 percent will be sold in both the public and private sale.The currency will be listed on external exchanges and used inside the Telegram app.Timing-wise, the first quarter of this year will see the launch of the Telegram External Secure ID, followed by an MVP of TON. The launch of the Telegram Wallet is slated for Q4 2018, and the creation of the TON-based economy could launch in Q1 2019. The rest of the TON Services would follow in Q2 2019.Some in the crypto community remain skeptical of TON.?¡°I just think this is the CEO¡¯s way of monetizing Telegram, basically,¡± says Jackson Palmer, the founder of early cryptocurrency Dogecoin.Durov and his brother Nikolai Durov, a mathematical genius, were behind the creation of VK, ¡°Russia¡¯s Facebook¡±, worth an estimated $3 billion, but were effectively forced to sell their stake in the company by oligarch shareholders deeply connected to the Putin-led government. Although Pavel managed to negotiate an exit with a large payoff, he¡¯s known to have harbored a resentment against outside investors ever since.Pavel reportedly left Russia with $300 million and 2,000 Bitcoins and, after buying a citizenship in St. Kitts and Nevis, splits his time between London, Dubai and, where possible, Russia. Telegram¡¯s move into crypto could give him another shot at a massive fortune, while potentially turning the chat app into a vast payment network protected from government interference."
57,Apps,"A few days ago DraftKings announced an NFL product called Showdown, which lets you play in a fantasy football contest centered around just a single football game.This means that all your players will be drafted from just the two teams playing in that game. Lineups will consist of only six players ? four offensive players and two defensive players.Later today it¡¯s being tested for the first time during the Carolina Panthers and New Orleans Saints playoff game at 4:40pm ET.?And DraftKings plans to continue offering Showdown throughout the NFC and AFC championship game. If it¡¯s well received, don¡¯t be surprised to see DraftKings make it available during the regular season next year, or even expand it to other sports.This new offering is important for a few reasons. First, it allows DraftKings to offer fantasy contests well into the postseason and potentially during the Super Bowl. Before this new offering the company required users to draft NFL lineups with players from multiple games, meaning users couldn¡¯t play on days with only one NFL game, like during the playoffs. In turn DraftKings likely has been missing out on a ton of missed revenue and fan interaction during the time of the season where fans are most into the games.It¡¯s also important because the six-player structure used by Showdown simplifies fantasy sports on DraftKings in general, making it more accessible to casual fans who don¡¯t like spending time perfecting their lineups and just want to casually play to make the game they¡¯re watching more exciting.The single-game format complies with all state laws?passed over the last few years that legislate daily fantasy sports, which all generally just require that contest not be based on the performance of a single team or athlete.Going forward, expect to see more products from DraftKings and other daily fantasy sports providers that continue to simplify game play in an effort to appeal to a broader group of casual sports fans."
58,Apps,"Analyst Gartner put out a 10-strong listicle this week identifying what it dubbed ¡°high-impact¡± uses for AI-powered features on smartphones that it suggests will enable device vendors to provide ¡°more value¡± to customers via the medium of ¡°more advanced¡± user experiences.It¡¯s also predicting that, by 2022, a full 80 per cent of smartphones shipped will have on-device AI capabilities, up from just 10 per cent in 2017.More on-device AI could result in better data protection and improved battery performance, in its view ? as a consequence of data being processed and stored locally. At least that¡¯s the top-line takeout.Its full list of apparently enticing AI uses is presented (verbatim) below.But in the interests of presenting a more balanced narrative around automation-powered UXes we¡¯ve included some alternative thoughts after each listed item which consider the nature of the value exchange being required for smartphone users to tap into these touted ¡®AI smarts¡¯ ? and thus some potential drawbacks too.1)???¡°Digital Me¡± Sitting on the Device¡°Smartphones will be an extension of the user, capable of recognising them and predicting their next move. They will understand who you are, what you want, when you want it, how you want it done and execute tasks upon your authority.¡±¡°Your smartphone will track you throughout the day to learn, plan and solve problems for you,¡± said?Angie Wang, principle research analyst at?Gartner. ¡°It will leverage its sensors, cameras and data to accomplish these tasks automatically. For example, in the?connected home, it could order a vacuum bot to clean when the house is empty, or turn a rice cooker on 20 minutes before you arrive.¡±Hello stalking-as-a-service. Is this ¡®digital me¡¯ also going to whisper sweetly that it¡¯s my ¡®number one fan¡¯ as it pervasively surveils my every move in order to fashion a digital body-double?that ensnares my free will within its algorithmic black box¡¦?Or is it just going to be really annoyingly bad at trying to predict exactly what I want at any given moment, because, y¡¯know, I¡¯m a human not a digital paperclip (no, I am not writing a fucking letter).??Oh and who¡¯s to blame when the AI¡¯s choices not only aren¡¯t to my liking but are much worse? Say?the AI sent the robo vacuum cleaner over the kids¡¯ ant farm when they were away at school¡¦ is the AI also going to explain to them the reason for their pets¡¯ demise? Or what if it turns on my empty rice cooker (after I forgot to top it up) ? at best pointlessly expending energy, at worst enthusiastically burning down the house. We¡¯ve been told that AI assistants are going to get really good at knowing and helping us real soon for a long time now. But unless you want to do something simple like play some music, or something narrow like find a new piece of similar music to listen to, or something basic like order a staple item from the Internet, they¡¯re still far more idiot than savant.?2)???User Authentication¡°Password-based, simple authentication is becoming too complex and less effective, resulting in weak security, poor user experience, and a high cost of ownership. Security technology combined with?machine learning,?biometrics?and user behaviour will improve usability and self-service capabilities. For example, smartphones can capture and learn a user¡¯s behaviour, such as patterns when they walk, swipe, apply pressure to the phone, scroll and type, without the need for passwords or active authentications.¡±More stalking-as-a-service. No security without total privacy surrender, eh? But will I get locked out of my own devices if I¡¯m panicking and not behaving like I ¡®normally¡¯ do ? say, for example, because the AI turned on the rice cooker when I was away and I arrived home to find the kitchen in flames. And will I be unable to prevent my device from being unlocked on account of it happening to be held in my hands ? even though I might actually want it to remain locked in any particular given moment because devices are personal and situations aren¡¯t always predictable.?And what if I want to share access to my mobile device with my family? Will they also have to strip naked in front of its all-seeing digital eye just to be granted access? Or will this AI-enhanced multi-layered biometric system end up making it harder to share devices between loved ones? As has indeed been the case with Apple¡¯s shift from a fingerprint biometric (which allows multiple fingerprints to be registered) to a facial biometric authentication system, on the iPhone X (which doesn¡¯t support multiple faces being registered)? Are we just supposed to chalk up the gradual goodnighting of device communality as another notch in ¡®the price of progress¡¯?3)???Emotion Recognition¡°Emotion sensing systems and?affective computing?allow smartphones to detect, analyse, process and respond to people¡¯s emotional states and moods. The proliferation of?virtual personal assistants?and other AI-based technology for?conversational systems?is driving the need to add emotional intelligence for better context and an enhanced service experience. Car manufacturers, for example, can use a smartphone¡¯s front camera to understand a driver¡¯s physical condition or gauge fatigue levels to increase safety.¡±No honest discussion of emotion sensing systems is possible without also considering what advertisers could do if they gained access to such hyper-sensitive mood data. On that topic Facebook gives us a clear steer on the potential risks ? last year leaked internal documents?suggested the social media giant was touting its ability to crunch usage data to identify feelings of teenage insecurity as a selling point in its ad sales pitches. So while sensing emotional context might suggest some practical utility that smartphone users may welcome and enjoy, it¡¯s also potentially highly exploitable and could easily feel horribly invasive ? opening the door to, say, a teenager¡¯s smartphone knowing exactly when to hit them with an ad because they¡¯re feeling low. If indeed on-device AI means locally processed emotion sensing systems could offer guarantees they would never leak mood data there may be less cause for concern. But normalizing emotion-tracking by baking it into the smartphone UI would surely drive a wider push for similarly ¡°enhanced¡± services elsewhere ? and then it would be down to the individual app developer (and their attitude to privacy and security) to determine how your moods get used.?As for cars, aren¡¯t we also being told that AI is going to do away with the need for human drivers? Why should we need AI watchdogs surveilling our emotional state inside vehicles (which will really just be nap and entertainment pods at that point, much like airplanes).?A major consumer-focused safety argument for emotion sensing systems seems unconvincing.?Whereas government agencies and businesses would surely love to get dynamic access to our mood data for all sorts of reasons¡¦4)???Natural-Language Understanding¡°Continuous training and deep learning on smartphones will improve the accuracy of speech recognition, while better understanding the user¡¯s specific intentions. For instance, when a user says ¡°the weather is cold,¡± depending on the context, his or her real intention could be ¡°please order a jacket online¡± or ¡°please turn up the heat.¡± As an example,?natural-language understanding?could be used as a near real-time voice translator on smartphones when traveling abroad.¡±While we can all surely still dream of having our own personal babelfish ? even given the cautionary warning against human hubris embedded in the biblical allegory to which the concept alludes ? it would be a very impressive AI assistant that could automagically select the perfect jacket to buy its owner after they had casually opined that ¡°the weather is cold¡±. I mean, no one would mind a gift surprise coat. But, clearly, the AI being inextricably deeplinked to your credit card means it would be you forking out for, and having to wear, that bright red Columbia Lay D Down Jacket that arrived (via Amazon Prime) within hours of your climatic observation, and which the AI had algorithmically determined would be robust enough to ward off some ¡°cold¡±, while having also data-mined your prior outerwear purchases to whittle down its style choice. Oh, you still don¡¯t like how it looks? Too bad.??The marketing ¡®dream¡¯ pushed at consumers of the perfect AI-powered personal assistant involves an awful lot of suspension of disbelief around how much actual utility the technology is credibly going to provide ? i.e. unless you¡¯re the kind of person who wants to reorder the same brand of jacket every year and also finds it horribly inconvenient to manually seek out a new coat online and click the ¡®buy¡¯ button yourself. Or else who feels there¡¯s a life-enhancing difference between having to directly ask an Internet connected robot assistant to ¡°please turn up the heat¡± vs having a robot assistant 24/7 spying on you so it can autonomously apply calculated agency to choose to turn up the heat when it overheard you talking about the cold weather ? even though you were actually just talking about the weather, not secretly asking the house to be magically willed warmer. Maybe you¡¯re going to have to start being a bit more careful about the things you say out loud when your AI is nearby (i.e. everywhere, all the time).?Humans have enough trouble understanding each other; expecting our machines to be better at this than we are ourselves seems fanciful ? at least unless you take the view that the makers of these data-constrained, imperfect systems are hoping to patch AI¡¯s limitations and comprehension deficiencies by socially re-engineering their devices¡¯ erratic biological users by restructuring and reducing our behavioral choices to make our lives more predictable (and thus easier to systemize). Call it an AI-enhanced life more ordinary, less lived.5)???Augmented Reality (AR) and AI Vision¡°With the release of iOS 11, Apple included an ARKit feature that provides new tools to developers to make adding?AR?to apps easier. Similarly, Google announced its ARCore AR developer tool for Android and plans to enable AR on about 100 million Android devices by the end of next year. Google expects almost every new Android phone will be AR-ready out of the box next year. One example of how?AR?can be used is in apps that help to collect user data and detect illnesses such as skin cancer or pancreatic cancer.¡±While most AR apps are inevitably going to be a lot more frivolous than the cancer detecting examples being cited here, no one¡¯s going to neg the ¡®might ward off a serious disease¡¯ card. That said, a system that¡¯s harvesting personal data for medical diagnostic purposes amplifies questions about how sensitive health data will be securely stored, managed and safeguarded by smartphone vendors. Apple has been pro-active on the health data front ? but, unlike Google, its business model is not dependent on profiling users to sell targeted advertising so there are competing types of commercial interests at play.And indeed, regardless of on-device AI, it seems inevitable that users¡¯ health data is going to be taken off local devices for processing by third party diagnostic apps (which will want the data to help improve their own AI models) ? so data protection considerations ramp up accordingly. Meanwhile powerful AI apps that could suddenly diagnose?very serious illnesses also raise wider issues around how an app could responsibly and sensitively inform a person it believes they have a major health problem. ¡®Do no harm¡¯ starts to look a whole lot more complex when the consultant is a robot.??6) Device Management¡°Machine learning?will improve device performance and standby time. For example, with many sensors, smartphones can better understand and learn user¡¯s behaviour, such as when to use which app. The smartphone will be able to keep frequently used apps running in the background for quick re-launch, or to shut down unused apps to save memory and battery.¡±Another AI promise that¡¯s predicated on pervasive surveillance coupled with reduced user agency ? what if I actually want to keep an app open that I normally close directly or vice versa; the AI¡¯s template won¡¯t always predict dynamic usage perfectly. Criticism directed at Apple after the recent revelation that iOS will slow performance of older iPhones as a technique for trying to eke better performance out of older batteries should be a warning flag that consumers can react in unexpected ways to a perceived loss of control over their devices by the manufacturing entity.? ?7) Personal Profiling¡°Smartphones are able to collect data for behavioural and personal profiling. Users can receive protection and assistance dynamically, depending on the activity that is being carried out and the environments they are in (e.g., home, vehicle, office, or leisure activities). Service providers such as insurance companies can now focus on users, rather than the assets. For example, they will be able to adjust the car insurance rate based on driving behaviour.¡±Insurance premiums based on pervasive behavioral analysis ? in this case powered by smartphone sensor data (location, speed, locomotion etc) ? could also of course be adjusted in ways that end up penalizing the device owner. Say if a person¡¯s phone indicated they brake harshly quite often. Or regularly exceed the speed limit in certain zones. And again, isn¡¯t AI supposed to be replacing drivers behind the wheel? Will a self-driving car require its rider to have driving insurance? Or aren¡¯t traditional car insurance premiums on the road to zero anyway ? so where exactly is the consumer benefit from being pervasively personally profiled??Meanwhile discriminatory pricing is another clear risk with profiling.?And for what other purposes might a smartphone be utilized to perform behavioral analysis of its owner? Time spent hitting the keys of an office computer? Hours spent lounged out in front of the TV? Quantification of almost every quotidian thing might become possible as a consequence of always-on AI ? and given the ubiquity of the smartphone (aka the ¡®non-wearable wearable¡¯) ? but is that actually desirable? Could it not induce feelings of discomfort, stress and demotivation by making ¡®users¡¯ (i.e. people) feel they are being microscopically and continuously judged just for how they live??The risks around pervasive profiling appear even more crazily dystopian when you look at China¡¯s plan to give every citizen a ¡®character score¡¯ ? and consider the sorts of intended (and unintended) consequences that could flow from state level control infrastructures powered by the sensor-packed devices in our pockets.?8)???Content Censorship/Detection¡°Restricted content can be automatically detected. Objectionable images, videos or text can be flagged and various notification alarms can be enabled. Computer recognition software can detect any content that violates any laws or policies. For example, taking photos in high security facilities or storing highly classified data on company-paid smartphones will notify IT.¡±Personal smartphones that snitch on their users for breaking corporate IT policies sound like something straight out of a sci-fi dystopia. Ditto AI-powered content censorship. There¡¯s a rich and varied (and ever-expanding) tapestry of examples of AI failing to correctly identify, or entirely misclassifying, images ? including being fooled by deliberately adulterated graphics? ? as well a long history of tech companies misapplying their own policies to disappear from view (or otherwise) certain pieces and categories of content (including really iconic and really natural stuff) ? so freely handing control over what we can and cannot see (or do) with our own devices at the UI level to a machine agency that¡¯s ultimately controlled by a commercial entity subject to its own agendas and political pressures would seem ill-advised to say the least. It would also represent a seismic shift in the power dynamic between users and connected devices.?9) Personal Photographing¡°Personal photographing includes smartphones that are able to automatically produce beautified photos based on a user¡¯s individual aesthetic preferences. For example, there are different aesthetic preferences between the East and West ? most Chinese people prefer a pale complexion, whereas consumers in the West tend to prefer tan skin tones.¡±AI already has a patchy history when it comes to racially offensive ¡®beautification¡¯ filters. So any kind of automatic adjustment of skin tones seems equally ill-advised.??Zooming out, this kind of subjective automation is also hideously reductive ? fixing users more firmly inside AI-generated filter bubbles by eroding their agency to discover alternative perspectives and aesthetics. What happens to ¡®beauty is in the eye of the beholder¡¯ if human eyes are being unwittingly rendered algorithmically color-blind??10)????Audio Analytic¡°The smartphone¡¯s microphone is able to continuously listen to real-world sounds. AI capability on device is able to tell those sounds, and instruct users or trigger events. For example, a smartphone hears a user snoring, then triggers the user¡¯s wristband to encourage a change in sleeping positions.¡±What else might a smartphone microphone that¡¯s continuously listening to the sounds in your bedroom, bathroom, living room, kitchen, car, workplace, garage, hotel room and so on be able to discern and infer about you and your life? And do you really want an external commercial agency determining how best to systemize your existence to such an intimate degree that it has the power to disrupt your sleep? The discrepancy between the ¡®problem¡¯ being suggested here (snoring) and the intrusive ¡®fix¡¯ (wiretapping coupled with a shock-generating wearable) very firmly underlines the lack of ¡®automagic¡¯ involved in AI. On the contrary, the artificial intelligence systems we are currently capable of building require near totalitarian levels of data and/or access to data and yet consumer propositions are only really offering narrow, trivial or incidental utility. This discrepancy does not trouble the big data-mining businesses that have made it their mission to amass massive data-sets so they can fuel business-critical AI efforts behind the scenes. But for smartphone users asked to sleep beside a personal device that¡¯s actively eavesdropping on bedroom activity, for e.g., the equation starts to look rather more unbalanced. And even if YOU personally don¡¯t mind, what about everyone else around you whose ¡°real-world sounds¡± will also be being snooped on by your phone, regardless of whether they?like it or not. Have you asked them if they want an AI quantifying the noises they make? Are you going to inform everyone you meet that you¡¯re packing a wiretap??"
59,Apps,"Global app revenue climbed 35 percent in 2017 to reach nearly $60 billion, according to a new report today from app intelligence firm Sensor Tower, which measured paid apps, subscriptions, and in-app purchases across both Apple¡¯s App Store and Google Play. However, Apple is the one pulling in the most revenue, the report found ? at nearly double that of Google Play.Specifically, Sensor Tower pegged App Store revenue at?$38.5 billion last year, compared with an estimated $20.1 billion spent on Google Play. That¡¯s 34.7 percent growth over 2016 for the App Store, compared with 34.2 percent growth for Google Play.Combined, the two app marketplaces total $58.7 billion in 2017, up around 35 percent from 2016¡¯s total of $43.5 billion.Sensor Tower¡¯s numbers are in alignment with Apple¡¯s own figures, announced yesterday. Apple on Thursday said it had a record-breaking holiday season on the App Store with over a billion in revenue, and noted that iOS developers had earned $26.5 billion in 2017 ? an over 30 percent increase from the year prior.$26.5 billion is the money paid out to developers ? after Apple¡¯s 30 percent cut. Sensor Tower¡¯s report looks at estimated gross spending before Apple¡¯s cut, and its findings fall within 1 percent of the actual figure.Some of the increased revenue is likely due to mobile¡¯s growth in emerging markets, as well as Apple¡¯s newer support for in-app subscriptions. But Apple didn¡¯t offer a breakdown as to how the revenue was generated or where. Instead it attempted to tie the growth to things like the App Store¡¯s big makeover and the new crop of AR apps, like Pok?mon Go. Certainly these things helped, but at this scale it¡¯s more about the boom in developing markets, like China and India, that¡¯s contributing to the climb.China, for example, overtook the U.S. in App Store revenue back in 2016; and App Annie more recently attributed Q3 2017¡¯s record app revenue and downloads to several emerging markets, including China, India as well as other?Southeast Asian nations, particularly Vietnam and Indonesia.?Related to emerging markets¡¯ impact on the app stores, first-time app installs across both the App Store and Google Play were also up. The report found that global first-time app installs grew to 91.5 billion in 2017, up around 13.5 percent from the estimated 80.7 billion in 2016.While multiple studies have found that a majority of U.S. consumers today?download zero apps per month on average, this growth rate points to the fact that there¡¯s a lot of potential for new downloads in these emerging markets.This can also be seen in Sensor Tower¡¯s data. It found the growth rate of Google Play app downloads was much larger than the App Store¡¯s, at 16.7 percent versus 6.7 percent, respectively. This is because Android has a higher rate of adoption in developing markets.In total, Google Play saw 64 billion first-time installs to the App Store¡¯s 28 billion.The report finally delved into mobile gaming revenue, which increased 30 percent year-over-year to an estimated $48.3 billion ? or nearly 82 percent of all app revenue. Game downloads were more popular on Google Play, which accounted for 27.2 billion (77%) of the estimated 35.5 billion downloads.More details are here on Sensor Tower¡¯s site."

The lawsuit seeks at least $1.6 billion in damages and injunctive relief."
61,Apps,"The week after Christmas is a lazy one, but the App Store was working overtime. Apple triumphantly announced today that the late holiday season brought in more than a billion dollars in purchases on its mobile marketplace.Indeed, $300 million came in on New Year¡¯s Day alone, presumably as everyone made unwise in-app purchases to get through their hangovers. And $890 million was spent in the week starting Christmas Eve, though, unfortunately, Apple doesn¡¯t break it down further than that.More granular numbers would have been handy, as it would have allowed us to compare them to Sensor Tower¡¯s report that Christmas Day had a total of $196 million in mobile spending, excluding China ? up about 12 percent from last year.Just as a thought exercise: If we were to divide that amount equally throughout the week, that puts Apple at around $126 million on the 25th, leaving $70 million for Google. That¡¯s just spitballing, of course, as Google hasn¡¯t released any data like this, and excluding China tilts the numbers in Apple¡¯s favor.Both companies¡¯ app stores, however, pointed at the holidays¡¯ true winner: Amazon. The Alexa app topped the free charts on both platforms, and Amazon proudly crowed that it had sold out of practically every new Echo device.¡°Millions¡± of devices costing anywhere from $25 to $250 add up to quite a sum, and, of course, the gadgets are little more than perennial reminders to sign up for Prime and buy even more things you don¡¯t need."
62,Apps,"Mapbox, the SoftBank-backed developer of mapping applications that competes with Google Maps,?TomTom and Here, has acquired the developers behind Mapzen¡¯s Valhalla project in a bid to strengthen its navigation toolkits.The acquisition, made as Mapzen was winding down, brings the Valhalla development team in-house for a bargain price that Mapbox chief executive Eric Gunderson declined to disclose.¡°It¡¯s one of those classic things where having a long-term relationship you become close to people and when shit starts going a little sideways, there¡¯s an opportunity,¡± Gunderson told me of the acquisition.Through the work both companies had been doing on the Valhalla open-source project, Mapbox¡¯s developers had been collaborating with the team behind the project for more than a year.Mapping is a critical component of any autonomous technology for self-driving cars, and powers a wide array of advertising services and features on mobile devices.Late last year, Mapbox raised around $164 million from SoftBank to become a credible competitor to Google Maps and Here in autonomous driving and in new arenas like augmented reality. Already companies like Snap, MasterCard, Instacart and Airbnb use the Mapbox SDK for their applications.The access to those users gives Mapbox anonymized telemetry data from an aggregated 200 million users.Echoing a statement Gunderson made last year when the company bought another emerging mapping technology company, Mapdata, he said that the company has 900,000 developers using its SDK in various products, and all of that location data is being fed back to Mapbox to strengthen its mapping tools.Unlike other routing services that pre-compute directions based on information acquired from every road in a given area, the Valhalla toolkit means that routing decisions can be made in real time ? improving efficiency for companies that desperately need it.Delivery services, logistics companies and ride-hailing services see better mapping and routing as a revenue generator. The faster a driver can reach a destination, the faster they¡¯re able to pick up a new fare or make another delivery, which reduces the need for more drivers on the road and increases profits for companies.¡°The world is live updating and that means you need to have a constant sensor network out there,¡± says Gunderson. And unlike Waze and Google Maps, which own the underlying data associated with any use of their tools, Mapbox lets the app developers who use its service keep the data about their customers. All Mapbox wants is the anonymized location.¡°We get anonymous latitude and longitude data back and then stitch that back into the network¡¦ using the sensor network, but the sensor network is your phone,¡± says Gunderson. He said that through the SDK, Mapbox actually has more sensors on the road than almost any other company (Google Maps is till the monster here, through the data they collect with Android).Mapzen¡¯s Valhalla development team¡°This is going to immediately have benefits for some of our OEM auto customers,¡± Gunderson said. ¡°Turn by tun directions with real-time traffic data and a more lightweight footprint (for the application),¡± are all benefits that OEM¡¯s will enjoy, he said. ¡°The data transfer is very light to devices and it¡¯s also super customizable. It will allow the routing network to build more customizable data experiences.¡±"
63,Apps,"Buying event tickets online isn¡¯t a great experience. Sites like Ticketmaster are the default, but are difficult to use and expensive. A startup called Lea wants to offer a more modern experience by combining event search, discovery, seat selection and payment all in a single application that works right in Facebook Messenger.Yes, that¡¯s right ? Lea is a chatbot.And while bots haven¡¯t had the warmest reception as of yet, they¡¯re increasingly becoming a common way for consumers to interact with apps and brands. But in the case of Lea, the chatbot-style interface may actually work better than using a ticketing website or dedicated mobile app, like Ticketmaster¡¯s.According to Lea¡¯s CEO Brian Canty, the original idea ? back when the company was known as?Ticktate ? was to offer a concierge-like application for buying event tickets. Similar to Postmates, the company would send people to the box office to buy tickets on users¡¯ behalf. But this idea didn¡¯t scale, Canty explains. It was expensive and the box offices themselves pushed back because of their deep ties to Ticketmaster.When the company joined 500 Startups in 2016, it was still self-funded, and in search of a model that worked. That is, one that still made it easier to find and buy event tickets while offering users the feel of the ¡°high-touch, hand-holding¡± experience they seemed to like from before, says Canty.Initially, Lea tried building a bot that used natural language processing (NLP, which understands language) to aid with users¡¯ inquires about tickets. But after six months of testing, the team found that the technology on its own wasn¡¯t matching up to user expectations.¡°We decided to pull out all the NLP and just take advantage of the Facebook platform to build something that accompanies the fan throughout the full journey of going to an event,¡± explains Canty. ¡°Everything from discovery ? we pull in their Spotify information, suggest events based on their location and what their friends like ? to a chat extension, Facebook¡¯s feature for allowing people to chat in a group with a bot and make purchases,¡± he says.The bot today works only with Spotify, but the company aims to support Apple Music and SoundCloud in time.It offers users the ability to search for specific artists, bands and concerts, or they can leverage Lea¡¯s discovery mechanisms to stay informed of events they may like. Every week, Lea pushes out an update with around five suggested events and then tracks those you click to improve its future recommendations.When you find an event you like, you can make the purchase right from Messenger or your Messenger group chat, without leaving the app.Every step the user takes in Lea is guided by the bot using prompts, but Lea hopes to add NLP back in to augment the experience in the future.As for the ticket prices, they¡¯re market-based. Lea ? like StubHub, SeatGeek, GameTime and others ? works with third-party ticket exchanges, which price tickets based on their current value. That is, if the event is sold out, they may be higher than the box office; if it¡¯s not, they may be lower. Like competitors, it offers a large database of around 20 million+ tickets.But Lea is hoping to sell consumers on the convenience of the chatbot experience, not necessarily by offering the absolute lowest ticket prices. That will depend on consumer adoption of chatbots in general, which is still a risky bet.It also hopes to entice users by offering the full end-to-end experience in a single place.¡°If you think about a typical ticketing company, discovery is done off-platform ? like a Songkick or Bandsintown,¡± notes Canty. With Lea, the app starts with discovery, lets people plan in group chat as usual, then facilitates the purchase. ¡°But after the purchase, there¡¯s a lot that can still be done in the digital format ? things that can be value-adds,¡± he says.Lea has a lot of plans in that area. It?aims to generate revenue with third-party integrations for things like concessions, parking and merchandise sales in future versions, for example. (Today it only takes a 20 percent cut of ticket sales, so it needs more revenue streams.) It also wants to work with more platforms, like Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, iMessage and SMS, voice platforms and others.Though it¡¯s still early, Lea is seeing some traction, notes Canty.As of the third week in December 2017, the company had sold $500,000 worth of tickets and has grown to 23,000 users. At one point, almost half the users were repeat customers. (But this isn¡¯t always the case ? not everyone goes to concerts all the time, so repeat usage needs to be measured over a longer period of time.)To aid with its development, Lea recently closed on $600,000 in angel funding from a number of notable investors.The list includes Danny Zhang, CTO of Wish; Haroon Mirza, GP of Skyrocket Ventures, investor in SnapTravel; Vito Bialla, Bialla Ventures, investor in Freshly; Chun Han, director of Data Science at Yahoo!; Jeanne Lim, CMO of Hanson Robotics (creators of Sophia Bot); Hao Zheng, CEO of Plus.ai; and Seth Flowerman, investor in Ticketbis.The app is available here for Facebook Messenger."

A user connects their bank accounts and credit cards and then gets personalized advice based on their spending patterns, as well as access to loans to help with fluctuating monthly income and expenses.Essentially, the startup takes the spectrum of financial services that a customer would typically get from 3 or 4 different banks or providers and rebundles them into one app.The round was led by existing investor Edison Partners, who has now invested a total of $27M in MoneyLion.

MoneyLion has a rewards program that gives customers points for doing things like connecting a bank account or keeping their credit utilization low. These points can be redeemed for gift cards and other perks, essentially giving American Express-style rewards to middle class customers who may not have a points-earning credit card.And MoneyLion isn¡¯t only providing financial services to an underserved middle class ? they¡¯re also showing that they can make money while doing it. The startup generates most of its revenue from its loan product ? it¡¯s originated over 250,000 loans to date to a group of 1.5M total users.

65,Apps,"Last October, Facebook extended the usage (and flexibility) of Instagram Stories ? the Snapchat-like feature that lets you patch together photos and videos into a slide show ? by making it easy to directly post a Story to Facebook. Now Facebook is looking at how to bring WhatsApp into the fold.TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that the company is now running a test to let users post their Instagram Stories directly to WhatsApp, as a WhatsApp Status, a corresponding Snapchat-like feature in the latter messaging app where?decorated photos, videos and GIFs can be posted with encryption, disappearing after 24 hours. An Instagram Story posted as a WhatsApp Status also becomes encrypted like the rest of WhatsApp.¡°We are always testing ways to improve the experience on?Instagram?and make it easier to share any moment with the people who matter to you,¡± a spokesperson said.From what we understand, the?feature is currently being tested with a small number of users.It¡¯s based on publicly available code that WhatsApp makes available to integrate WhatsApp messaging with third-party apps on the web or on Android. Users get an option to tap to share to WhatsApp from the Instagram sharing screen, but they still have to press ¡°send¡± in WhatsApp to post the story.The reader who tipped us off on it is based in Brazil, where a local blog has also been reporting several sightings in the wild, one of which (on Android) is pictured here, with the Instagram Story on the left, and the WhatsApp Status cross-posted on the right (note the Instagram icon in the corner).(Coincidentally, the Instagram-Stories-posted-to-Facebook feature was originally?tested in Portugal, another Portuguese-speaking country.)There are a few reasons why Facebook may be interested in making Instagram Stories more shareable, and specifically on WhatsApp.The first of these seems simple enough: it¡¯s to give one more bit of functionality and therefore usage to Instagram Stories, which are already very popular and as of last June were outstripping usage of the Snapchat product they were designed to clone.Facebook tells me that as of last November there were more than 300 million daily active users of Instagram Stories. Adding the ability to share to WhatsApp will give those Stories even more ways of generating traffic, especially in countries where WhatsApp is already hugely popular and outstripping usage of Facebook or its Messenger app.The second reason could be to help spur more usage of WhatsApp Status. This was ostensibly the reason for why Facebook enabled Instagram Story sharing to Facebook, whose own Stories feature I personally never see get used that much and has been described by my colleague Josh as a ghost town. The same isn¡¯t the case for Status, though, which Facebook tells me is seeing similar levels of usage to Instagram Stories, also with more than 300 million DAUs as of November.(The relative popularity of all these apps and features is also one drawback to the cross-posting feature: inevitably, there will be people who use them all, which might lead to people getting bored and annoyed at seeing the same content everywhere they look. Ideally Facebook is also working on a way of calibrating Stories, so that if you¡¯ve already seen one in one app, like Instagram, the same exact thing won¡¯t be popping up for you again in a Facebook Story and then a WhatsApp Status.)The third (and maybe most interesting) reason for testing this feature is that Facebook has been steadily working on ways of not only extending the time spent in specific apps, but also how to better usher people from one Facebook-owned app to another, encouraging usage even when the apps are not open.This has taken some different forms so far. Last May, the company started testing cross-app notifications between Facebook, Messenger and Instagram to alert people to when they had mentions or messages in any of them. Then last month, Facebook launched a click-to-WhatsApp messaging button in Facebook ads, monetizing WhatsApp but not on WhatsApp itself. And there have also various other ¡°regramming¡± tests on iOS.Encouraging Story posting between Instagram and WhatsApp Status is notable because it gives a little more social media spin to WhatsApp, which Facebook acquired in 2014 for $19 billion with the explicit promise that it would stay independent of Facebook. As it happens,?the new feature that¡¯s being tested does bypass Facebook¡¯s flagship apps completely.Together, this could all help Facebook grow its overall engagement and traffic footprint. Conversely, it also could spell one more way to destabilize Snapchat and potentially any other app that has any lesser infrastructure to keep your content getting seen by the people you know, whatever app they happen to be using.We¡¯ll update this post as we learn more."
66,Apps,"Apple announced today it will begin allowing select publishers to?waive the membership fees associated with its App Developer Program. Specifically, the new fee waivers will be offered to?¡°nonprofit organizations, accredited educational institutions, and government entities,¡± says Apple. For starters, the waivers will be available in the U.S., but the company had said in December it plans to make them available to more markets over time.This change originally came about due to the uproar over Apple¡¯s new App Store policies, which banned templated-based apps from the store. The move has drastically impacted small businesses, schools, nonprofits and other organizations from being able to effectively and affordably conduct business on the App Store.In its revised App Store developer guidelines, Apple had said?it would?reject any apps created from ¡°a commercialized template or app generation service.¡±Unfortunately for the small players in this space, templates and third-party services are often how they enter the App Store. They generally don¡¯t have the resources or in-house developer talent to create a custom app from scratch, as Apple would prefer.After developer outcry, media coverage (like ours), and attention from Congress, Apple made a revision to the guidelines to lessen the blow. To be clear, the company still wants nothing to do with templated apps. Instead, it thinks apps should offer something more than what you could access on the mobile web ? they should be a different, unique experience.This position makes sense in terms of removing the ¡°clutter¡± from the App Store and sets a quality bar for developers to meet, which in turn ensures a quality experience for consumers. But it also ignores the fact that apps are the primary way mobile users access the internet. For example,?2017 data from Flurry showed that?mobile browser usage dropped from 20 percent in 2013 to just 8 percent in 2016, with the rest of mobile users¡¯ time spent in apps.To help make its demands for ¡°un-templated¡± apps more palatable, Apple rewrote the guidelines to carve out exceptions and clarify things further.??It said that apps with a ¡°picker¡± model (like a restaurant finder) were still acceptable. And it said that app template providers were no longer allowed to submit apps on behalf of their small business clients or other organizations ? like nonprofits, schools, and government entities.To make sure Apple wasn¡¯t unduly impacting this non-business customer base, Apple said it would begin waiving the?$99 Apple Developer Program membership fee in ¡°early 2018.¡±?That day has now arrived.To have the fee waived, qualifying organizations and institutions can submit a fee waiver, after they¡¯ve enrolled in the developer program (if they hadn¡¯t already). The fee waiver will request information that includes the EIN/tax ID issued by the IRS, the Apple ID, and the organization¡¯s D?U?N?S Number (to verify its identity and legal status).Apple says the organization must also be a legal entity ? it will not accept?DBAs, fictitious businesses, trade names, or branches.?This is, in part, because Apple was concerned about how the app templating providers were submitting apps on behalf of clients. That meant the businesses whose apps were in the App Store weren¡¯t actually reading through Apple¡¯s terms or binding themselves in legal agreements.In addition, Apple says the person enrolling the app into the developer program must also have the legal authority to do so. That is, they need to be the?organization¡¯s owner/founder, executive team member, senior project lead, or have legal authority granted to you by a senior employee, says Apple. Again, this is because Apple wants to establish a direct relationship with all its app publishers.The fee waiver is available to existing organizations whose apps are already live, too. This will allow them to waive the fee when it comes up for annual renewal going forward. However, no refunds ? full or partial ? will be offered, says Apple."
67,Apps,"Apple continues to ramp up its efforts to court developers by making it easier to create and iterate their apps for its platforms. The iPhone giant has now acquired Buddybuild, a Vancouver-based app tools startup that?describes itself as ¡°mobile iteration platform¡± focused on continuous integration and debugging tools ? essentially giving an app development team a simple workflow for iterating and pushing their apps out into the world through GitHub, BitBucket or GitLab.Apple confirmed the acquisition directly to us, and the startup also noted the move in a blog post this afternoon.No financial terms have been disclosed for the deal.?Apple tells TechCrunch that the team (currently employing around 40 or so engineers) will stay put in BC, a fact that the startup celebrated by noting that it¡¯s ¡°always been proud to be a Canadian company.¡±?As part of the acquisition, Buddybuild will be rolled into Xcode, Apple¡¯s suite of development tools for iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS, although Apple and Buddybuild have not given a specific timeline of when that will happen.?Buddybuild¡¯s service?will continue to be available to existing customers as a standalone product through the company¡¯s site ? though new customers will no longer be accepted through that portal, beginning today. But the deal also means the effective end of the Android app development that the company added last February. That aspect of the service will be sunset in March. Apple similarly discontinued Android compatibility when it acquired TestFlight, effectively removing a key development tool from Google¡¯s ecosystem.?The system should fit nicely into Apple¡¯s existing set of tools, bringing additional methods for testing, debugging and deploying mobile apps through a proprietary channel. More to the point, it should make developing and iterating apps for iOS that much easier than before. Apps are a key battleground for smartphone makers: they lure users to buy their devices, and when the pace of smartphone acquisition slows down as markets mature, apps increasingly become a revenue stream in their own right. Apple, whose iPhones have long been outstripped by devices powered by Google¡¯s Android in terms of market share, still generates considerably more revenue from apps than the latter. Of the $17 billion generated in Q3 from apps globally (excluding China), Apple accounted for around $11 billion of it, according to App Annie.But with Google outstripping Apple in downloads, you can see some of the math that might lead Apple to making sure its platform and app tools remain developer-friendly and replete with new features and tools to make it easier to use.The move echoes Apple¡¯s acquisition of TestFlight back in 2014, which began to require users to employ Xcode to utilize the service.??Buddybuild was founded in 2015 by former Amazon employees Dennis Pilarinos and Christopher Stott. In its nearly three years of existence, the startup has managed to raise around $8.8 million, including a $7.6 million Series A led by Kleiner Perkins Caufield back in May of 2016.Stewart Butterfield has served as an advisor for the company, and Slack has become one of its more prominent clients. The remaining roster of existing customers is an impressive one, including Mozilla, Hootsuite, Reddit, SoundCloud, FourSquare and The New York Times.Buddybuild added in its blog post that Vancouver has become something of a hotbed for software development, and adding Apple¡¯s extra cache should make local recruitment even easier if the company does decide to grow.Additional reporting by Ingrid Lunden"
68,Apps,"There may be a reason why that ol¡¯ ¡°Facebook is listening to you talk¡± conspiracy theory refuses to die ? and not just because Facebook¡¯s ad technology has gotten so good, it¡¯s downright creepy. As it turns out, some apps are actually listening. Well, kind of! According to a recent report from The NYT, a number of apps using software from a company called Alphonso use the smartphone¡¯s microphone to listen for audio signals in TV ads and programs, then sometimes even connect that data with places you visit or the movies you go see.The NYT¡¯s report found that over 250 games using Alphonso software were available in Google Play, and some were also found in Apple¡¯s App Store. Some of the apps were games and others were aimed at children.Apptopia, an app intelligence firm that¡¯s tracking Alphonso¡¯s software distribution as well, says it¡¯s only now seeing 106 apps on Google Play and 24 on the App Store, with the exception of any paid apps and those that require iOS 11.While Alphonso¡¯s software is not exactly the same situation as that ongoing Facebook meme ? the one that has a number of people convinced Facebook is listening to their verbal conversations in order to target ads ? it is an indication that surreptitious audio technology like this is at least possible. And that further fuels the conspiracy.There are some differences between what Alphonso is doing and what Facebook is continually accused of, however. Alphonso¡¯s software is not focused on recording your personal conversations, the company told The NYT. Instead, it¡¯s listening for audio signals emitted by the TVs in order to track viewing behavior. This data, in turn, can be sold to advertisers.The technology here is very similar to other software?the FTC warned about in 2016.?It had then alerted app developers using Silverpush¡¯s software that they could?be in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act, if they said they weren¡¯t collecting or transmitting this same sort of TV data when, in fact, they do. The FTC also pointed out that the apps in question weren¡¯t telling users that they were monitoring their TV viewing habits even when the app wasn¡¯t in use.The case with Alphonso¡¯s software sounds suspiciously similar. It serves as yet another reminder to be careful of what you install on your phone, and to carefully review an app¡¯s permissions ? especially if it¡¯s asking for access to something it shouldn¡¯t require, like a game that needs to turn on your microphone, for example.Thankfully, today¡¯s app stores operated by Apple and Google require apps get user consent when an app wants to tap into the microphone. On apps distributed by the iOS App Store, there¡¯s even a dedicated pop-up that forces you to agree to the microphone usage when the app first runs.Additionally, you can check where?you¡¯ve consented to microphone use in apps for yourself. In iOS Settings, go to Privacy ?> Microphone; on modern Android, go to Apps & notifications ?> App Permissions, then Microphone.However, no matter how the consent information is presented, it¡¯s often quickly agreed to ? in some cases, even by children. Plus, it¡¯s just not clear to many consumers that an app will continue to be listening even when their phone is not being used and stowed away in their pocket, for example. (Alphonso¡¯s software can work in a pocket, too, The NYT said.)At least the FTC historically hasn¡¯t looked too kindly on companies that try to slip this sort of behavior past consumers. Early in 2017, for instance, it fined Vizio $2.2 million for collecting viewing history from 11 million smart TVs with proper consumer consent, for example."
69,Apps,"Messaging app Telegram and Facebook-owned social sharing platform Instagram appear to be being blocked in Iran.Iran state TV said yesterday that authorities were temporarily blocking the services to ¡°maintain peace¡±, according to the AP news agency.The country has seen a rising wave of anti-government protests in recent days and ministers have accused social media of fueling dissent.On Saturday Iran¡¯s ICT minister, Mohammad-Javad?Azari Jahromi tweeted directly at Telegram founder Pavel Durov ? claiming that one of the platform¡¯s channels ¡°is encouraging hateful conduct, use of Molotov cocktails, armed uprisings, and social unrest¡± and urging Durov to act to ¡°stop such encouragements via Telegram¡±.@Durov: A Telegram channel is encouraging hateful conduct, use of Molotov cocktails, armed uprising, and social unrest. NOW is the time to stop such encouragements via Telegram.? MJ Azari Jahromi (@azarijahromi) December 30, 2017In a post on his Telegram channel yesterday, Durov said the authorities had ¡°imposed a block on Telegram¡±, adding that it is ¡°not clear whether permanent or temporary¡±.He also confirmed that Telegram admins had suspended the channel that Jahromi had been objecting to ? naming it as @amadnews ? but claimed this was as a result of the channel admins having broken Telegram¡¯s terms of service rules by?¡°calling its subscribers to use Molotov cocktails and firearms against police¡±.Responding to?Jahromi¡¯s?earlier tweet?Durov also noted that:?¡°Calls for violence are prohibited by the Telegram rules. If confirmed, we¡¯ll have to block such a channel, regardless of its size and political affiliation.¡±Following the suspension of @amadnews, Durov writes that the channel admins were able to ¡°reassemble most of their subscribers (800,000) in a new peaceful channel, which we welcomed¡± ? after apologizing for breaking Telegram¡¯s ToS and pledging ¡°not to promote violence in future¡±.At the time of writing neither Instagram nor Telegram could be reached for comment.Telegram has a large user base in Iran ? with Durov stating last year that it has ~40M monthly active users, which amounts to around half the population of the country, and 25M daily active users.With media censorship a fact of life in Iran, digital services and apps such as Telegram have offered citizens an alternative outlet for accessing information ? including, when service blocks are imposed, the capacity for more tech savvy users to use other digital tools (such as proxy servers) to circumvent attempts to restrict access to uncensored content.However the Iranian government has been pushing for control over foreign messaging platforms ? including, in 2016, calling for companies to move their servers to Iran, sparking privacy fears.Last year Durov was forced to?deny?that Telegram had moved some of its servers to the country ? saying rather it had installed some local caching nodes to speed up download times.The local CDNs could not in any way aid state censorship of the platform, he asserted.Iran¡¯s government has also been targeting Telegram channel administrators ? issuing a requirement that admins of channels with more than 5,000 members register with the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance.Those not registering risk?prosecution. While registered admins expose themselves to the risk of arrest?? putting channels under greater pressure to self-censor.The regime also appears to be cranking up the public pressure on Durov to police content it doesn¡¯t like ? such as the now suspended @amadnews channel ? though the Telegram founder has been quick to point to counter-examples where the platform has resisted authorities¡¯ demands.Iranian authorities are blocking access to Telegram for the majority of Iranians after our public refusal to shut down https://t.co/9E4kXZYcP9 and other peacefully protesting channels.? Pavel Durov (@durov) December 31, 2017Whether Telegram can continue?to walk this line and successfully avoid a permanent block in Iran remains to be seen. (The Indonesian government used blocks last summer to wring content-related concessions out of Telegram, focused on removing ISIS-related channels and improving its local moderation systems.)Telegram¡¯s actions here, in suspending a popular channel following a state request, have drawn accusations of collusion with the Iranian regime, even as the platform continues to anger the Iranian government by providing an ongoing outlet for uncensored political content.So Durov looks to be facing the proverbial choice between a rock and a hard place ? leaving his critics to decry his technical choices.You can't keep an independent, destabilizing service from being blocked in authoritarian regimes, you can only delay it. So you need to be thinking about how to continuing protecting people by making the service accessible *even after the block.*? Edward Snowden (@Snowden) December 30, 2017"
70,Apps,"You might have noticed a new end-of-year trend on Instagram the past few days. If so, you can thank 2017bestnine.com, a website that lets you automatically collect and collage your most-liked photos of 2017.Best Nine has been around for a while, so many of you may be familiar with the tool already. But for those of you who are new to that Best Nine game, here¡¯s how it works.First of all, your Instagram profile must be public for this to work, so if you have it set to private, quickly switch it to public to allow Best Nine to get in there and do its magic. Once your profile is public, head to 2017 Best Nine and input your Instagram ID.After a few seconds (or minutes, depending on traffic to the site), the Best Nine service will offer you options for your final collaged photo that includes your best nine photos from 2017.The ¡®original version¡¯ includes a caption that says ¡°Thank you for your likes!¡± with the hashtag #2017bestnine at the top. You can also choose the photo only version or check out your best nine from 2016.The final version looks something like this:And with that, 2017 is nearly over. Happy New Year, everyone!"
71,Apps,"It¡¯s been pretty easy to point at Twitter and, with each quarterly moment when it discloses its financial guts, let out a long exasperated sigh.Twitter since going public at a now in retrospect astounding valuation has for much of its public life been quite the disappointment to Wall Street. But then something interesting happened in the back half of 2017: it went on a rather spectacular run, and though ending on a?bit of a slump, it looks like it could finish the year up more than 25 percent ? which, by Twitter terms, is pretty good.Much of that is thanks to a?(finally) good report in October this year and a blessing from a Wall Street firm, but we could potentially chalk up?getting to those events to some actual things Twitter has done. The product updates haven¡¯t been absolutely transformative (like the earth-shattering bump to a 280-character limit?per tweet), but since the introduction of the algorithmic timeline last year, it would seem that Twitter is getting slightly less allergic to changes to its core product ? even if it alienates part of its very loud user base.Twitter has also seemingly begun taking more action when it comes to enforcing new rules around harassment and abuse, a problem that has been hounding the company for years and is even more visible this year. Earlier this month it said it would begin enforcing new rules around how it handles hateful conduct and abusive behavior. Twitter¡¯s strategy here has been often opaque, and while it¡¯ll take a while to reach some kind of middle ground, it¡¯s actually?doing stuff.And?doing stuff, it seems, is currently enough for Twitter to figure out how to get a nice up-and-to-the-right-ish chart like this one:While these stocks ? especially volatile ones ? will swing often, sometimes the general idea is to try to gauge the future potential of the company. For Twitter, that means it¡¯s going to have to figure out a way to re-ignite growth and get users coming back and using the platform. It has some very deep core issues,?and sometimes seems to flip-flop on its own actions and have troubles communicating. But if Twitter is somehow able to right this ship, it may have an opportunity to get that growth engine moving again.Most executives will probably give the boilerplate ¡°we are committed to delivering long-term value for shareholders¡± argument for stock swings in the near term, but those swings are really significant for the company. It¡¯s the closest thing to a near-term public barometer for the company¡¯s success, which means it does a lot for employee morale. And it also can be significant for attracting talent, as the company may need to offer more generous compensation packages to rip people away from companies that are high-growth or well-established.Twitter, going forward, it appears, needs to keep?doing stuff. It¡¯s made a lot of moves in the video space in addition to building business tools ? like a video-centric ad format. And it certainly has done that to some extent, trying to extend its pitch as a real-time communications platform to video. It needs to continue cracking down on harassment and abuse if it¡¯s going to attract new, more casual users. It needs to keep making tweaks to its products even under the risk of alienating some of its users to make it more user-friendly. In short, there¡¯s a lot of?stuff to be done.What¡¯s arguably the richest part of this whole story, however, is that Twitter now has roughly the same market cap as Snap following its back-of-the-year run. Hovering at around $18 billion, it¡¯s the tale of two runs here: Twitter found some way to turn its story around, and Snap is still having some pretty dramatic issues telling its story to Wall Street. Both have the specter of user growth over them, but somehow Twitter has been able to at least throw a rock in the opposite direction to get the attention of investors temporarily.Will Twitter get its wish of finally escaping the MAU? Probably not. But for now, it looks like Dorsey and the rest of them have figured out at least some small way to sell the promise of Twitter to Wall Street and get them on board for the time being."

73,Apps,"OKCupid¡¯s users are angry ? very, very angry. Just ahead of the new year, the company made a radical change to its policies, and now requires people to use real names instead of an OKCupid username, as before. The change eliminates one of the biggest differentiators between the dating app and rivals like Tinder and Bumble, which have users log in via Facebook in order to use their real name on their dating profile.Since the update, announced last week, OKCupid¡¯s app has been slammed with bad reviews on the App Store. Over half the reviews (56.3%) for the month of December have only one star ? up from around a third in November. That would give the app a dismal 2.2 star rating if only the reviews for the past month were on display in the App Store. (Apple, though, now lets developers choose to not have their ratings reset when they launch a new version; OKC has selected this option to maintain its 4.2 star rating instead.)The company explained the reasoning behind the change in a cheeky blog post which made fun of the silly usernames people have adopted on its site over the years, like?DoritoprincessXO,?DaddyzPrincess29,?StayingPawwsitive, Dootdootledootd0, Britney__Tears,?laidback___stu,?BigDaddyFlash916, and unicorn__jizz, for example. (OKC said these were, in fact, real usernames people had used on its service, but were edited slightly to protect people¡¯s privacy.)It also tied the switch to the end of an era for usernames ? noting that AIM recently shut down for good. The suggestion, basically, was that maybe the time for goofy online handles has ended as well.These aren¡¯t good enough explanations for many of OKCupid¡¯s users, and frankly, they¡¯re a bit dismissive as to why people chose OKC in the first place.As some reviewers have pointed out, the combination of the real name policy and OKC¡¯s push into discovery via features that aims to find nearby matches by shared interests ? could mean less privacy for its users.After all, armed with a name, age, photo, and city, it¡¯s fairly trivial these days to search for the person in question via Google or Facebook and find out who they are, where they work, and where they live. That¡¯s not information all dating app users want to immediately give out to people who are otherwise strangers.¡°Some of us prefer the privacy of individual user names,¡± writes one angry user, ¡®UniqueTwain,¡¯ in an App Store review. ¡°When it comes to my name I would prefer someone get to know me and simply ask. It¡¯s not like I go to a party with my nickname or a name badge or monogrammed clothing on. No, I have to talk to people and get to know them and let them tell me their name. Why should it be any different online?¡±Several others pointed out in their App Store reviews and blog post comments that OKCupid¡¯s announcement had come across as ¡°condescending,¡± ¡°rude,¡± and ¡°patronizing.¡±The company may have cherry-picked some of the more cringeworthy usernames to poke fun at, but many felt that usernames were generally an easy and quick way to get a feel for what someone was like, while still protecting their privacy.There¡¯s also a general sense that OKCupid is trying to become too much like Tinder instead of keeping the features that made it unique. For example, the app has discontinued things people liked, such as the ability to see visitors, as it increased its focus on Tinder-esque features like the prominence given to user photos.¡°Match.com should just shutter OKCupid at this point ? they already own Tinder, no need to build a second Tinder,¡± scoffed tby77 in another App Store review. (Match is the parent company to a number of dating apps, including OKCupid, Tinder, PlentyofFish, and others.)To make matters worse, OKCupid locked some people out of the app until they complied with the new policy, rather than offering a grace period.Others were angry because they had recently paid nearly $50 to OKC to have the ability to change their username by way a premium upgrade. (The only way to have this option at the time.) They aren¡¯t getting a refund, even though the name change feature is now being handed out freely.Though the reviews are brutal, OKC¡¯s App Store ranking hasn¡¯t really been impacted yet by this change (it¡¯s #53 in Social Networking on iOS). That may be because Apple¡¯s rankings only take into account app installs and velocity of those installs ? it doesn¡¯t know how many people are deleting the app.There is at least one caveat to OKC¡¯s new policy ? you don¡¯t have to use your legal name, the company notes at the bottom of its announcement. It says, you can use the name you¡¯d like your date ¡°to call you¡± instead.It later tried to further clarify this in a tweet, explaining that nicknames or even initials are permitted, and that full first names aren¡¯t necessary.We love our members. You do not need to use your government name or even your full first name. Use the name, nickname, or initials you¡¯d like your date to call you on OkCupid.? OkCupid (@okcupid) December 22, 2017But wait¡¦Nicknames? Initials?If OKCupid isn¡¯t actually requiring real names, why kill the username policy at all?Update, 4 PM ET:?OKCupid provided the following statement in response to our questions about the policy change. And by statement, we mean they wrote another blog post:To give you some more background as to why we made the decision to remove usernames ? this is a part of our mission to add more substance and depth to dating. OkCupid wants to make the experience more personal. Having a name adds more of a human element versus a ¡®username¡¯.In response to the ¡®workarounds¡¯ we have stated that in order to qualify as a name it just has to be two letters minimum, no numbers or symbols. We also have a list of banned words that would not qualify. It¡¯s important to clarify that this does not need to be your real/legal name, it can be any name that you want someone to call you.We don¡¯t have any plans to bring usernames back. We know some folks don¡¯t like that usernames are going away but we get many (thousands!) of messages from folks who say they are offended by some of the usernames people make¡¦or they just have a really really hard time coming up with one and can we help them create something that incorporates dinosaurs, tacos or pizza and ideally all three. Or they came up with a seriously awesome user name, and now they forgot it and can we please help them recover it. And we get thousands of requests to change their username because it doesn¡¯t feel like the right thing anymore.We are about safety and security of our users more than anything. That¡¯s why we were the first dating app to introduce the Dating Pledge earlier this year. That¡¯s why we have an incredible moderation team that personally reviews any issues and gets rid of folks that violate our rules.Since we¡¯ve made the change, we¡¯ve heard from lots of people that it makes OkCupid a bit more human. And isn¡¯t that the right move for a dating app?"
74,Apps,"Consumers spent $196 million on apps, in-app purchases and subscriptions on Christmas Day 2017 across the App Store and Google Play, according to new data from Sensor Tower. The report, while excluding Android revenue in China, represents a 12.3 percent increase over last year¡¯s spending of approximately $174 million.That speaks to a still-growing market for apps and games as well as the potential for developers to generate new revenue streams by way of subscriptions sold through their apps. In fact, the recent App Store trend of pixel art coloring books were all fueled by subscriptions, whereas in the past, apps of that nature would charge one-time fees for unlocking premium content.The report also notes that non-game apps saw a higher growth rate than mobile games, with approximately 66 percent year-over-year growth compared with 5.2 percent for apps. However, games are still raking in the most money, going from $150 million in 2016 to $158 million in 2017. Non-games, meanwhile, climbed $14 million from $24 million to $38 million.The revenue generated by the non-game category comes in large part from streaming apps ? like Netflix and HBO NOW. Consumers in 2017 spent a whopping 98 percent more on Entertainment apps versus the same time last year, says Sensor Tower. And of the $38 million spent in non-games, the firm estimates that $9.5 million came from Entertainment apps, up from $4.8 million last year.The rise in Entertainment app spending is not all that surprising, for anyone who¡¯s been following the app economy in recent years. The HBO NOW app, for example, has been a top streaming app by revenue for the past couple of years. In addition, other Entertainment streaming apps like Netflix, Spotify, and Pandora were last year¡¯s biggest apps by revenue.Taking stock of App Store revenue and trends on Christmas Day is a good way to get a glimpse into what the year ahead will bring, as so many consumers are activating new devices, installing apps, and buying apps, games and subscriptions.Sensor Tower¡¯s data follows a report this fall from App Annie, which saw global app revenue and downloads in Q3 hitting record levels of $17 billion and 26 billion, respectively, thanks in large part to emerging markets¡¯ adoption of the smartphone. App Annie doesn¡¯t foresee the market slowing down anytime soon, either. It¡¯s currently forecasting?that worldwide downloads will reach nearly 240 billion and consumer spend will top $100 billion by 2021."
75,Apps,"Instagram¡¯s feed will now show users recommended posts ? a change that earlier this month was spotted while in testing, and has since quietly gone live. The feature, described here in the company¡¯s Help documentation, will suggest posts for you based on those that have been liked by other accounts you follow.The new section, ¡°Recommended for You,¡± is clearly labeled so as not to be confused with your own home feed. It will contain three to five suggested posts, we¡¯re told.This isn¡¯t the first time Instagram has offered recommended content. But previously, you¡¯d have to head to the Explore section to see recommended posts and videos ? they wouldn¡¯t be pushed to your home feed. You could also see what posts friends have been liking in the Following section, if you chose.The injection of recommended content is a fairly big change for Instagram¡¯s feed ? perhaps one of the largest since the switch from the chronological feed to the algorithmic one, or the introduction of ads. It means users scrolling through their home feed will now no longer only see posts from accounts they directly follow alongside the ads. They¡¯ll see things from their wider network, too ? not entirely different from Facebook¡¯s new Explore feed, in fact.The change comes shortly after another update also focused on broadening users¡¯ access to content beyond what¡¯s being posted to those accounts you explicitly follow. Earlier this month, the company introduced a way to allow users to follow hashtags ? in other words, you can now follow your interests, not just accounts.But unlike the hashtags feature, which is opt in (as you choose if you want to track hashtags and, if so, which ones), you can¡¯t really disable the new recommendations.As the Help documentation explains, you can only choose to temporarily hide the ¡°Recommended for You¡± section. This is done by tapping the three-dot menu above the post, then tapping on ¡°Hide.¡±The good news is that the ¡°Recommended for You¡± section is not meant to displace the content you care about in favor of Instagram¡¯s own suggestions. Rather, the section will appear after you¡¯ve viewed all the posts in your feed, an Instagram spokesperson explains, while confirming the feature¡¯s public launch to TechCrunch.But even still, its appearance has irked some users, who prefer the classic experience ? including, in many cases, the chronological feed.No Instagram I don't want ""recommended posts"" on my feed.

78,Apps,"I find it truly sad the way Facebook has led us to reduce wishing friends a happy birthday to a meaningless, generic chore. It¡¯s not Facebook¡¯s fault. It gives us an open-ended comment box. But our laziness and sense of social obligation unfurl as a pile of ¡°Happy Birthday!¡± or even ¡°HBD!¡± wall posts.I¡¯ve been bashing this emergent behavior since 2011. It¡¯s one of the reasons people feel like Facebook is destroying the meaning of friendship. Some go so far as to change the date of their birthday or close their wall to avoid the contentless notifications. Some might say posting ¡°HBD¡± or another simple nicety is better than nothing, but it¡¯s so easy to be more heartfelt.That¡¯s why I think the latest Facebook status update meme going around should be repurposed for birthdays. Dozens of friends recently posted ¡°If you¡¯re reading this, even if we barely talk,?comment?a?memory?of us.?After, make this your status because you¡¯d be surprised the memories people hold of you.¡±It¡¯s cute, no doubt, often inviting a flurry of touching stories, torrid tales and silly photos. But it also feels a bit ¡°extra¡± (no offense). I¡¯m sure plenty of people have declined to repost the call to action for fear of appearing needy or like they¡¯re pandering for engagement.After all, Facebook recently told business Pages admins they¡¯d be downranked in the News Feed for posting this kind of ¡°engagement bait¡± because the comments trick the algorithm into thinking a post is more important than it is.So rather than making people coerce us into sharing our memories together, let¡¯s give them freely. Next time you go to post on someone¡¯s wall for their birthday, take that extra second to recall a moment you shared together or something specific you love about them. Social media doesn¡¯t have to stunt our humanity."
79,Apps,"Amazon¡¯s claims that the Echo Dot was the retailer¡¯s best-selling product all through this holiday season appear to be backed up by the rise of the Alexa app in the U.S. App Store. The companion app for Alexa-powered devices like the Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Show and Echo Spot, grabbed the number one spot for the first time ever on Apple¡¯s App Store on Christmas, and remains there today.Amazon had said yesterday that the Echo Dot was the top-selling device from any manufacturer across all categories on Amazon.com over the holidays, with millions of units sold. The device, along with Echo Spot and Echo Buttons also sold out, leaving customers to place their name on pre-order lists that will be fulfilled ¡°soon,¡± the retailer noted.This demand for Alexa devices has contributed to the Alexa app¡¯s rapid climb from rankings in the 60¡¯s through 90¡¯s earlier this month to the number one position on Christmas Day as Echo owners set up their smart speaker for the first time.The app¡¯s climb also points to only new Alexa device owners, as the app serves no other purpose but to work with the smart speaker. Plus, an existing Echo owner adding an additional device to their home network would have the app already installed on their phone ? they wouldn¡¯t be downloading it again, to give it a rankings boost like this.Grabbing the App Store¡¯s top spot on Christmas is notable as it points to a consumer trend that¡¯s taking place en masse. Last Christmas, the highest ranking the Alexa app was able to achieve was No. 4, according to data from Sensor Tower.While the app hit number one in the U.S. this year, it fared well in other markets where Echo speakers are available, too. In the U.K., the app hit No. 2 and in both Germany and Austria it climbed to No. 5. That points to a global holiday trend were people were buying Alexa-powered smart speakers in greater numbers.For comparison¡¯s sake, the companion app for Google Home smart speakers rose from No. 38 on Christmas Eve to No. 6 on the U.S. App Store (and No. 21 to 6 on Google Play). However, this doesn¡¯t necessarily point to a spike in Google Home smart speaker sales as the app also works with Chromecast.In other words, Christmas gift-giving may have allowed Amazon to further solidify its lead in the smart speaker market, despite the increased competition from Google, which has released the Google Home Mini, and the new, high-end Google Home Max?to complement its original speaker.Alexa devices were already quite a bit ahead in the U.S., however, even without the holiday bump. A November Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) report said that 20 million Amazon Echo smart speakers had been sold in the U.S., compared with 7 million Google Home devices, for example. It also suggested a market share of 74 percent for Amazon to 26 percent for Google."
80,Apps,"NSA Whistleblower Edward Snowden is among the backers of a new surveillance app that helps guard against computer hijackings.Haven is an open source app that will run on any Android phone, particularly inexpensive and older devices. It operates like a surveillance system, using the device¡¯s camera, audio recording capability and even?accelerometer to detect movement and notify a user. The idea is that, even with the best encryption in the world, a device is vulnerability to physical, in-person tampering ? also known as ¡°evil maid¡± because literally a hotel maid could access it.The app was developed by?The Guardian Project, Freedom Of The Press?and Snowden to offer eyes and ears to prevent, or at least increase awareness, of whether a device has been tampered with.So, for example, you¡¯d set up a burner Android device in a hotel safe alongside your laptop. Haven could then be set to broadcast any audio or movement, basically if anyone opened the safe it will snap a photo, record audio and detect motion. Alerts can be sent via SMS, Signal or to a Tor-based website.Writing for The Intercept,?Micah Lee, a member of?Freedom Of The Press who help set up and test the app, admitted that the app does have some shortcomings ? such as maintaining constant internet access for notifications, preventing battery drain and false positives ? but it offers something new for those who would welcome the peace of mind from additional surveillance. While beyond helping keep hardware secure, it could also have other uses.¡°Haven can also be used as a cheap home or office security system to detect break-ins or vandalism while you¡¯re away, positioning the phone to send you photographs when someone walks within range. Or you can use it to monitor for wildlife in rural areas, or to capture evidence of human rights violations and disappearances,¡± Lee wrote.Or even something more festive¡¦""When the lead developer explained the project to his young children, they found another use for it: 'We¡¯re going to catch Santa!'

82,Apps,"Has your kid bugged you to let them download Sandbox Coloring? You¡¯re probably not alone. The latest trend blowing up on the App Store is a new twist on the coloring book apps that have been popular for a couple of years. Now, instead of having users pick and choose their colors as before, this new group of coloring book apps ? four of which recently snagged spots in the App Store¡¯s Top 10 ? are color-by-number books featuring retro-looking, pixel art designs.Also unlike the previous lineup of coloring book apps, which were often marketed as ¡°coloring books for adults,¡± the pixel art books appear to be an App Store trend driven by kids.For starters, they¡¯re coloring books ? and while grown-ups have gotten in on that action in recent years, it¡¯s a type of app that also largely appeals to children.The pixel art coloring apps come up at the top of the App Store search results, when someone looks for keywords like ¡°coloring¡± or ¡°coloring book¡± ? search terms kids are likely to enter.More importantly, a signal the trend may be driven by a younger audience is that the new downloads appear to be coming from word-of-mouth, in many cases. This is mentioned repeatedly in the App Store reviews, where users say their friend told them about the app.You can get a sense of the age of the user base by reading the App Store reviews, as well.Clearly, a number of kids have shared their opinions on the matter of pixel art coloring, as in this sampling of reviews:¡°My name is boobs I love boobs¡±or¡°Hello this is my favorite game I hope you make other games like this you guys are the best game makers¡±?or¡°Have u ever had a McChicken¡±or¡°I love this game so much! I play it in school, at my house, in the car. What I thought you could add is where you can take a pucture and slide a bar from hard witch would have lots of number/blocks and easy witch less numbers/block. I love the new search bar. Plz add my idea¡±or¡°This app is so good you should get it rate it a 5555555 that¡¯s what I did??????????????????????????????????????????it¡±Just going out on a limb here, but these users are probably children.And the kids can download.In December, four apps hit the top 10 on the App Store, including Sandbox Coloring, Pixel Art ? Color by Number, UNICORN ? Number Coloring Book, and Color by Number: Coloring Book.According to data from Sensor Tower, the top four pixel art coloring apps have a combined 12 million downloads ? half of which are from the U.S. alone ? since the beginning of November. Roughly half of those downloads occurred this month.While Sandbox Coloring may have started the trend, the app called Unicorn is in the lead for the month of December, narrowly beating Sandbox for the most downloads.Also notable is that apps generate revenue through subscriptions, not one-time purchases as other ¡°kid¡± apps have done in the past, when offering access to premium content for paying users. Instead, these apps offer options like weekly, monthly, and annual subscriptions. These promise features like the regular release of new images, ad removal, or the ability to unlock unlimited pictures, among other things.We reached out to the app makers to confirm Sensor Tower numbers, but none responded. One of the published support emails didn¡¯t even work.Yep, that¡¯s right ? you¡¯re not dealing with game makers like EA or Supercell here; but rather indie developers for the most part.The original trendsetter, Sandbox Coloring, comes from Russian developer Alexey Grigorkin, for example. His app¡¯s support site is the barest of web pages.Sensor Tower estimates that Grigorkin has made over $500,000 this month alone from Sandbox¡¯s in-app purchases.Unicorn, from U.K. developer?AppsYouLove, is in the lead by downloads at present, but not ranking. It made more than Sandbox in December ? as much as $630,000, estimates Sensor Tower.It doesn¡¯t appear these developers are bothering with traditional social media marketing, thanks to their ability to ride the trend to get surfaced in App Store search, and from kids telling other kids. AppsYouLove¡¯s Facebook Page, for example, has 3 Likes. That¡¯s not a typo. Just 3. I guess the kids aren¡¯t on Facebook.Belarus-based Easybrain, which makes Pixel Art ? Color by Number, hasn¡¯t even bothered adding the app to its website or giving it a Facebook Page for it, the way it did with its prior success, Sudoku.Only Color by Number seems to come from a larger company: TFG.co, a game developer in Latin America, with over 100 employees. (It¡¯s also the maker of the popular coloring book for adults, Colorfy.) But Color by Number hasn¡¯t made it to TFG.co¡¯s site yet, either. It just has its own basic landing page.Of course, App Store trends like these don¡¯t always last. And in fact, the top four slipped a bit as of today, with only Sandbox retaining its top 10 ranking. Color by Number dropped to #12 and Unicorn is #17. Pixel Art, which was the #27 Top App yesterday, has moved over to the Top Games chart today, where it¡¯s #8.But these apps may again see a spike in a few days¡¯ time ? if kids unwrap new tablets and iPods at Christmas, that is.??"
83,Apps,"¡°I have FOMO for the future¡±, says Sam Lessin. That¡¯s why his startup, Fin, is working backwards from a far-off tech utopia. One day, computers with some human help will answer our every beck and call. Today, Lessin is teaming them up. Every day, Fin gets smarter.For $1 a minute, 24/7, Fin gets your digital chores done. Message, email or speak a request and a real person will snap into action, augmented by a machine intelligence toolkit built from all the tasks Fin¡¯s tackled to date. Sure, it handles research, scheduling, commerce and customer support calls. But it also learns your habits, negotiates for you, and conquers complex jobs like creating a website.Now after two years and funding from top investors, including Kleiner Perkins, Fin is opening up to more customers and press. ¡°We¡¯ve really intentionally talked to no one,¡± says Lessin, a former Facebook VP who sold it his file sharing startup Drop.io.That¡¯s a vastly different approach than most boisterous AI startups have taken. ¡°There¡¯s been this crazy hype cycle,¡± Lessin tells me. ¡°¡®Everything¡¯s a bot. Bots are awesome. Everything¡¯s an assistant.¡¯ All these things fucking suck.¡±Fin was determined not to suck, even if that meant staying quiet. Lessin and co-founder Andrew Kortina have tinkered and tested Fin since mid-2015. ¡°I had done Venmo,¡± Kortina says, downplaying his co-founder role and its sale to PayPal, ¡°and was then doing nothing. I heard Sam was also doing nothing and that piqued my interest, as he¡¯s an old friend.¡±Brainstorming led them to the thesis that ¡°the internet is broken as an information machine,¡± Kortina tells me. They saw a greater destiny than entertainment, distraction and big enterprise. So in Fin¡¯s first incarnation, the duo swapped neglected memos and to-do lists, and tried to find what they could get done for each other. Plenty had been falling through the cracks.¡°I¡¯m okay about doing menial things for colleagues but I¡¯ll just let all that stuff in my own life slip,¡± Kortina admits. ¡°I wouldn¡¯t go to the dentist for years. I didn¡¯t have health insurance after college for 10 years. My credit score was terrible because I had some bill I wouldn¡¯t figure out how to pay.¡±Most people have similarly boring tasks they loathe spending time dealing with. You could call the cable company to fight a price hike or research restaurants and hunt for a reservation. So could Fin. And thanks to Uber we¡¯ve grown accustomed to being able to trade money for that time back, sidestepping slow public transportation or looking for parking when we¡¯re in a rush.Fin co-founders Sam Lessin (left) and Andrew Kortina (right) in front of the flag of FinlandWhile it¡¯s easy to imagine Fin as merely a first-world luxury for the lazy, and it¡¯s great at that, it¡¯s also a productivity tool that can let people achieve more of what only they can do. Kortina talks about Fin as a way to ¡°instantly offload¡± chores.Even if you could power through a task faster than Fin could second-hand and keep the dollars, ¡°It¡¯s not just the cost of doing that thing yourself. It¡¯s the context switching,¡± Kortina explains. ¡°It¡¯s so hard for me to get into a really good state of concentration and flow and creativity, and when I get into that state I don¡¯t want to be interrupted.¡±Fin¡¯s far from the only personal assistant startup trying to save you time, but many of the others fail due to hubris, relying too heavily on their own code as the answer to every question. ¡°The mistake is looking at machine learning and thinking we¡¯re so close to this general intelligence,¡± Lessin insists. Replacing humans outright isn¡¯t the answer. ¡°The future is people helping people.¡±Competitors that can go AI-only are restricted to narrow sets of tasks, like x.ai for meeting scheduling. Traditional and virtual assistant services can be inefficient. Facebook¡¯s M assistant?also uses a combo of humans and AI but is free and hasn¡¯t been opened up to the public.One service similar to Fin called GoButler was forced to pivot to solely automated assistance, and eventually sold as scrap to Amazon. Fin¡¯s most remaining direct competitor is Magic. It¡¯s cheaper at $0.59 per minute but only takes requests via text message. Lessin moonlights as a partner for Slow Ventures, which participated in Magic¡¯s $12 million 2015 Series A, which raises some concerns about conflicts of interest he wouldn¡¯t comment on. [Update: More examples of competitors were added to this paragraph.]But wait, isn¡¯t AI supposed to take everyone¡¯s jobs? Lessin envisions a new industrial revolution instead. He cites cobblers making a few shoes while waiting around the shop for customers, struggling to match fluctuating demand. But with steam and electricity ¡°you had a new source of power. It¡¯s not like power stopped work. You had humans doing what they were good at, tech doing what tech was good at, and you had way more shoes.¡±With Fin, though, Lessin¡¯s vision involves a team of round-the-clock operators equipped with AI and processes for similar tasks can snap into action even after-hours, rather than a full-time dedicated assistant being ¡°paid for showing up being on YouTube¡± and then going off the job, Lessin says. Even if it¡¯s expensive at $1 per effective minute of work, Fin is exceedingly convenient, and you don¡¯t pay for down time.To use Fin, you just pop open its minimalist black-and-white desktop site or iOS app, then type, speak or upload a photo of your request. If you¡¯re unsure what you could ask for, there¡¯s an anonymized feed of real examples from other users to spark your imagination.¡°We can execute any task that doesn¡¯t require hands in your city,¡± says Lessin, noting how hard it is for some startups to?get local scale and capacity nailed down. ¡°I have incredible respect for Instacart.¡± He also points out that ¡°there are types of specialized knowledge we can¡¯t currently do for you. Ask us some PhD physics problem and it will either take a long time or we won¡¯t do it.¡±Usually, though, you get messaged back almost immediately by a Fin human who collects any necessary details and gets started. I felt an instantaneous sense of relief upon outsourcing my responsibilities. Along the way, your task gets updated with progress and requests for secondary decisions. When possible, it just pulls things like addresses and airplane seat preferences from your onboarding survey, and payment information or online passwords from the app¡¯s Vault. You get a detailed statement of exactly how Fin used your time and how much you owe.¡°Our job is to mix the best tool or person for the job in a way to deliver an experience that¡¯s better than you can get from working with a single isolated individual, or a piece of pure software,¡± Kortina declares.That¡¯s where the name ¡°Fin¡± comes in. ¡°Like ¡®the end¡¯ in French films,¡± Lessin reveals. ¡°This is the interface and the ways things will work in 50 or 100 years.¡± While technology will get more and more adept at a wider range of tasks, he imagines that in the end, it will still be humans sending requests to computer-human teams.The hardest part of using Fin is getting over the mental hurdle of relinquishing control while paying for what you could do yourself.¡°I?think that¡¯s the real competitor,¡± says Lessin. Even factoring in what your time¡¯s worth and the context switching overhead, Fin can produce some serious sticker shock. That¡¯s accentuated by our idealized predictions that underestimate the time required to do things. ¡°How long does it take to book movie tickets?¡± Lessin jokes. ¡°30 seconds??No!¡±Fin¡¯s teamI was charged $80 to deal with having a mis-shipped iPhone X refunded and a new one bought and sent. While I was thankful not to have to deal with customer support, it was some pricey peace of mind. Getting a holiday restaurant reservation originally cost me $150, which is completely absurd even if it took several loops to find the right time and get me to sign a credit card payment form for the prix fixe dinner.Luckily, I was refunded that $150 after submitting a complaint through the app, which is easy to do through Fin¡¯s thumbs up/down buttons on each request. ¡°Most really heavy users escalate / ask about something every month or two,¡± Lessin admits. Fin uses internal benchmarking tools to track if certain assistants take too long on a task or routinely do too much research in a category. Still, Fin sometimes goes overboard so users shouldn¡¯t be shy about contesting any charges that seem ridiculous. You can sign-up through this link for TechCrunch readers to get a discount on your first tasks.Fin initially launched in beta with a $120 per month subscription fee. But Kortina gripes that ¡°all we were learning is how people could arbitrage Fin to do way more than $120 worth of service.¡± He seems to be having bad acid flashbacks to before Venmo started charging a 3 percent credit card fee in 2012, when people would just send money back and forth to hit minimum spending limit or earn points while Venmo ate the fees.With the switch to per-minute pricing, ¡°We¡¯ve set ourselves up for the long haul by really focusing on unit economics,¡± says Lessin, in contrast to many on-demand startups. That surely delights Fin¡¯s investors?John Doerr at KPCB, Sameer Gandhi at Accel, and Saar Gur at CRV. While Lessin won¡¯t reveal exactly how much Fin has raised, he calls them ¡°good capital partners,¡± noting the startup has enough cash to ¡°be able to do this for a long time.¡± Fin now has 20 employees on the technical side, while it¡¯s climbing toward 100 when you include its full-time operators.Not subsidizing the service is a healthy choice for Fin, but that means ¡°Unfortunately it¡¯s not at a price point that everyone on Earth can afford.¡± Whether through economies of scale, AI advancement, or human training, Fin may need to bring the price down if it wants widespread adoption. ¡°The future?is already here¡± sci-fi author William Gibson once said, ¡°it¡¯s just not very?evenly distributed.¡±The premium price tag begets premium service that makes Siri and her cohorts feel like mere calculators in comparison. ¡°The message is you should demand a lot more out of assistant services than cooking timers and Google search lookups,¡± Lessin concludes. In an era when technology is designed to soak up the maximum amount of your time, Fin lets you buy it back. We¡¯ll each have to decide how much it¡¯s worth."
84,Apps,"Instagram has been steadily beefing up its Direct Messaging feature in recent months, as it has begun to toy with the idea of spinning out messaging into its own, separate app. Among its more recent tweaks was last month¡¯s added option for photo and video message replays, and earlier enhancements like support for web links and different photo orientations. Today, it¡¯s rolling out another change ? users can now privately send live videos over Direct Messaging.This includes your own live video, the company says, or you can share a live video you¡¯re currently watching with a friend or group of friends.While the former option is largely a tweak on video chatting ? a way to broadcast privately to friends ? the latter seems to be more a challenger to a rising crop of ¡°co-watching¡± and video chat apps.For example, Google has Uptime, an experimental app for co-watching YouTube videos, launched out of its in-house incubator, Area 120. The idea here is that a group of friends can virtually ¡°hang out¡± on their phones, while streaming, chatting and reacting to videos with emojis.Others operating in this space include Tumblr¡¯s?Cabana,?Let¡¯s Watch It and iMessage app?Fam, to name a few.?Skype even said it was working on a feature like this.The key idea here is that kids today don¡¯t always spend time together in person, but they still ¡°hang out¡± through their phones. Thanks to more powerful hardware and camera systems, they¡¯re able to now do so through video.In Instagram¡¯s case, it¡¯s not just about co-watching, but about doing so with live video. And this twist on the concept becomes merely a feature of its app ? or perhaps even a feature in a standalone messenger app in the future ? instead of the entirety of the user experience.When you¡¯re live on Instagram, you can take advantage of the new option by tapping the Direct icon at the bottom of the screen. The company notes that your self-recorded live videos can only be viewed by friends when you¡¯re currently live. While live, viewers can comment and react, but if they arrive too late, they¡¯ll only see a message that the video is over.For live videos you want to co-watch with friends, the process is the same ? you tap the Direct icon to share the video through messaging.If you don¡¯t want to participate, you can choose to disable live video sharing in Direct via your Stories settings, Instagram says. And if you have a Private account, you can only share live videos with your followers.The live video sharing feature is rolling out now to Instagram on iOS and Android through a software update ? you¡¯ll need to download the latest version (ver. 26) of the app to use the feature."
85,Apps,"FabFitFun, the women¡¯s lifestyle subscription service and media company that¡¯s become a household name among influencers of a certain generation, is expanding its empire with the launch of a new video app for Apple TV and Amazon Fire.The Los Angeles company founded by Daniel and Michael Broukhim has become one of the darlings of the tech scene in Southern California by virtue of its success in the subscription box business and its reach with the instafamous?(cf. the company was recently name-dropped in a New Yorker article;?a couple caught canoodling at its latest event made headlines in Page Six; and it created a bespoke box for MTV¡¯s Video Music Awards).A common (somewhat envious) refrain among startup founders in LA is: ¡°The Broukhims are printing money.¡±While the brothers Broukhim are mum about the revenue from their retail business, the reach is undeniable, and video is a key component for growth, according to co-founder and co-chief executive Daniel Broukhim.It¡¯s also a return to the company¡¯s media roots as an online magazine in 2010.?¡°Brands would send us products for editorial review and provide us with VIP gift bags at media events,¡± Daniel told us back when the company raised its first (and only) outside cash in 2015. ¡°Nobody was replicating that experience ? of getting to try all these amazing products ? for public consumption. We thought we could deliver that experience for our audience.¡±Now the Broukhims (and co-founder Katie Rosen Kitchens ? the company¡¯s editor-in-chief) are following the rest of the media industry with a ¡°pivot to video.¡± But unlike other properties, they¡¯re bolstered by a subscription retail business that¡¯s generating significant revenues (I¡¯ve heard well north of $100 million) and a website that reaches more than 3 million visitors per month.¡°We are able to marry content, commerce and community in ways that [subscribers] can¡¯t get anywhere else,¡± Broukhim told me.The evolution of FabFitFun in some ways mirrors the symbiotic evolution of content and commerce online. Influencers, who are integral to how the company markets itself and creates its content, are also now their own brands, much as FabFitFun went from a media property to a retail channel ? and also a brand of its own with its own lines of makeup (ISH ? in partnership with Joey Maalouf) and clothing and accessories (Summer & Rose).The TV app is yet another way to leverage the work the company does across multiple channels with influencers. The boxes inform the videos, which have lived on the company¡¯s website since March. It also complements the company¡¯s iPhone app, which launched earlier this year with an augmented reality experience built around FabFitFun¡¯s subscription boxes.The new app will put the company¡¯s videos on Apple TV and Amazon Fire, significantly expanding the footprint beyond its current 400,000 video viewership.Most of the content on the app is exclusive to members, but during January a selection of cooking and fitness tips and tricks will be available for free.Chefs Silvia Baldini, winner of Food Network¡¯s ¡°Chopped¡± series, and Pamela Salzman, an LA-based cookbook writer, will offer lessons from the kitchen while new fitness videos will be made available daily on the app and through Facebook Live workouts with popular influencers.For instance, Rachel Brathen will be offering yoga classes; oneOeight Fitness Prevail Boxing?will be offering boxing lessons; Exhale Spa, is pitching fusion classes of pilates, ballet and yoga; and The Barre Code is offering¡¦ well¡¦ barre.The company also is incorporating its own products into the video content with Burn 60, which uses the FabFitFunTV fitness ball (coming in the company¡¯s next subscription box).To help helm this new content voyage, FabFitFun has enlisted Carter Baldwin as the company¡¯s new vice president of content. On the job since August, Baldwin was the former head of his own video shop that worked with brands like JustFab before going in-house at Ipsy to help Michelle Phan grow her beauty empire.At FabFitFun, Baldwin will help manage the company¡¯s content creation from the new video production studio space it just set up in its offices.¡°Content is part of FabFitFun¡¯s DNA,¡± said Baldwin in statement. ¡°We¡¯re excited to build on the momentum of our FabFitFunTV launch earlier this year with the opening of FabFitFun Studios at our newly-expanded headquarters. We expect the space to be a hub for collaboration with our influencer and brand partners to create original content exclusively for our community.¡±New studio space and an app for over the top video distribution are just laying the groundwork for what looks to be a busy year for FabFitFun. According to Daniel Broukhim, there are plans in place for a men¡¯s membership box ¡°down the road¡± and the company will continue to roll out more brands with its growing stable of influencers.¡°We think the opportunity is to keep launching brands like ISH with influencers as part of our platform,¡± Broukhim said. ¡°The reason we launched the contour kit is because Joey wanted to do it and our customers wanted it.¡±"

He tells TechCrunch he wants to build his own thing again, but the fact that the No. 1 teen social network isn¡¯t exciting enough to stay at is telling.Share prices are down, user growth has slowed to a crawl in the face of Instagram¡¯s competition and it¡¯s missing revenue targets. Reports increasingly indicate Snap is a tough place to work, ruled by CEO Evan Spiegel with an iron fist, and run by his inner circle even when they lack experience. SVP of Engineering Tim Sehn, early employee Chloe Drimal, VP of HR and Legal Robyn Thomas and VP of Securities and Facilities Martin Lev have all parted ways with Snap since July.Timehop (left) versus Facebook¡¯s clone On This Day (right)Wegener¡¯s Mom made him a Snapchat cake in 2016, foreshadowing his role thereA tipster pointed to Wegener¡¯s Twitter bio noting he¡¯d left Snapchat. We asked Wegener why he¡¯s leaving and he told TechCrunch ¡°I had a great year at Snap ? love the product, team, and learned a ton. But ultimately I¡¯m most passionate about building companies and products from scratch, and I decided to take some time off to travel and be inspired before I get back into the swing of things in 2018. Keep an eye out next year.¡±Timehop had raised $14 million from investors for its app that showed your social media posts from that day in years past. It had 6 million daily users by 2014. But Facebook cloned it with its ¡°On This Day¡± feature in 2015, which had grown to 60 million daily visitors by 2016. A Timehop redesign bombed and Wegener left in January 2017 to go to Snapchat.There he must have found a similarly grim situation. Also cloned by Facebook and its subsidiary Instagram, Snapchat had lost momentum. The Snapchat Memories feature most similar to Timehop saw little evolution this year. Stock he was promised surely has a much lower value now than Wegener might have suspected before the hyped March IPO. And fighting a?colossus in a crowded space sounds a lot less fun than starting something fresh."
87,Apps,"In case you wanted something engrossing to keep you distracted from family squabbles this holiday, a special gift just arrived: Civilization VI, which is now available as a $30 purchase for iPad via the App Store.The world building simulation game is possibly the most ambitious and expansive ever to hit the iPad, and it has hefty spec requirements to match ??you¡¯ll need at least iOS 11, and also an iPad Air 2, one of the standard iPads released in 2017, or any model of iPad Pro to run it. It also includes a free trial mode that lets you demo the free game for 60 turns without paying a cent (spoiler: you¡¯ll want more turns).Civilization is one of the longest-standing video game franchises, and has seen tremendous success on PC over the years. Civilization: Revolution, a less complex spinout, has previously made its way to the iPad, but this is the full Civilization VI released for PCs originally last year.If you liked Revolution on iPad, or you¡¯re new to the series, definitely give this a try ??at least for the free 60 turns. If you¡¯re a fan of the franchise with compatible hardware, I know you¡¯ve already purchased this so I won¡¯t waste my breath. Note that the price does go up to its regular $60 after January 4, so there¡¯s very little reason to wait on this gem."
88,Apps,"Launched just 9 months ago?on iOS and last month on Android, LIKEtoKNOW.it has just hit 1M registered users on their mobile app, bringing total users to 2.8M.As a refresher, LIKEtoKNOW.it is a service that lets you ¡°like¡± pictures from Instagram influencers and automatically get links to buy their outfits sent to your inbox. And their recently launched mobile app lets you take screenshots of an influencer¡¯s picture (no matter what platform you find it on) and will then tell you what the items are in the picture along with links to buy it.Both products are made by rewardStyle, a Dallas-based content monetization platform for social media influencers. This year the company hit $1B in single year sales, with about 30% coming from LIKEtoKNOW.it shoppers. This means that social media has driven nearly $300M in sales for rewardStyle this year, up 10x from just $10M three years ago.When the app first launched we talked about it potentially being a good way for rewardStyle to build their own discovery channel, so they wouldn¡¯t have to be as reliant on social networks for traffic.Almost a year later it seems that this strategy worked out, as two-thirds of all purchases made in the app are driven from content discovered inside the app, versus being found on outside websites or social platform. And social features like being able to follow and search for influencers have made it even easier for the app to become a totally standalone social shopping experience.The company works with about 4,300 brands ranging from Gucci to Walmart, all of whom pay a commission via rewardStyle to influencers who decide to wear and tag upwards of 50,000 products in their social media posts each day. Marketplaces want to get in on the action too ? eBay just inked a partnership with rewardStyle that will let influencers select products from eBay¡¯s inventory.Of course rewardStyle isn¡¯t the only one trying to drive mobile commerce via social media. Instagram is working on their own shopping platform, which essentially lets brands create their own stores on Instagram. But it¡¯s important to note that this is a different approach than rewardStyle, which keeps the focus on influencers and doesn¡¯t allow brands to directly publish content. This means the two offerings can not only coexist, but probably help each other in the long run if they both end up getting more users to embrace the world of mobile shopping.While rewardStyle is mum about what major new features are in the pipeline, expect to see an acceleration of the shift to mobile sales. In 2017 a total of 24% of rewardStyle¡¯s sales will come from their mobile platform LIKEtoKNOW.it, up from 15% last year."
89,Apps,"Can a deep dreaming AI transform low res photos into crisply detailed high res images?Let¡¯s Enhance is an Estonia-based startup that¡¯s using a so-called ¡®hallucinating AI¡¯?deep neural network to power a freemium photo upscaling service. On its website it claims the learning software ¡°hallucinates missing details to make image look natural¡±.It launched the online tool at the end of October, garnering a bit of early press coverage.??I tried it out at the time but results seemed mixed and it was hard to judge how useful it might be without a proper use case to test it on.So I bided my time and this month happened to find myself with just the sort of digital photo challenge that I thought the service might be able to help with ? in that photos I wanted to gift as framed prints didn¡¯t have a great resolution for producing a decent sized print.?Low res photo problems? AI to the rescue!One of the photos was just a fun smartphone snap. But others were a bit more high stakes ? being from a wedding.And after attempting (unsuccessfully) to source their full res versions ? attendees¡¯ photos having been collectively shared after the fact via iCloud; and no one could apparently remember who had taken the specific shots I was after (or on what device) ? I decided to run them and the more casual portrait through Let¡¯s Enhance to see if I could boost the resolution and have a chance at turning them into gift-able prints.The service is freemium and caps the number of photos you can run through it per day. It also locks out at 10 free photos total before you¡¯re pushed towards one of its subscription plans. But as I only had a few shots to upscale I was able to run everything through the freemium gate without needing to sign up for a subscription or buy a cost bundle (which they also offer).Each photo you upload to Let¡¯s Enhance¡¯s AI gets returned to you after seconds (or maybe up to a minute or two) of processing time in three versions, reflecting the different stages applied to try to AI-enhance it. So per photo you get three files back, which are given the following labels: Anti-jpeg, boring and magic.The ¡®anti-jpeg¡¯ version of the image does not upscale the actual size ? it just appears to lightly polish out some compression artifacts. Though I found its results to be pretty subtle, at least on the shots I tried and comparing original vs anti-jpeg images on a screen.The ¡®boring¡¯ and ¡®magic¡¯ techniques always upscale the image by 4x so I?was able to turn ? for example ? a 520KB digital photo file with a resolution of 898¡¿1600 into 21.8MB with a full 3492¡¿6400 pixels. So ? in theory at least ? the upscaled version could be printed poster sized.The results from the boring and magic techniques applied to this particular portrait photo seemed visually impressive on screen. Though the portrait was taken at a fair distance and its cluttered graffiti stairwell background is probably a pretty forgiving canvas for concealing upscaling imperfections.To my eye there wasn¡¯t a huge difference between the two processing techniques when applied to this photo ? the magic version produced a very slightly fuzzier result. But again, for this particular shot either file would probably have yielded a fine framable print.The photos from the wedding were definitely a lot more challenging.?Two of the original shots appear to have been taken with a smartphone camera of fairly standard quality, so while they look nice on a screen their low resolution of just 1024?¡¿?577 meant the max size you could reasonably expect to print them would be a tiddly ~4-inches.After cropping one of these shots to remove an incidental bystander and upscaling via Let¡¯s Enhance the image came back with a resolution of 3408¡¿2304. So at least technically large enough to produce a decent sized print.An added challenge with the second image was that it had been taken at a distance, in portrait orientation, and I wanted a close up of the faces ? which meant major cropping into a smaller landscape format and an attempt to focus on what had been pretty remote details to start with.After upscaling and cropping I got an image with a resolution of 2182¡¿1684. Again, in theory, a small print could work at that resolution.However the AI upscaling had produced an effect that was definitely a lot more vaseline screen than fine outlining ? doubtless on account of the original shot not being great quality to begin with.Let¡¯s Enhance CEO Oleksandr Savsunenko did warn me that: ¡°If the picture is too much zoomed or pixelized, the system will ¡®consider¡¯ it as natural pattern and will not change it.¡±So I wasn¡¯t exactly expecting miracles. But even the slightly larger of the two photos did not look exactly crisp in terms of detailing after its AI trip.Of the two processing layers, boring again appeared to have worked best ? with magic resulting in a lot more fuzz/artifacts in both of the shots. Including giving the edge of what should be some skin a kind of fabric-style fringing.That must be the AI pattern-spotter at work¡¦A third image from the wedding was a full res photo, so didn¡¯t have the same quality problems. But again I was after just a cropped detail ? so I used Let¡¯s Enhance to upscale the crop to enhance its resolution. This mean I went from a reasonable 2032¡¿2355 to a generous 8128¡¿9416.As well as being a better quality image to start with this wasn¡¯t such a close up portrait so the upscaling seemed to work better here, especially across a cityscape/landscape background with the couple only being shown in profile. Although, here too, details on the magic version came out slightly fuzzier than the others.Now, armed with my upscaled files ? and at least a chance of some passable prints, I loaded the images onto a thumb drive and headed down to the photo shop.?So how did the prints look?As expected, the upscaled crop from the high res original wedding photo came out well ? in all versions I printed.A 20 x 15cm print looked great and had clear and vivid details. A non-professional wouldn¡¯t guess it was just a section from a larger shot. Although whether this was down to the AI¡¯s skilled upscaling or really more a case of having a reasonable resolution to begin with for a print that size is less clear.When it came to two lower quality original AI-upscaled wedding photos, the quality of the ~6 x 4-inch prints I got back wasn¡¯t great ? reflecting the enduring fuzziness of the digital versions. Some of the darker skintones had also been given a weirdly grey-ish hue.The less challenging of the two shots would be just about passable in a photo album. But neither print was gift quality. The portrait with slightly clearer detail to begin with printed up looking almost irritatingly just out of focus. At least to a human eye.Clearly a hallucinating AI is no substitute for having a full res original.That said, if you only have an average quality mobile snap to start with then you have to work with what you¡¯ve got. And I¡¯d probably been able to produce the best quality prints I could hope for, given the low quality source material.The casual smartphone snap fared a lot better. A print of around 8 x 6-inches looked great framed up ? and had especially impressive background detail.The maximum size the print shop suggested for poster printing the image based on its file size was a full meter high(!). Which would clearly have been pushing it. I opted for a poster print half that size ? and the resulting print definitely did not have as impressively crisp details as the photo print.You could now pretty clearly see visible artifacting in the background graphics and graffiti ? so I was definitely getting to the limits of what you can do with an AI-upscaled image at this point¡¦Even so, given the grungy subject matter, the poster still came out looking pretty cool overall. So for this use-case I was pleased.?A hallucinating deep neural network Here¡¯s how Savsunenko explains the technology underpinning the Let¡¯s Enhance service: ¡°The core of our Hallucinating AI is a deep neural network with custom architecture loosely based on modern GAN approach (GAN ? Generative Adversarial Network). It was discovered a few years ago and has a wide variety of application besides generating acid trips.¡°The basic idea of GAN is to train two networks at once ? one network does the upscaling, another acts as a critic ? learning how to distinguish real images from upscaled ones. During training upscaling network tries to produce the image to fool the critic and improves based on its feedback. This teaches upscaling network to produce realistically looking images. We also use several pre- and post-processing filters based on image type and quality.¡±According to Savsunenko, the?tool works best with upscaling digital photos and digitally created illustrations.¡°We¡¯ve been contacted by a number of users sharing their result and we were surprised to found a very broad use-cases,¡± he said ? claiming for example that scientists and doctors are using the tool to upscale X-ray and microscopy photographs to ¡°better see the details¡±.He added that others have used the service to ¡®save¡¯?their digital photo collection when they lost their hi res originals.Another use-case he mentioned is for ecommerce owners to boost product images quality ? especially when they¡¯re resellers and thus can¡¯t take better photos of the products themselves.He also said it¡¯s useful for photographers wanting to crop out parts of images and still be able to print them out ? a use case I also tested. Though I found this really only worked if you had a good quality image to start with.Bottom line: If your original is a bit fuzzy the AI isn¡¯t going to work miracles and clean it up.He also clarified that the anti-jpeg neural network is intended specifically for removing JPEG artifacts.?¡°Even iPhone does JPEG compression ? if you what to enlarge part of your iPhone photo this combo works best,¡± he noted on that.?Let¡¯s Enhance: Verdict¡¦Overall ? off screen ? I was not overly wowed by the results.Let¡¯s Enhance may be a useful tool when you have smartphone snaps you want to size up for using digitally. But it¡¯s not literally going to enhance?the details of the original shots if they¡¯re a bit fuzzy or out of focus to begin with (with perhaps the exception of Jpeg artifacts, though I can¡¯t say my tests proved this out either).¡®Let¡¯s Embiggen¡¯ might be a more accurate name for the service.That said, photos with more forgiving compositions can upscale more successfully ? and made for some reasonable prints in my experience. Landscapes vs portrait shots are probably a safer bet. As for weddings and other key occasions, AI is definitely not going to be putting any professional photographers out of business yet.I¡¯m not sure Let¡¯s Enhance would be a service I¡¯d deem useful enough to subscribe to for just upscaling the odd snap or two. But they do also offer bundles like 20 images for $4.99.The service seems most useful if you need a tool for supersizing low res digital imagery regularly, say for fairly lightweight ecommerce purposes. (And indeed, that¡¯s where?Oleksandr says the original idea came from ? after?his father asked for help with design and visual content for his Internet shop and only had low res images on tap.)Otherwise I¡¯d say you¡¯re better off investing in a decent camera ? and/or a pro photographer. Turns out, even a deep dreaming AI can¡¯t fix a fuzzy shot it in the edit."
90,Apps,"Parenting Hero is an app created on the premise no matter how many parenting books you read, a lot of that knowledge vacates your brain when faced with an indignant child on the verge of a meltdown. The app, currently available on iOS, takes tenets from the book ¡°How to Talk So Little Kids Will Listen: A Survival Guide to Life with Children Ages 2-7¡± and presents them in role-playing scenarios that guide users through different responses to common parenting dilemmas.Developed by Warsaw-based education app startup Mythic Owl, Parenting Hero is illustrated with 1,500 panels hand-drawn by graphic designer Katarzyna Struczy?ska. Mythic Owl was founded in 2014 by chief executive officer Tomasz Mularczyk to create games that give educators more teaching tools.The former chief technology officer of Medicalgorithmics, which makes cardiac monitoring devices, Mularczyk told TechCrunch that he went to a lot of parenting workshops to learn the best ways to communicate with his three children, but felt there should be a better way to practice techniques than for the first time with a kid.Mularczyk¡¯s mother and father owned copies of classic parenting books by Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish, the authors of ¡°How To Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk.¡± As a teenager, Mularczyk liked to browse through their comic-like illustrations. When he had kids of his own, Mularczyk returned to the books for advice and discovered an app opportunity.¡°I thought that since parents have so little time nowadays, it would be great to allow them to improve their skills using this medium and giving them the interactivity through choice for every scene,¡± he said in an email.He contacted Adele Faber and Joanna, her daughter, and found out that Joanna was getting ready to publish ¡°How to Talk to Little Kids Will Listen¡± with co-author Julie King, which is based on the same ideas as ¡°How to Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk,¡± such as speaking honestly about emotions in order to resolve conflicts without fighting.Mythic Owl worked with Joanna Faber and King for ten months to make sure Parenting Hero stayed true to their book.¡°We presented our prototype to Joanna Faber and Julie King and even though they had thought that it¡¯s almost impossible to capture ideas like this with an app, they believe our approach had achieved it,¡± said Mularczyk.The app costs $4.99, so parents might wonder why they should spend money on it instead of, or in addition to, the $12.99 e-book version of ¡°How to Talk So Little Kids Will Listen.¡± Mularczyk believes the app has two key benefits: parents can familiarize themselves with Faber and King¡¯s advice quickly and it also serves as a quick reminder about how to follow the book¡¯s principles when faced with a conflict. After completing a category, users can print out a card with tips and advice they learned in each scenario.Mularczyk says versions of Parenting Hero for other platforms will come out next month. Future updates to the app will include new scenarios based on feedback from parents and optimizations to allow it to run more efficiently on older smartphones."
91,Apps,"Apple today announced it¡¯s amending the App Store guideline that banned apps created using templates and other app generation services. When the company revised its policies earlier this year, the move was meant to reduce the number of low-quality apps and spam.?But the decision ended up?impacting a much wider market ? including small businesses, restaurants, nonprofits, organizations, clubs and others who don¡¯t have the in-house expertise or funds to build custom apps from scratch.Apple¡¯s new rule is meant to offer better clarity on what sort of apps will and will not be accepted in the App Store.Before, the 4.2.6 App Store guideline read as follows:4.2.6 Apps created from a commercialized template or app generation service will be rejected.The company¡¯s revised wording now states:4.2.6 Apps created from a commercialized template or app generation service will be rejected unless they are submitted directly by the provider of the app¡¯s content. These services should not submit apps on behalf of their clients and should offer tools that let their clients create customized, innovative apps that provide unique customer experiences.This is Apple¡¯s attempt to clarify how it thinks about templated apps.Core to this is the idea that, while it¡¯s fine for small businesses and organizations to go through a middleman like the app templating services, the app template providers shouldn¡¯t be the ones ultimately publishing these apps on their clients¡¯ behalf.Instead, Apple wants every app on the App Store to be published by the business or organization behind the app. (This is something that¡¯s been suggested before). That means your local pizza shop, your church, your gym, etc. needs to have reviewed the App Store documentation and licensing agreement themselves, and more actively participate in the app publishing process.Apple in early 2018 will waive the $99 developer fee for all government and nonprofits starting in the U.S. to make this transition easier.It¡¯s still fine if a middleman ? like a template building service ? aids them in this. And it¡¯s also fine if a template-building service helps them create the app in the first place. In fact, Apple isn¡¯t really concerned so much about ¡°how¡± the app gets built (so long as it¡¯s not a wrapped webpage) ? it cares about the end result.Apps need to offer high-quality experience, the company insists. They shouldn¡¯t all look identical; they shouldn¡¯t look like clones of one another. And, most importantly, they shouldn¡¯t look like the web or serve as just a wrapper around what could otherwise just be the business website or their Facebook Page.Apps are meant to be more than the web, offering a deeper, richer experience, Apple believes.Above: The original version of the Official Lumineers app, built by AppMakrThere is some disagreement on how extensively this rule is being enforced, however.Today, consumers may interact with one of these ¡°templated clones¡± ? like an app for their favorite taco place, their church, a local band, their school, etc. They don¡¯t know that the app is one of many that look just like it, and they probably don¡¯t care.In addition, a sort of uniformity to apps in a given space could make them easier to use, some argue. You¡¯ll know where to find the ¡°mobile ordering¡± feature, or where the menu is located when they¡¯re not all unique snowflakes, trying to be different for difference¡¯s sake.On the flip side, Apple sees an ecosystem filled with thousands of copycats and clones as a very bad thing. It¡¯s unfair to developers who have custom-built their apps, and it can even crash the App Store when one tries to load some 20,000 apps published under a single developer account.While most generally agree that low-quality apps don¡¯t deserve to be on the App Store, there¡¯s industry concern that banning template-based apps as a whole has been an overreach.The move even caught the attention of?Congressman Ted W. Lieu (33rd District, California), who told Apple it was ¡°casting too wide a net¡± in its effort to remove spam and illegitimate apps from the App Store, and was ¡°invalidating apps from longstanding and legitimate developers who pose no threat to the App Store¡¯s integrity.¡±It seemed odd, too, that a company that on the one hand had?argued that everyone deserved free and equal access to the internet?created a rule that makes it more difficult for smaller companies and nonprofits from doing business on the App Store ? especially at a time when accessing the web is more often done through the gateway of mobile apps. (See above chart ? the browser is pass?).At the very least, this amended language seems to offer some respite for the templating service providers. They can still act as a middleman for the smaller companies, so long as they build customized apps that don¡¯t look like one another, and the clients publish them under their own accounts. They can even use components to build those apps, as long as the apps have variety to their interfaces and offer an app-like, not web-like, experience.The rule arguably is meant to offer consumers a better App Store filled with well-built, quality apps, but it will have a sweeping effect on small businesses and their ability to compete with larger entities. Sure, the pizza place could sell through Uber Eats ? but at a steep cost. Sure, the nail salon could advertise on Yelp or the mom-and-pop could have a Facebook Page ? and many do, of course. Such is the nature of the world. But that also puts the business at the mercy of the larger aggregators, while an app ? much like a website ? puts the business in more control over their own destiny.Recently, TechCrunch reported that?many companies operating in this space were given a January 1, 2018 deadline for compliance with the revised guidelines. After this date, the App Store Review team told the companies their new apps wouldn¡¯t be allowed in the App Store. Some apps had already fallen under the ban, and were seeing their submissions rejected. (Apps already live were grandfathered in, and could be updated. But it was unclear how long that would be the case.)Some companies had even shut down their business as a result of these changes.The adjusted language doesn¡¯t appear to allow them to continue as they did before. Instead, they will need to develop new tools to provide clients with ¡°customized, innovative apps that provide unique customer experiences.¡±In other words, be more like Squarespace, less like Google Sites ? but for apps.Above: One of these is a template-based app. You can tell, right?The affected companies weren¡¯t all what you considered ¡°spam¡± app makers. While of course some that were wrapping webpages made sense to ban, others operated in more of a gray area.They ranged from those that offered tools for small businesses?that wanted their own app store presence to those that served particular industries ? like ChowNow, which builds apps for restaurants that want their own mobile ordering systems, or those that build apps for churches, fitness studios, spas, politicians, events and more.These businesses told us the 4.2.6 (and sometimes the 4.3) guidelines were being cited by the App Review team when rejecting their apps. They also told us they had trouble getting clarity from Apple when discussing the matter in private, one-on-one phone calls.The former rule (4.2.6) bans the template-based apps, while the latter (4.3) is more of a catch-all for banning spam. The 4.3 rule was used at times when Apple couldn¡¯t prove that the app was built using a wizard or drag-and-drop system, we were told.Above: the wording of the rules before today¡¯s changesWhen Apple first announced the changes at WWDC, many of these template providers and app generation services thought they wouldn¡¯t be impacted ? the ban was meant to weed out the clone-makers and spammers. That¡¯s why it came as a surprise when Apple reviewers began informing them that they, too, would no longer be allowed to publish their apps to the App Store.?They didn¡¯t think of themselves as spammers.Apple¡¯s newly worded policy provides more clarity on the matter, but it doesn¡¯t really change Apple¡¯s prior intention.If the app is basically just a website, if it looks like other apps, then don¡¯t bother; the App Store is not for you."
92,Apps,"Earlier this year, Microsoft shut down Photosynth, its service for stitching multiple images into panoramas and semi-3D models. When it launched in 2008, the service was extremely impressive, but it never quite caught on. Still, it had its fans ? and now Microsoft is bringing it back in the form of a new feature in its Pix camera app for iOS.In addition, the Pix app is also getting a comics feature (the result of an internal hackathon) that uses a machine learning model to find the best frames from your Pix Moment captures to create a basic comic strip. All you need to do is add your speech bubbles.Microsoft notes that the new Photosynth feature uses some of the technology behind the original platform, but it also notes that Photosynth in Pix is now faster and allows for smoother capture. It also makes use of the built-in Pix features like auto-enhancements for white balance, tone and sharpness.¡°The idea came after some frustrations I had when trying to take a picture of Snoqualmie Falls,¡±?said Josh Weisberg, principal program manager within Microsoft¡¯s AI & Research organization in Redmond, Washington, in today¡¯s announcement. ¡°I didn¡¯t want to have to choose which part of the scene to capture, and I wanted it all with detail. Photosynth means you no longer have to choose. I can now capture the whole scene in a way that feels natural. As with all Pix features, we have also worked to give the best image quality by introducing more intelligent ways to compute exposure and stitching.¡±Sadly, if you¡¯re an Android user, Microsoft didn¡¯t have any news to share about when (or if) it plans to bring Pix to your mobile platform of choice."
93,Apps,"While we won¡¯t call this a huge watershed moment per se, something nominally interesting in the world of Weird Social Media Things happened this morning: Snap and Twitter are now worth the same based on their market caps.With some small moves on both companies¡¯ shares, both companies are now hovering around $18.7 billion in market cap. There are some extra mechanics that go into this, but it¡¯s worth noting simply because it¡¯s indicative of both the changing sentiment around Snap and Twitter. On the year, Twitter¡¯s stock price is up around 50%, while Snap¡¯s?stock price is down around 35% after it went public earlier this year.Let¡¯s get to the charts! Here¡¯s Twitter first for the past year:And here¡¯s Snap:So, really, this is the tale of two stocks and two companies. Both have shown pretty tepid growth, but with an upgrade a few days ago that sent Twitter shares soaring, it may be that Twitter has been able to turn the narrative in such a way that investors are looking at the company in a new way. Meanwhile, Snap¡¯s stock is in a tailspin after being one of the big blockbuster IPOs this year that¡¯s ended up a bust. Snap¡¯s growth, too, is tepid, but with product changes on the way, it seems like it still needs to figure out a way to turn that story around.Twitter for most of the year struggled with getting its story out that it¡¯s ready to make product changes and address problems around abuse and harassment that have hounded it for years (and have become increasingly salient this year). But on Monday it said it is starting to enforce new rules around violence and hate, and then an upgrade from a Wall Street firm gave its shares a fresh injection of confidence for investors that are helping it end the year strong rather than limping to the finish line. Twitter shares hit a high on the year earlier this week.Meanwhile, it seems like Snap¡¯s post-IPO period has just been a string of very bad days?as it hasn¡¯t seemed to show the kind of growth that Wall Street expects for the fresh IPO. Granted, newly-minted public companies can have especially volatile stock prices ? we have a couple years to work with for Twitter and less than a year for Snap ? but missing its first quarter out the gate definitely has not helped the company.These stock prices are still important because they¡¯re a near-term barometer of sentiment for the company, but also help the companies offer generous compensation packages for incoming employees. That means they can do a better job of attracting talent, which is key for product-driven companies like Twitter and Snap. Both of these companies, of course, will probably tell you they¡¯re focused on delivering long-term value for shareholders and not paying attention to the day-to-day, but it¡¯s still a moment worth noting in the grand scheme of things."

Unsurprisingly, Amazon makes no mention of YouTube in its announcement today, but for Mozilla, this is surely a smart way of getting a few more users to install its browser."
95,Apps,"Most dating apps match users then leave it up to them to initiate their chat. When Bumble launched, however, it broke new ground by having women make the first move. Today, Hinge is introducing its own take on how conversations on dating apps should be handled with a new feature it¡¯s calling ¡°Your Turn.¡± The idea with ¡°Your Turn¡± is that it lets users decide ? regardless of gender ? who makes the first move, and then reminds users when it¡¯s their turn to respond.In early tests, the company claims the feature helped to reduce ghosting?behavior on its service by 25 percent.Hinge CEO?Justin McLeod explains the idea behind ¡°Your Turn¡± first emerged from focus groups, where users told the company they didn¡¯t always abandon their conversations intentionally. Sometimes, they simply lost track of people in their inbox, or, 23 percent of the time, they just ¡°got busy and forgot.¡±The Hinge team then developed a feature that would better flag conversations you hadn¡¯t responded to yet. This led to the creation of ¡°Your Turn.¡±After the initial match where ¡°Your Turn¡± helps get the conversation off the ground, the feature will then remind users when it¡¯s their ¡°turn¡± to respond the conversation as the chat continues.This addresses one of dating app¡¯s biggest problems ? conversations can often start out well, but then fizzle out and are abandoned. ¡°Your Turn¡± is a little nudge that someone wants to hear back.That said, if the conversation isn¡¯t going well, Hinge users can now choose to hide the match so they can focus on those conversation where things are going better ? that is, where there¡¯s more back-and-forth taking place. This helps to clean up the inbox without requiring users actually unmatch ? something people are sometimes unwilling to do, because¡¦well, you know¡¦just in case.?The end result of ¡°Your Turn¡± is two-fold ? it reduces inbox clutter and makes it clear who¡¯s turn it is to chat next.Also notable is that ¡°Your Turn¡± doesn¡¯t make the choice about who should start the conversation a decision that¡¯s based on users¡¯ gender.¡°[Hinge users said] they¡¯re sick of the rules, the games and being forced to do things they don¡¯t want to do ? on both sides,¡± says McLeod. ¡°What this does is it gives you the same benefit of the clarity in who¡¯s supposed to start the conversation, without forcing one set of rules on you just because of your gender.¡±Hinge says it tested the feature last week in London and Washington, D.C. with tens of thousands of users and found that it decreased the number of matches that don¡¯t lead to a conversation by 25 percent.Of course, with just under a quarter of people saying they ghosted conversations because they got busy or forgot, that means there¡¯s a larger majority who did the same for other reasons ? they started dating someone, perhaps, they weren¡¯t interested¡¦or maybe they¡¯re just a little rude.There¡¯s no real solution for this larger problem, though. It¡¯s just part of dating app culture these days, and one that can inspire negative feelings about the process in general.But McLeod says other changes coming soon to Hinge¡¯s algorithms may help on that front.¡°We pay attention to those kinds of things in the algorithm,¡± he says, in response to a question about how apps should handle people who regularly ghost their matches.¡°We¡¯re going to be rolling out some pretty significant algorithm changes early in the new year,¡± McLeod notes. He says the new algorithm will pay more attention to users¡¯ chatting behavior, and will consider things like whether the person is just matching, but not chatting, or if they¡¯re ghosting.Hinge doesn¡¯t disclose the number of users it has, but says it¡¯s now growing at 15 percent month-over-month, with the majority of downloads from word-of-mouth. Most of its users are also college-educated, with 90 percent of the user base between the ages of 23 and 36. It has the user base doubled in the last 6 months, and it¡¯s now setting up 100,000 dates per month (based on phone numbers being exchanged.)The company has been known to experiment with new ideas in the past. It launched an app for friends that like to play matchmaker and tested a personal assistant service. One of its features ? how users comment on individual pieces of content, such as text posts and photos ? has seemingly inspired Tinder¡¯s test of a news feed that let you react to pots of new photos or other items.Hinge¡¯s ¡°Our Turn¡± feature goes live today in all markets, including the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, and India."
96,Apps,"Apple is said to be working on a way to allow developers to build apps that work with touchscreen input on iPhone and iPad, and with mouse and trackpad on Mac devices, to be implemented next year, according to Bloomberg. The system would unify development environments for both of Apple¡¯s main computing platforms, iOS and macOS, allowing them to target all devices with a single app instead of having to develop separately for each.According to Bloomberg, Apple intends to roll this out as part of the iOS and macOS fall updates (version 12 and 10.14, respectively, if numbering remains in keeping with current versions) that usually arrive for consumers alongside new iPhone hardware in the later part of the year. It could begin making the tools available to developers earlier, however, per the report, in advance of a broad consumer release. Bloomberg suggests we could hear about these plans publicly for the first time at Apple¡¯s annual World Wide Developers Conference in early summer, should they remain on track.Common apps, possibly with a single App Store, could go a long way towards helping improve the situation in the Mac App Store, which has not done nearly as well in terms of consumer reception and library of offerings compared to its iOS counterpart. It would also be a lot easier for users new to both platforms, since they could rest assured that when they get a piece of software in once place, it¡¯ll also work in the other without issue.It¡¯s also on trend in terms of the broader industry ? Google made it possible to run Android apps on its Chrome OS desktop operating system earlier this year, and Windows has had a single OS for its tablet/hybrid and more traditional desktop devices for a while now.Unifying the app layer of both iOS and macOS could also preface a move some anticipate Apple making down the road ? building its own ARM-based chips for powering its notebook and desktop computers. The biggest challenge of switching processor types is typically making sure that all the same software users want remains available, so front-loading that challenge by combining the app platforms while macOS is still on Intel is a good workaround for that."
97,Apps,"Europe¡¯s top court has provided the final verdict on a multi-years legal challenge brought by EU taxi associations to Uber¡¯s claim that it¡¯s just a technology platform ? with the CJEU today ruling it¡¯s a transport service.The judgement means Uber must comply with individual Member States¡¯ transportation regulations, and cannot claim its p2p ride-hailing services are only governed by less restrictive EU-wide ecommerce rules.In its ruling the court writes that Uber¡¯s ¡°intermediation service¡¦ must be regarded as being inherently linked to a transport service and, accordingly, must be classified as ¡®a service in the field of transport¡¯ within the meaning of EU law¡±.¡°Consequently, such a service must be excluded from the scope of the freedom to provide services in general as well as the directive on services in the internal market and the directive on electronic commerce. It follows that, as EU law currently stands, it is for the Member States to regulate the conditions under which such services are to be provided.¡±As we reported earlier this year, an influential advocate general opinion had indicated the decision would not go Uber¡¯s way ? with the CJEU advisor stating that Uber ¡°exerts control over all the relevant aspects of an urban transport service¡±.Responding to the court¡¯s final verdict today, an Uber spokesperson emailed this statement:?¡°This ruling will not change things in most EU countries where we already operate under transportation law. However, millions of Europeans are still prevented from using apps like ours. As our new CEO has said, it is appropriate to regulate services such as Uber and so we will continue the dialogue with cities across Europe. This is the approach we¡¯ll take to ensure everyone can get a reliable ride at the tap of a button.¡±The original legal challenge was filed in 2014 by a professional taxi drivers¡¯ association in Barcelona ? seeking a declaration from that court that the activities of Uber¡¯s Spanish unit amount to misleading practices and acts of unfair competition. In?order to determine that matter, the court decided it needed a judgement on whether the services provided by Uber are transport services, information society services or a combination of both. Hence the case being referred to the CJEU.While the court¡¯s verdict is certainly a blow to Uber¡¯s expansion ambitions in Europe, and will feed back into other legal challenges across the region, the company does already operate under transportation regulations in some European markets, such as London in the UK. (Albeit, it has currently had its license to operate in the city?withdrawn for unrelated reasons.)So Uber¡¯s contention is the legal verdict will not change how it operates in most EU countries.The ruling also only pertains to Uber¡¯s peer-to-peer ride-hailing services ? which have long faced out-and-out bans in multiple European markets, such as France, Spain and Belgium.In some of these EU markets?Uber has gone on to relaunch professional services (i.e. non-p2p ride hailing, using licensed drivers) ? including in Berlin and Madrid ? apparently complying with local transport rules.Although in Spain, at least, local taxi associations are still striking and protesting at the presence of Uber and other ride-hailing firms, claiming that rules which are supposed to limit the number of taxi licenses to operate are being broken.What¡¯s clear now is the CJEU¡¯s decision cements the need for Uber to work with local authorities and regulators in each and every EU market and city where it operates. It also closes the door on Uber being able to restart the engine of p2p ride-hailing expansion in Europe.So any faint hope the company might still have entertained of being given a legal green light to speed down a digital EU fast-lane and overtake local transport interests is gone.Even as taxi association blowback and regulatory and political pressure have already pushed it to conform to existing transport rules in many EU markets.While in others, ¡®hostile¡¯ regulatory climates ? as Uber has characterized it ? have resulted in it pulling its service altogether. Though, more likely, it has just done a cost-benefit analysis and determined that a small market ? like Denmark?? is not worth its while to put in time and lobbying cash to try to flip the regulatory regime to something less restrictive.The company may be hoping that the legal clarity provided by the CJEU¡¯s ruling on ride-hailing apps pushes cities and local authorities to accelerate reforms of existing rules to more generously accommodate the new generation of app-based players. Though existing taxi associations will also be pushing in an equal and opposite direction against any changes they don¡¯t like.New CEO Dara Khosrowshahi does represent a welcome break with the old Uber and its aggressive style of business ? and has signaled a desire to work with local lawmakers, as well as apologizing for Uber¡¯s past mistakes, and managing to sound genuinely contrite and constructive.But the reality for the still profit-less company is that its operational costs only look set to rise from here on in, as legal rulings unpick exploitable loopholes ? at the same time as regulatory roadblocks are cemented in place to close down its old rapid expansion playbook. And as the cost of still emerging liabilities come home to roost.In the UK, for instance, Uber has just lost its first appeal against an employment tribunal verdict that ruled a group of its drivers are workers, not self-employed contractors ? and are therefore entitled to benefits such as holiday pay. Opening the company to additional legal challenges from other drivers.Uber?has said that if it has to fund such benefits for all ~50,000 of its local drivers it would cost its UK business ¡°tens of millions¡± of pounds.The UK government is also looking at changing employment law to reflect ¡°modern¡± gig economy platform work ? and will clearly be keen to protect its tax takings which have been dented by an algorithmically accelerated boom in ¡®self-employment¡¯.¡°Uber?does not charge VAT on the basis that it is for the self-employed drivers who supply the services to register with HMRC to charge VAT,¡± notes Rachel Farr, senior employment lawyer at international law firm Taylor Wessing, commenting on the implications of the ruling in a statement.¡°Now that the ECJ has said that?Uber?itself is a transportation company, that will put further pressure on?Uber?to charge VAT. This would immediately increase the cost of fares by 20%, even before the extra costs such as the minimum wage and paid holiday if the drivers are treated as workers.¡±Add to that politicians in Europe and elsewhere appear increasingly willing to give tech firms a public hosing ? whether it be over tax, safety or wider societal problems being exacerbated by their products ? and there¡¯s a sense that the tide of public opinion is no longer going to be swayed just because you have a shiny app.Even less for Uber whose?reputation has been shredded?in recent years by a string of corporate governance and internal scandals ? including its disclosure last month of a data breach in 2016 affecting 57 million of its users and drivers. Instead of informing regulators when it learnt about the breach, Uber¡¯s then management sought to conceal it by paying off the hackers.That decision is yet another that seems likely to be an expensive one for Uber ? both financially and, perhaps more importantly, in the eyes of the regulators and lawmakers which it increasingly needs to have on side.Its competitors are certainly wasting no time in painting themselves as ¡®constructive disruptors¡¯ and jockeying for favor as more reliable local partners for cities to work with."

The deal will see the Mobike service integrated into the Line app the same way that it is with WeChat in China.Line, which raised $1 billion last year from a dual U.S.-Japan listing, will own less than 20 percent of Mobike Japan, the two companies said.The integration will allow Line users to rent a Mobike bike inside the chat app, simply by scanning the bike¡¯s QR code and paying via their Line Pay account or other payment methods.¡°LINE is the clear leader in Japan¡¯s social media space, with a strong culture of innovation and creativity, and therefore, is the perfect partner to support our ambitious growth plans in Japan,¡±?Hu Weiwei, Founder and President of Mobike, said in a statement. ¡°Working together with LINE, we will be able to provide tens of millions of LINE users with a seamless and localized experience for finding, unlocking and paying for bikes with the LINE app.¡±Mobike moved into Japan in August as part of an ambitious global plan aimed at taking the service to 200 cities worldwide before the end of this year.

99,Apps,"Stitch Fix¡¯s first earnings report is not going well for the company, as its shares went into a tailspin after a significant run up over the past month following its IPO when it delivered its results its most recent fiscal quarter.Stitch Fix, a personalized apparel company that ships a box of recommended items that users can buy or send back, closed up just 1% on its first day of trading?but did not have a good week after it made its public debut. The company downsized its IPO initially, and it looked like things weren¡¯t going well for the company. But in less than a month, the company¡¯s shares swung back and were up more than 50% since it made its debut as bullish sentiment for the holiday season rolled in. Today¡¯s report put the brakes on that and sent the stock into a tailspin.Prior to the company¡¯s earnings report coming out this afternoon, Stitch Fix shares rose around another 4%, but the chart more or less speaks for itself after today¡¯s report as it looks like its huge run in the back half of the year comes to a halt:Stitch Fix was the next big consumer IPO following Blue Apron¡¯s massive collapse after it went public. As such, while the company appeared to build a?sizable business over the course of a few years, it went public under the specter of Blue Apron and faced an enormous amount of scrutiny. It looks like that scrutiny still hasn¡¯t gone anywhere as investors are looking for more positive signals for the recent IPO.In particular, investors are probably going to be looking closely at retention, which Stitch Fix COO Mike Smith says the company is deploying data science to begin focusing on re-engaging its customers and getting them to come back to the service if they end up taking a break. As Stitch Fix expands to new markets like Plus and Men¡¯s, it¡¯s going to be looking to bring that to parity with its core business in terms of the number of items people keep, something Smith said the company has been successful in its Men¡¯s business. The company said it has 2.4 million active clients and turned a net income of $13.5 million.¡°Generally we feel really good about retention and our ability to re-engage clients when they¡¯ve taken a break from us,¡± Smith said. ¡°The difference is we¡¯re now looking at better ways to use data science as it relates to optimizing on both acquiring clients as well as looking at re-engagement activities. With all the data we have we think we can be best-in-class for personalized mentions for bringing them back when they have great products.¡±Stitch Fix is going to have to be able to address a shifting e-commerce industry, especially in apparel, in addition to trying to dodge comparisons to Blue Apron ? the last big consumer IPO. It¡¯s betting big that its data science will be able to create a strong recommendation algorithm for all its emerging businesses, which each increase the total addressable market for the company, as well as find ways to keep users coming back over and over again.The company¡¯s revenue fell roughly in line with Wall Street¡¯s estimates, which was looking for around $295 million in revenue. That¡¯s a more than 25% jump when compared to the same quarter a year earlier. The company said it expects to bring in between $287 million and $294 million in revenue in the quarter ending in January. Here¡¯s a look at the revenue for the company over the past few quarters:Smith said Stitch Fix isn¡¯t really a business that centers around the holidays and that the company is countercyclical ? and the company doesn¡¯t spend a lot on marketing for the quarter or see a big jump in sales. ¡°We are not dependent on our Q4, we deliver client experiences,¡± he said.Snap kicked open the?so-called ¡°IPO window¡± earlier this year, but Snap and Blue Apron both faced an intense amount of scrutiny. Smith said, as you¡¯d expect, that the company doesn¡¯t pay attention to day-to-day swings in its stock and that it¡¯s focused on delivering long-term value for its shareholders. While Stitch Fix could easily be pegged as a successful IPO given its run in the past few months, it¡¯s going to have to figure out ways to ensure that it sells that growth story to Wall Street.Just on a closing note, there was one comment CEO Katrina Lake made on the earnings call that may raise a couple eyebrows in terms of how the company¡¯s numbers look when it comes to thinking about patterns for Stitch Fix¡¯s business:¡°We had a warmer fall, we were selling through that summer product later this year,¡± Lake said. ¡°We were selling through mostly at full price through September and weeks when you wouldn¡¯t normally see that. We saw some benefits from that.¡±"

Then you may be interested to know that Instagram has launched Alpha testing programs on iOS and Android aimed at those who want to test pre-release versions of its popular photo-sharing app.Instagram has been running an Android Beta program for a couple of years now. Here, things like account switching and multi-photo album posts ? now standard Instagram features ? made their debut.The company¡¯s newly launched Alpha program will offer a different version of the app to testers than is available to Beta testers, however, so users may get to test features that never even make it to the next step up, much less the wider public.The site Android Police first caught wind of the Android Alpha program¡¯s launch, after spotting a post from an Instagram employee (which has since been removed) on Reddit. The post was soliciting participants for the program by offering a link to join. Commenters on Reddit then turned the thread into a series of feature requests, begging for things like an option for a reverse-chronological feed, a dark theme, and ¡°regramming¡± support ? meaning, reposting someone else¡¯s photo with attribution.Of course, who knows what Instagram may actually end up testing as this Alpha program gets going. (Email me if you find something good!)While news of the Alpha program was just uncovered, it¡¯s not exactly brand-new. The program actually launched two weeks ago, we understand. But Instagram didn¡¯t make a formal announcement about its availability, so its existence is new information to many.An Instagram spokesperson confirmed the Alpha program¡¯s launch to TechCrunch, in a statement.¡°We recently introduced Alpha programs for our iOS and Android versions of Instagram in addition to the Beta program we¡¯ve had on Android for awhile,¡± they said. These programs are ¡°a great way to collect feedback from the community,¡± they added.The testing programs aren¡¯t really meant to be a secret, but they¡¯re also not broadly advertised. Those who like to join alpha and beta groups generally tend to know where to look for them ? for example, by signing up for test builds of apps on the Google Play Store.In fact, Google even made this easier for developers and consumers alike with last year¡¯s launch of the ¡°Early Access¡± feature, which centralizes apps open for testing in a dedicated tab in the mobile version of the Play Store.Larger companies like Instagram don¡¯t always use this option, though.In Instagram¡¯s case, for example, the process of joining the Alpha program involves becoming a member of this?Google Group, then joining the Instagram testing program on the Play Store, according to Android Police¡¯s report.Unfortunately, the iOS program is not taking any additional requests to join at this time.Instagram isn¡¯t the only Facebook app with a testing program. Facebook?launched its own pre-release program back in 2013. Other major tech companies, including Twitter and Google, run programs of their own, as well."

Today, the acquisition has completed, with Musical.ly officially joining Bytedance, the companies said. In addition, Musical.ly announced the launch of a $50 million ¡°Creator Fund¡± that will be used to invest in education, training and community enrichment on the Musical.ly platform, as well as to aid in the discovery and development of new talent.Musical.ly says it plans to invest via this new fund over the next two years, and gave some examples of the programs it aims to support.This includes a college scholarship fund that will dole out money to be put towards relevant university programs, like those focused on video storytelling and digital media. These scholarships and grants may include some requirements beyond being the ¡°best¡± talent on Musical.ly ? like academic performance and attendance records, for example.Another program involves the launch of a marketplace where creators will be able to exchange and sell assets like AR objects or original music to others, plus participate in online workshops and collaborate with brands.Shifting the development of AR objects to the wider community is something Snapchat did this month as well, when it launched its AR developer platform, Lens Studio. The advantage in opening up to outside developers is that the social app can more quickly roll out new AR experiences to its wider user base. Musical.ly is now going this same route, it seems.In Musical.ly¡¯s marketplace, the plan is to offer a centralized resource where any goods ? whether physical, virtual, or knowledge-based ? can be sold.Another of the fund¡¯s efforts is the Co-innovation Partner Program, which will involve collaboration with select media and content partners to develop new formats and technologies for mobile video storytelling.Other programs will be focused on finding Musical.ly¡¯s next big stars and further their growth.The company has had some successes so far ? it mentions 19-year old dancer and singer Lucki Starr as one example, and 25-year old comedian Wesley Russell as another. However, a large part of its user base remains the very young ? kids and teens ? something that has been problematic for it in the past, due to the under-13 nature of many of its users.The company clarifies in its announcement today that it will seek out creators who are ¡°largely college-aged¡± and older for these initiatives.¡°Our vision is to inspire the world to create, and we¡¯re excited to offer our users the ability to express their creativity, advance their talents, and even make a living on musical.ly,¡± said Alex Zhu, co-founder of Musical.ly, in a statement.¡°From everyday creators to established influencers, our users make musical.ly a dynamic and entertaining video community for millions of people around the world. The musical.ly Creator Fund illustrates our commitment to supporting the growth and development of our creators and expanding the opportunities available to the creator community, both inside and beyond the app,¡± he added.Zhu, along with co-founder Louis Yang, will continue to run Musical.ly following the close of the deal, which is also now bringing the app to a significantly wider potential audience.At the time of the acquisition, Musical.ly had some 60 million users, most of whom were based in the U.S. By joining Bytedance, the app will become available to that company¡¯s user base in China, Japan, Korea, and elsewhere in Asia.Bytedance¡¯s Toutiao claims 120 million daily active users, to give you an idea of scale.The ability to reach these sizable markets was one of the key factors driving the acquisition. Even though Musical.ly had headquarters in Shanghai, it hadn¡¯t yet been able to grow in that region. Musical.ly will also take advantage of Bytedance¡¯s artificial intelligence technology, which was used to build Toutiao¡¯s News Feed, the companies had also said.?"
102,Apps,"Toby Russell was one of the first people to get Shift founder George Arison into used cars ? and now he¡¯s going to be running his company alongside him as Shift said today it is appointing Russell co-CEO of the company.Arison said he was naming Russell co-CEO of the used car marketplace to help split off the role into what each executive would be best at, with Russell handling a lot of the internal operational side of things while Arison works on handling things like hiring, business development and managing its fundraising. It was a bit like trying to hammer a square peg into a round hole with Arison trying to handle everything all at once in areas he wasn¡¯t completely passionate about, he said, so that¡¯s why they decided to make the change.¡°We wanted an environment where we had these two swim lanes, and each person was able to execute in each one so we¡¯re ensuring that there is success and management,¡± Arison said. ¡°It¡¯s very seldom where founders are very good at the same time as being big company managers. Most of the time it does not work out really well, that¡¯s a reality. The skills that make you a really good founder don¡¯t make you a very good executive on a large scale. Those are two very different skills.¡±Russell has been with the company for more than two years?and already held a big operational role within Shift prior to getting the title here. Shift called on a few people to assess what was going on internally at the company, Arison said, and the conclusion was to bring up Russell up as co-CEO of the company and hand over a lot of the management duties over to him.While the notion of a founder perhaps not being the best to run a company as it begins to scale, a co-CEO setup is somewhat irregular as founders will often hand the keys over to a CEO who¡¯s better at an operational level. But it has worked before, as is the case with Atlassian, which went public a few years ago and has had a pretty successful run since making its debut.Shift¡¯s area is certainly a challenging one, with a very obvious bust in the space in the form of Beepi (which raised $150 million). Having that kind of a specter weighing on the company as it is pressured to figure out the business of building a new used car marketplace may, in the end, require a rethinking of how its run internally so it is able to continue to come up with new products and strategies to continue to grow.It doesn¡¯t mean there¡¯s any transition in progress to Russell as the sole CEO, Arison said, as he will handle the very public-facing elements of the company that were mentioned above. Instead, the move was more about installing ¡°divisions of labor,¡± he said, to make the whole internal processes more efficient, being a part of the big strategy meetings and handling the rest while Russell handles more of the day-to-day.¡°I¡¯m here full-time, 16 hours a day every day,¡± Arison said. ¡°That¡¯s not in any way changing. I still have some very big deliverables for the business that I¡¯m responsible for on a daily basis. We have a very clear division of labor, we¡¯re calling those George¡¯s lanes and Toby¡¯s lanes. The exciting thing for me is I¡¯m now gonna be able to focus more time in some areas where previously I would not be able to focus.¡±"
103,Apps,"Facebook wants to make sure you know about and control the photos of you people upload, even if they don¡¯t tag you. So today, Facebook launched a new facial recognition feature called Photo Review that will alert you when your face shows up in newly posted photos so you can tag yourself, leave it be, ask the uploader to take the photo down, or report it to Facebook.The feature should give people confidence that there aren¡¯t pics of them floating around Facebook that they could see but just don¡¯t know about. It could also help thwart impersonation. But Facebook tells me it has no plans to use facial recognition to enhance ad targeting or content relevancy sorting, like showing you more News Feed posts from friends who post untagged photos of you or ads related to locations where you appear in untagged photos.If you¡¯re in someone¡¯s profile photo which is always public, you¡¯ll always be notified. For other photos, you¡¯ll only get notified if you¡¯re in the audience for that photo so as to protect the uploader¡¯s privacy and not alert you about photos you¡¯re not allowed to see. A Photo Review section of the profile will keep track of all your untagged but recognized photos.Facebook¡¯s applied machine learning?product manager Nipun Mather tells me the feature is designed to give people more control, make them feel safer, and provide opportunities for nostalgia.Facebook is also adding a new overarching photo and video facial recognition opt out privacy setting that will delete its face template of you and deactivate the new Photo Review feature as well as the old Tag Suggestions that used facial recognition to speed up tagging when friends posted a photo of you. These will all roll out everywhere over the next few weeks except in Europe and Canada where privacy laws prohibit Facebook¡¯s facial recognition tech.Facebook is also using the feature to assist the vision impaired. Now Facebook¡¯s machine vision-powered feature that describes what¡¯s in a photo will also read aloud the names of untagged friends.¡°Over time our goal is to make these features available everywhere . . . but right now we¡¯re focusing on markets where tag suggestions are available¡± says Facebook¡¯s Deputy Chief Privacy Officer Rob Sherman.While Tag Suggestions might be seen as weakening privacy, Photo Review could be perceived as enhancing it and might get a pass from regulators. Whether it¡¯s an unauthorizied photo of you that you want taken off Facebook, an embarrassing pic you don¡¯t want tagged but want to monitor comments on, or someone trying to pretend to be you, Photo Review gives people more visibility into how their likeness is used."

Apple CEO Tim Cook?announced Apple¡¯s plan to allow Amazon¡¯s app on Apple TV at the company¡¯s Worldwide Developer Conference in June, noting that the app would go live before year-end.According to Apple TV App Store data provided by Sensor Tower, the Amazon Prime Video app has ranked number one in the free apps chart since its launch, and remains in the top position now in the U.S. and all other regions where it¡¯s available.In addition, App Annie reports that the Amazon Prime Video app saw its largest week in terms of iOS downloads ever ? another signal related to the Apple TV launch. While the firm isn¡¯t yet able to provide tvOS download estimates, the bump in downloads likely correlates to the Apple TV debut. That is, as people add the app to their TV where they do much of their viewing, they may add it to their mobile devices, as well, in order to continue watching shows and movies where they left off.¡°Globally, Amazon Prime Video saw its largest week of iOS downloads ever during the week of December 3rd through 9th, 2017 seeing well over 550,000 iOS downloads,¡± App Annie told TechCrunch. This represents a 45 percent increase in global weekly downloads, compared the average of the four weeks prior, it said.¡°Following a large global release on tvOS on December 6th, 2017, Amazon Prime Video has also seen a strong spike in downloads of its iPhone and iPad app. This was driven both by releases in new markets like the U.K. and Germany and upticks in markets where it is already well established like the U.S.,¡± the firm added.Amazon historically has played tough with rivals, banning devices like Apple TV, Chromecast, Google Home, and others from its online store in order to boost sales of its own hardware. The retailer recently has been feuding with Google, too, leading to Google pulling its YouTube player from Echo Show and Fire TV.But things are changing quickly ? the Chromecast, along with Apple TV, were spotted earlier this month on Amazon, indicating a positive shift in discussions between Google and Amazon, as well as the final step in Apple and Amazon¡¯s deal."
105,Apps,"InVision, the platform for creation and collaboration among designers, has today announced the launch of the InVision Fund.Led by CEO Clark Valberg, the company is designating $5 million to invest in startups working in the design space.¡°The world is giving birth to all of these little design tools meant to make the world of design better,¡± said Valberg. ¡°We think of InVision as the Salesforce of the design world, giving us the opportunity to embrace and integrate and click design customers into one seamless workflow.¡±As part of the fund, InVision will participate in equity investment in net new design tools. That might include participating in rounds led by institutional VCs or investing in ¡°things worth incubating ourselves,¡± according to Valberg.InVision also sees the opportunity to give $100K to $300K grants to folks building plug-ins specifically for the InVision platform.InVision hit the scene in 2011 looking for a way to give designers rapid prototyping tools. Once upon a time, designers and engineers would go back and forth for weeks or months to get a product¡¯s functionality and aesthetics on the same page.With the ability to add animations and transitions, designers could share their work with the entire organization or external clients to get feedback.The company has since grown to service 80 percent of the Fortune 100, according to InVision, with over 3 million users at companies like Airbnb, Disney, and Nike. Moreover, 70 percent of InVision users aren¡¯t designers, showing just how important design is across an entire organization.In October, InVision announced the launch of Studio, a design product meant to take on the likes of Photoshop and Sketch. And in November, InVision raised $100 million in Series E funding. As part of the Studio launch, Valberg mentioned the opportunity to sell mini-tools and content within a Studio application store.The InVision fund is meant to foster the design community as InVision grows. But, perhaps more importantly, InVision¡¯s investment in smaller design tools could put them in a power position within the greater design ecosystem. Adobe also has a venture fund with portfolio companies that include Shutterfly, Netscape, and Sendmail.Alongside Valberg, the InVision fund will also be led by Stephen Olmstead, the Vice President of Design Partnerships at InVision, as well as FirstMark Capital¡¯s Amish Jani."
106,Apps,"Twitter is finally having a good day on Wall Street as it heads into the final weeks of the year, and this time around it may be a result of a little bit of optimism from investors.There were two big moves for the company today: first, Twitter said it would begin enforcing new rules related to how it handles hateful and abusive content on the platform, which is a problem that has been hounding Twitter for years (and has been increasingly salient in the past year). But the second, which is more likely to be the bump for the stock, is an upgraded rating for the stock from a big Wall Street Firm. JP Morgan issued a note that showed some positive sentiment for the company, which as it has struggled on Wall Street is something it likely sorely needed.Twitter¡¯s stock jumped nearly 10% this morning ? adding a few billion dollars to its market cap. That¡¯s put it within striking distance of Snap, a similarly vulnerable social (or communications) network, which has also faced significant issues selling itself to Wall Street with limited user growth. Here¡¯s a look at what happened:If things keep going the way they are, Twitter may?finish the year up around 30%. Since going public, Twitter has struggled to show Wall Street that it can grow at the same clip as Facebook and keep its?abuse problems under control. The growth problem is also one Snap has faced when trying to sell itself to investors. Getting that stock price up does a number of things for the company, including helping it pitch potential candidates with better compensation packages and keep activist investors away from agitating change in the company.Shares of public companies like Twitter, which can be incredibly volatile and subject to major swings on reports like their quarterly earnings, can see some significant shifts as a result of rating changes from Wall Street firms. Twitter has seen some significant swings throughout the year, but it looks like it may be ending on a positive note. Twitter can live and die by those changes in its monthly active users, but the company has tried to pitch Wall Street on alternative growth stories like video.As of this morning, Snap had a market cap of around $19.5 billion, which Twitter is now within shooting distance. Twitter¡¯s product updates have been a kind of drip-drip-drip, with major changes looking more like expanding its character count to 280 for Tweets ? and it¡¯s faced issues with not keeping up with harassment?on the platform. In response to all this, Twitter is adjusting its approach to its policies that are focused on curbing problems like abuse and hate speech, including the updates today."
107,Apps,"Reddit today is giving its mobile apps a major upgrade ? the first since their launch last year, when the company decided to take back control over the official Reddit experience on mobile ? an experience that had long been available mainly through third-party clients. Today¡¯s updated apps introduce a number of new features focused on media consumption ? including how it handles photos, videos and GIFs ? plus the addition of things like live comment feeds, in-app chat, tools for moderators and more.Some of the features seem inspired by work from other third-party clients.For example, the new Theater Mode option on iOS lets users browse media in what Reddit calls a ¡°video-first¡± format. This allows users to open media, like original video, in a full-screen experience. They can also choose to view the content in landscape mode and swipe back and forth between media.While this is an obvious next step for Reddit on mobile, it¡¯s worth noting that a full-screen media mode is one of the features that made the new third-party Reddit app, Apollo, so well-received earlier this year. (Apollo¡¯s media mode doesn¡¯t let you scroll to the next image, however.)Similarly, the ability to open links in Safari (via Safari View Controller) on iOS instead of using Reddit¡¯s native in-app browser is another feature you can find in Apollo. This has also been among one of users¡¯ top requests, Reddit says.Other features, however, push the Reddit clients into new territory while leveraging their position as the official mobile apps.For example, Reddit¡¯s iOS app will now support live comments, turning Reddit into a more real-time experience, and making it feel similar to Twitter.Employees have tested this feature for some time ahead of today¡¯s arrival, but now it¡¯s becoming publicly available. The feature makes sense for a variety of posts, whether that¡¯s real-time comment threads on NFL gameday posts, or updates about natural disasters and aid as on?the Hurricane Harvey megathread.iOS is also the first official Reddit app to get chat.This feature has also been in beta testing ahead of today with thousands of Reddit users across the site. Now, as chat becomes available on mobile, users can choose to opt in the beta (but only for 1 to 1 chats for the time being.)Several other new features are designed to make Reddit¡¯s apps more functional, while others are about building community.Users and moderators can now add ¡°post flair¡± on both iOS and Android ? a tool to distinguish different types of content. A new comment speed read button on Android lets users jump between the top-level comments in a discussion. Another change ensures that the original poster (OP)¡¯s username is always visible, even from the Home feed.Meanwhile, both iOS and Android users will enjoy a cake icon by their name on their ¡°Cake Day¡± ? a Reddit tradition that celebrates a user¡¯s anniversary of when they first joined the site. Users¡¯ trophy case ? which displays accomplishments like best comment, beta test participation, length of time on Reddit and more ? will also now be displayed on mobile.Another group of features launching today are designed for Reddit¡¯s moderators.This includes the ability to switch on ¡°Mod mode¡± to approve, remove, and flag content from iOS and Android ? or even bulk approve, remove, or flag items, for those in charge of larger communities. Moderators can also access the beta and existing Modmail experiences, and can update the list of moderators and approved submitters from their phone, across both iOS and Android.Reddit says it has simplified other moderator tasks, too, like banning, muting and reporting.The company¡¯s decision to focus more heavily on mobile with the launch of its own native apps -which also replace the app it acquired, Alien Blue ? came about because of the increasing influx of mobile users and mobile-first users.At the time of the launch, Reddit said that half its user base browsed the site on mobile, including both via mobile web and third-party applications. It knew that it needed to better serve those users by staking its own claim on mobile where it could more carefully craft the user experience it wanted to deliver.Today, Reddit says it has over 330 million monthly active users, who post more than 9 million times per month, and ~370,000 times per day. It also notes that younger users prefer mobile, with 58 percent of those 18 through 34 preferring mobile web and mobile apps only. Pageview growth across Reddit has doubled since early 2016, and mobile engagement is higher than on desktop, the company also notes.In addition, Reddit generates revenue through advertising, including on mobile. To do so effectively, it needs to have more control over the native app experience in order to offer features for advertisers such as?the recently introduced support for mobile app attribution through integrations with partners like Tune, Adjust and Kochava for app install ads, or just to simply better cater to advertisers who want to target mobile in particular.The new Reddit apps are going live today on the iOS App Store and Google Play."
108,Apps,"Open Garden launched its mesh networking platform at TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2012. Since then, the company has gone through a few iterations and found unexpected success in its Firechat offline messaging service. Now, it¡¯s ready for the next step in its evolution. The company now wants to make it easier for anybody with an Android phone to share their Wi-Fi connections with anyone who is nearby. And to incentivize people to do so, the company plans to launch its own Ethereum token (called OG¡¦) in early 2018.The company bills this as the launch of a ¡°decentralized Internet Service Provider (ISP).¡± You still need a regular ISP to become an Open Garden ISP, so I admit that the whole concept doesn¡¯t quite seem right to me. Unsurprisingly, Open Garden CEO Paul Hainsworth (who took over from the company¡¯s founded CEO in early 2016) doesn¡¯t see it that way. ¡°The concept of a decentralized ISP is entirely new,¡± he told me. ¡°The traditional, centralized ISP is a one-to-many relationship between provider and customer. A decentralized ISP is the combination of millions of individual people, companies and products creating a new kind of network. These millions of people sharing their internet are ISPs, tiny or large, and in aggregate they form a decentralized ISP.¡±The argument here is that most people only use a small amount of their broadband connection¡¯s bandwidth cap. So why not share this access with others and earn some OG in the process? While Open Garden argues that this is a totally new concept, the likes of Fon and others have long enabled WiFi sharing without the need for Ethereum tokens and mesh networks. Most have done so with mixed success, likely because few people actually want to share their internet access.A decentralized network like this can also only work if enough people participate. Open Garden is trying to jumpstart this process by using its FireChat app to bootstrap this process. The company says its messaging service has over 5 million registered users and they will form the basis for seeding this network. Over time, Open Garden also plans to add apps for iOS, Mac, Windows and set-top streaming boxes. ¡°Project Open Garden, our open source project, will enable developers to build OG into their own apps and hardware solutions,¡± the company argues. ¡°OG can be used by existing WiFi infrastructure owners ? such as municipal WiFi, shopping malls, stadiums, airports, restaurants, and small businesses ? to monetize their existing capital investment.¡±And why use tokens (besides, I assume, that this is obviously a hip thing to do right now)? ¡°Our intent is to enable regular consumers to buy internet access without having to understand anything about crypto, blockchains or anything technical,¡± Hainsworth told me. He also argues that tokens are a good way to incentivize growth. ¡°By issuing our own token, instead of just using Bitcoin or Ethereum, we can give away a very large percentage of the total tokens (or coins) in our economy to participants,¡± he noted. ¡°We do this to incentivize network growth, user acquisition and retention. Incentives work at an individual level. Early adopters can earn additional bonus OG for being first to market, for example.¡±So if all the incentive you ever needed to share your internet connection with random strangers was a bit of Ethereum OG, then your dreams have come true. The Open Garden app is now available for download in the Google Play store."

Now run by Indonesian telco Emtek, BBM?still maintains a decentish following in Indonesia, other parts of Asia, Africa and the Middle East.The ride-hailing company is rolling out this tie-in with BBM to allow users to book a ride from inside the chat app within the ¡®discover¡¯ menu. The feature will go live in selected countries in?Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, and the Middle East, Uber said.Indonesia, the world¡¯s fourth most populous country, seems an obvious target for this. Uber is behind both Grab and Go-Jek in Indonesia, which is the largest economy in Southeast Asia, a region?where ride-hailing is said to have reached $5.1 billion this year with much growth ahead. This feature isn¡¯t about to close that gap, but it is at least a logical move for Uber. It¡¯s also a logical move from BBM which also needs to compete ? it has seen itself slowly squeezed by the rise of WhatsApp, Messenger and other chat apps.The BBM partnership makes use of Uber¡¯s web-based app ??m.uber ? which offers features you¡¯d find in a regular app but comes suited to poor quality connections and lower-end devices."

Alexia Tsotsis is a big nerd who is working on something under the radar. Before this she was at business school and before that she was at TechCrunch.He did not expect his side hustle¡¯s sudden popularity, and definitely did not expect it to attract 275K monthly active users, $300K in revenue and roughly 300K in downloads for the month of November 2017, according to Apptopia, which also estimates the app¡¯s average revenue per user at a solid $0.99. (Yama disputes Apptopia¡¯s estimates, and holds that the app saw 400K downloads in the month of October alone.)At tha ltd., Yama has worked on projects for Shiseido and a Japanese men¡¯s gymnastics team. He insists that his Kirakira discovery wasn¡¯t inspired by his job, but rather by a starry-eyed quest to create photorealistic OpenGL and Shaers effects in a real-time app.Kentaro pushing the envelope in real time ¡¦¡¦ versus his rebelliousness in CG.So what propelled Kirakira, which means ¡°sparkly¡± in Japanese, from the dregs of the App Store to the home screens of any influencer worth their weight in Likes?¡°The effect is easy to understand ? and fun,¡± Yama writes to me. But that doesn¡¯t explain why Kirakira wasn¡¯t really discovered until this past September, where fashion lore has it that Instagram head of partnerships Eva Chen fortuitously found it and started using it during Spring/Summer ¡®18 Fashion Week.While the Instagram press team has not responded to our request for comment, Chen is very likely ¡°patient zero¡± of the app. ¡°I was very, very surprised,¡± Yama tells me about seeing the app suddenly take off two months ago. ¡°Since the number of downloads increased, I updated the function that I thought needed. Beyond [what I imagined,] people like to shine,¡± he muses poetically.Yama came across the inspiration for Kirakira while still working at his day job, building post-production lighting effects at tha?ltd.Yama had a hunch that the effervescent, enhanced lighting would also suit the phone¡¯s camera and thus built an app with the same effect but in real time. But nothing came of it for years, until this fall¡¯s Spring/Summer Fashion Week (yes, I know how weird this sounds but that¡¯s a whole other post).Humbled by his success, Yama is aware of the fact that there is already a plethora of filter applications. And he is concerned about the existential threat posed by Instagram and Facebook, which infamously have no qualms about stomping on the competition.¡°Yeah, I am a little worried about that,¡± he explains. ¡°I think the new feature Kirakiragraph is a good idea. I [will be] sorry if this is also copied.¡±Yama thinks it might be a competitive advantage that Kirakira sticks to being solely focused on the amplification of light versus, you know, usurping your entire social graph.Apptopia statsWith a starring role in Kirakira¡¯s latest update on November 13th, Kirakiragraph is a photograph that only moves light, a prescient launch as we slowly approach the most lit holidays of the year: Christmas and New Year¡¯s Eve.The update also allows you to get the Kirakira effect on still images, which online-focused brands like Iconery are already using Photoshop to imitate.Yama would not share his own download metrics, and said he had no data about the app¡¯s daily and monthly active users. Same with its revenue and profit, though he told me that the numbers on Apptopia are approximate. His future plans include building an Android version of Kirakira, but not a social network. He¡¯s never thought about taking VC money.Yama is awed that world-famous people like Kim Kardashian are using his app.¡°The world is too different for me.¡± Still Yama says that none of the celebrities using Kirakira has reached out to him, yet. ¡°Although it is not, there are several stories about collaboration with companies,¡± he explains.He sees a lot of opportunity for AR to influence fashion the way Kirakira has and beyond. ¡°Because CG will be more suitable for photoreal expression, I think that CG and cameras will become more familiar, and more various expressions will be born as AR,¡± he explains.And while Kirakira is purposefully simple, there is room for more complex AR interplay within the worlds of beauty and fashion: Both Sephora and Mac leverage the Modiface SDK and allow you to try on a cat eye or a glitter lip without the consequent mess. Apps like Fabby Look?help you to change your iHair color and there are a?cornucopia of apps that allow you to have digital surgery (for better or for worse, per Amanda Hess).It¡¯s only a matter of time ? and advances in AI, CV and CG ? before similar semantic image-recognition tech is also applied to the color of your clothes or the shape of your entire body ? shout out to David Foster Wallace¡¯s vision of dystopian avatar tech.If Amazon¡¯s recent acquisition of Body Labs is an indicator, the tech MAFIA is already working on apps that make an all-red or all-yellow or all-fur outfit pack even more of a punch in social media photos, which are increasingly the only metric that matters.

111,Apps,"Netflix had a pretty good year by very Netflix-y standards: it added a ton of subscribers; its international growth plans seem to be playing out as hoped; it cleaned up in the Golden Globe nominations, and users are watching a?ton of Netflix.While the company has continued to show growth with its existing strategy ? investing a ton in?its original content strategy in the hope that it¡¯ll convert Emmy and Grammy awards into subscribers ? it¡¯s going to get more expensive. Netflix has basically acknowledged that as it says it¡¯s going to ramp up its original content and marketing spend, and in October said it would raise up to $1.6 billion in debt. In short, its strategy that worked this year will, in theory, play out next year as it looks to continue putting out strong original shows.The company has said it expects to spend between $7 billion and $8 billion on original content, a clear sign that it¡¯s going to double down on that strategy that seems to have given it a pretty successful strategy in 2017. It had to raise prices, which could create a bigger barrier to consumers. But if all goes well, a successful repeat of that strategy ? which means it has to continue to come out with great shows ? will help it continue to grow where it needs.The company¡¯s performance as a whole has made it look quite good for Wall Street. Netflix¡¯s share price has risen more than 50% in the past year. That carries with it a whole batch of benefits: it looks great as a public barometer for the company, it means the company can woo talent with good compensation packages, and it keeps away activist investors that are looking to agitate change in the company. The whole time this is happening, Netflix¡¯s content costs are ballooning, but that seems to have yet to faze investors.And that¡¯s a group that, for better or worse, Netflix needs to keep happy. Netflix is going to have to grapple with an increasingly competitive group including Hulu and Amazon, which are now churning out shows that are getting similar accolades to Netflix¡¯s best series. Hulu came out with The Handmaid¡¯s Tale, which received high praise, showing that there¡¯s an opportunity to go after Netflix¡¯s sweet spot with its own original content.If Netflix is going to have a repeat of 2017, it¡¯s going to have to figure out how to both keep picking up users (with a strategy that seems to be working in place) and keep them from flipping to other services. Each service offers some unique original content, but they also have huge backlogs of content that serve as the backbone of a video streaming service. With rising prices, Netflix has to ensure that it makes good shows, but also ensure that it creates an experience that keeps people coming back to watch ? whether that¡¯s through improvements in its?recommendation engine or a robust backlog of content that it can keep signing on.Netflix passed a pretty significant milestone when it comes to its international expansion plans: (slightly) more than half of its subscribers now come from outside the U.S. Its users are watching around 1 billion hours of content per week (that¡¯s billion-with-a-B). Its spending on original content appears to be working there, too, with internationally-oriented shows like?3%. Its user base appears to be growing, though it¡¯s not clear when it¡¯ll hit that absolute saturation point where it has to start figuring out what the next generation of products looks like.That may be something along the lines of allowing offline viewing of some shows, which it began in November this year, or it may be improved recommendation engines to help a user discover that they like Twin Peaks as much as they¡¯d like American Vandal. Either way, it still seems like there¡¯s an overhead that Netflix hasn¡¯t quite hit yet as it continues to beat Wall Street¡¯s ? and its own ? expectations for subscriber growth.So we¡¯ll see if the company is not only able to continue to churn out that content but also actually have the capital to stick to that aggressive spending plan it set for itself. That, and it probably needs to stop creeping on its members."

But it now looks like Softbank is in talks to invest around $300 million in the dog-walking app. Softbank has been aggressively investing large sums of capital in various startups in Silicon Valley and it seems like the company has taken a strong interest in the app after it sought to raise a big round of funding.Despite the potentially huge funding round, Wag has been in the middle of some intense criticism following a big story from Bloomberg which identified some issues with the company. There are always significant challenges when offloading some activities, like dog-walkers, to an on-demand marketplace, but it looks like that hasn¡¯t been enough to wave off potential interest by investors.Wag will,?of course, face a lot of competition going forward and raising a lot of capital can help it get ahead of that competition. You¡¯ll probably spot a few billboards in very dog-heavy cities (like San Francisco), where the app could find a lucrative business opportunity. But there are also other pet-sitting businesses (which aren¡¯t explicitly just dog-walking apps) like Rover, which actually merged with DogVacay earlier this year.Wag launched in San Francisco in 2015?but has since launched a big list of cities that include Houston, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh. In dozens of cities, Wag will have to aggressively spend to acquire new customers, whether that¡¯s through digital advertising like Facebook or Google ads or traditional advertising like billboards.As is normal with all of these conversations, the terms of the deal could change or the talks could even fall apart, which Recode also indicates.?Axios also?reported that Softbank was interested in the company in its Pro Rata newsletter.We¡¯ve reached out to Wag comment and will update the story when we hear back.

113,Apps,"Fitbit is, once again, not having a good day after spending the year in mostly middling status as it looks to prove there¡¯s a market for fitness trackers as well as its own smartwatch.The culprit today is a Wall Street firm slapping a ¡°sell¡± rating on the company¡¯s stock, which often results in a resounding rejection of its potential going forward and sparks a sharp drop-off in the company¡¯s share value. Fitbit fell around 8.5 percent this morning after a year that tried to recover from a steep decline at the beginning of the year amid uncertainty around its business.Here¡¯s a look at what happened:Fitbit¡¯s now down more than 16 percent in the last year. Volatile companies are often vulnerable to these kinds of swings as a result of Wall Street firms rating the shares, which can range from recommendations to buy or sell the stock based on its performance or analysis of its potential business.For Fitbit, that¡¯s bad news, because the company needs to keep its share price up as companies can use shares as part of compensation packages when they try to hire new people. There¡¯s also always a morale component, as the stock price is a very public-facing barometer of the company¡¯s performance (even if people try to argue against its importance), and one that can wave off potential talent that would be interested in joining the company.The last update we got from Fitbit was a slew of apps coming to its Ionic smartwatch, which included the addition of apps like Yelp and Uber. But as Apple continues to retool the Apple Watch with new features for health tracking, which appears to be working in a way to detect some common conditions according to a study from UCSF, it¡¯ll face increasing competition when people look at it as a health tracker."

115,Apps,"Uber has announced it¡¯s launching a free insurance package for independent couriers delivering food for its Uber Eats business in nine European markets.It says all couriers with an active account in the covered markets will be able to take up the product free of charge.The plan will be introduced from?January 8, 2018, and will include personal accident insurance during a delivery trip; a cash benefit for severe sickness or injury up to a maximum of 15 days; and third party liability cover up to a maximum of ¢æ1M.The ride-hailing giant has partnered with?AXA Corporate Solutions for the bespoke insurance product ? which it says will provide ¡°additional protection and security¡± for couriers delivering for its Uber Eats service in Austria, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the UK.Earlier this year, in April, Uber launched a subsidized personal injury and illness insurance for drivers in the UK ? though that product was not entirely free of charge, costing drivers who were eligible ?2 per week to join the scheme.Food delivery couriers that are working busy roads on bicycles and mopeds are visibly taking the biggest risks to their personal safety ? which likely explains why Uber is fully subsidizing the Uber Eats insurance package.Uber and other gig economy companies have also faced growing pressure in Europe over employment conditions and rights for the individuals providing the core services offered by their platforms as legal challenges have successfully unpicked multiple ¡®self-employed¡¯ classifications.In?October last year a UK employment tribunal ruled that a group of Uber drivers had worker status ? meaning they are entitled to workers rights such as holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the National Minimum Wage.Last month Uber lost its first appeal against that judgement, and had an?application to take an appeal straight to the UK¡¯s supreme court denied ? leaving it the option of going to the UK¡¯s Court of Appeals.At the same time a?decision by Europe¡¯s top court ? in a separate case concerning a self-employed window salesman who was determined to have worker status ? appears to have raised the stakes considerably because it did not time-limit potential claims for backpay. Meaning that across the EU, over the longer term, the financial incentive for employers to deny workers entitlement to holiday pay will be reduced ? given the risk if they get a classification wrong could mean having to pay out for an entire, multi-years employment term.Meanwhile, in the UK, the government has been looking at whether it needs to change employment law to take account of modern working practices, such as app-enabled gig economy jobbing.The government commissioned an independent review of modern working practices, which was?published?in July, and included recommendations such as creating a new classification for workers on tech platforms to separate them from what it dubbed the ¡°legitimately self-employed¡±.Though it¡¯s still not yet clear which of the review¡¯s recommendations it might act on.In October?a UK parliamentary committee questioned representatives from Uber and Deliveroo ? including quizzing the companies on sick pay and whether they are always paying the national minimum wage.Uber told the UK committee that should it have to fund workers rights for all circa 50,000 self-employed drivers on its platform in the UK it would cost the business ¡°tens of millions¡± of pounds.Given all this legal and political noise around gig economy rights, Uber¡¯s moves in Europe to begin offering insurance products appear geared towards trying to shrink its liabilities as well as ease political pressure and steer off the risk of a major regulatory clampdown that could enforce rights across the board for gig economy workers.The Uber Eats courier insurance package is one of several initiatives between Uber and AXA, according to the company.Uber also claims it¡¯s ¡°the first of its kind to provide protection across multiple countries¡±.In the event of an accident it says the courier will ¡°simply have to fill in an online claim form available via the Uber Eats app¡±.Here¡¯s the full breakdown of the benefits offered by the package:Personal accident during an Uber Eats tripCash benefit for severe sickness or injuryThird party cover during an Uber Eats tripCommenting in a statement,?Filip Nuytemans, Uber Eats general manager for Europe, said:?¡°Uber Eats couriers can now enjoy the freedom and flexibility of working on their own schedule with the peace of mind provided by additional security and protection.¡°This is a reflection of our commitment to invest in solutions that meet the everyday needs and concerns of couriers who want to partner with Uber Eats to earn some extra money.¡±In another supporting statement, Rob Brown, CEO of AXA Corporate Solutions, flagged up what he described as growing complexity in business environments, including ¡°profound changes are brought in by the digital revolution¡±, adding that Axa¡¯s goal is to ¡°support changes by offering appropriate solutions that meet the changing needs of the workforce¡±.At the same time, ¡®insurtech¡¯ startups such as?Zego are spying a similar opportunity. In its case it¡¯s currently providing vehicle insurance cover for gig economy workers on a pay-as-you-go basis. It closed a ?6M Series A in November, led by Balderton.Update:?The Independent Workers of Great Britain union, which has been involved in various gig economy workers rights campaigns in the UK, has now replied to our request for comment on the move by Uber.IWGB couriers and logistics branch secretary Jim Benfield told us: ¡°This move is clearly a reaction to the pressure of organised workers in the so called ¡®gig economy¡¯. But instead of actually respecting the rights these workers have in law, Uber has opted for this PR stunt that will have little to no effect on most workers¡¯ lives. In most cases, workers will not get any sickness cover, as this policy will only pay them if they are hospitalised.¡±¡°The offer to cover hospital costs is also meaningless in the UK, where healthcare is free at the point of use. Furthermore, this health insurance will only cover medical costs when injuries are sustained while doing a delivery and doesn¡¯t cover the endless hours couriers spend logged on to the app desperately waiting for jobs. There is no alternative to worker rights ? and trying to substitute them through third parties with a profit motive is a nightmare waiting to happen.¡±"
116,Apps,"¡°Social media¡± is a clumsy term that entangles enriching social interaction with mindless media consumption. It¡¯s a double-edged sword whose sides aren¡¯t properly distinguished. Taken as a whole, we can¡¯t decide if it ¡°brings the world closer together¡± like Facebook¡¯s new mission statement says, or leaves us depressed and isolated. It does both, but our opportunity and the tech giants¡¯ responsibility is to shift usage toward ¡°time well spent.¡±Thankfully, Facebook¡¯s CEO Mark Zuckerberg seems ready to embrace that responsibility. ¡°Time spent is not a goal by itself. We want the time people spend on Facebook to encourage meaningful social interactions,¡± he said on its most recent earnings call.[Update 12/15/17: Further showing Facebook¡¯s interest, today it published its own ¡°Hard Questions: Is Spending Time on Social Media Bad for Us?¡± blog post with more research to the same conclusion as the science I cite below: it¡¯s passive social media usage that depresses us, so we need to engage.Facebook notes it¡¯s pledged $1 million towards youth technology usage and well-being research. It¡¯s formally launching a Snooze feature we spotted testing in September that lets you hide a person, Page or Group for 30 days if you need some peace. And it announced it will host a summit next year for academics and industry leaders to examine digital distraction, multi-tasking, and focus. But the post only suggests highly indirect ways of addressing mindless consumption, rather than any purposeful interventions.]It¡¯s not just a Facebook issue. Notification-spamming mobile app developers, video platforms like Netflix and YouTube and video games from Candy Crush to Call of Duty need to wake up to how their design choices can squander our attention and stifle our sanity. But Facebook, with its ubiquity, roaring business, idealistic leadership and opportunity to promote what¡¯s positive about technology is uniquely positioned to sound the alarm.To change behavior, we first need to explore the research and measure the difference between connection and distraction.Late at night or lacking energy or losing focus, I and many others often turn to Facebook. Scrolling its endless feed can deliver delightful little doses of dopamine. A photo of a friend or a news link gives us the momentary sensation of accomplishing something, even if it¡¯s just learning some tiny bit of information, no matter how irrelevant. We know we could be getting ready for bed, or contacting someone we care about or getting work done, but nothing¡¯s easier than giving in to craving for another digital content snack.Facebook is the perfect trap for our attention, especially when our will is weak. Algorithmically sorted feeds bring the best content to you with no effort, a simple click lets you dole out a Like and no matter what time of day or how much you browse, there¡¯s always something new. There¡¯s FarmVille and Watch videos and news Trends and Stories to imbibe.Other platforms have different lures. Scanning smartphone alerts saves you from awkward real-life situations, Netflix binges can last days and there¡¯s always another level to beat or opponent to kill in mobile and console games.I know that these extended consumption sessions, particularly on Facebook, don¡¯t leave me feeling good or satisfied. My brain seems jumbled and overcrowded with info. My body seems sapped of strength like I¡¯m in a greasy fast-food coma. And the time I frittered away pools in my stomach as sinking regret about what I could have done. With the average user spending around an hour a day on Facebook¡¯s products, the consequences stack up quickly.But on the other hand, there are the social interactions that remind us why Facebook exists and why we come back so often.You share something that spurs a swath of jokey comment threads with friends or send earnest condolences to a buddy who lost a loved one. You geek out with fellow hobbyists or plan political action in a Facebook Group. You discover an art gallery opening or party down the street and invite pals to join you, or see that an old friend is visiting town and reach out to catch up in person. And through Messenger, you can strike up a convo with someone you can see is online, or laugh about the world in a rollicking group chat.Moments of this nature deepen bonds with your immediate circle, cement you into a larger community, keep old relationships from dying out, foster connections with those aligned by interest or circumstance and trigger real-world meetups. They¡¯re active, participatory and engaging. They aren¡¯t isolating or misanthropic or a waste. They¡¯re truly social, even with a screen in between.These two sets of behaviors deserve distinction. Bad versus good, passive versus active, depleting versus enriching. There are ways to use Facebook and social media and other technologies that ask little of us but take much, and those that require energy and spirit but pay it back with dividends.Scientific research shows just how contrasting their impacts can be. So when we talk about time spent, let¡¯s be sure to differentiate. Otherwise we throw the baby out with the bath water, or let the rotten apples ruin the bunch.For years, Facebook tried to highlight research showing it brought people out of filter bubbles and helped them score jobs.But now Zuckerberg himself is citing studies showing the more mixed impact of Facebook, where the effect depends on how you use it, not just how much. ¡°Research shows that interacting with friends and family on social media tends to be more meaningful and can be good for our well-being, and that¡¯s time well spent. But when we just passively consume content, that may be less true,¡± Zuckerberg said on the Q3 call.He may have been specifically referring to a 2015 study by?Kross and Verduyn that found that experiment participants who used Facebook actively for 10 minutes felt the same or just a little better, but those who used it passively felt worse.A study found people spend more time passively using Facebook than actively using it¡°Our experimental manipulation led people in the passive Facebook usage condition to feel approximately 9% worse at the end of the day compared with baseline. In Study 2, intense passive Facebook usage predicted a 5% decrease in affective well-being over time¡± the study shows. It also worryingly found that people spent significantly more time passively Facebooking.The core driver of this decline in well-being was envy and social comparison. People felt that everyone else¡¯s lives were more entertaining and glamorous than their own, and that everyone else was care-free while they themselves were wracked with stress and trouble. ¡°Continually exposing oneself to positive information about others should elicit envy, an emotion linked to lower well-being,¡± the authors wrote.This was exacerbated by ¡°success theater,¡± a term popularized by The New York Times¡¯ Jenna Wortham to describe how people only show the best side of themselves on social media, and hide all the warts of real life. People essentially perform their life as if it was theater, hoping to make a good impression.Success theater works, on social media or otherwise. A 2011 study by Jordan et al. found that ¡°people may think they are more alone in their emotional difficulties than they really are.¡± That¡¯s because people underestimated negative emotions and overestimated positive emotions in their peers.A study in 2013 by Krasnova et al. found that 20 percent of envy-inducing situations that experiment participants experienced were on Facebook, and that ¡°intensity of passive following is likely to reduce users¡¯ life satisfaction in the long-run, as it triggers upward social comparison and invidious emotions.¡±Passive Facebook usage leads to envy, which leads to declines in life satisfactionFacebook users can even exhibit a ¡°self-promotion ? envy spiral¡± where they increasingly adopt narcissistic behaviors and glorify their lives in an attempt to compete with the rest of their social graph.?A longitudinal study by Shakya and Christakis in 2017 with a larger subject base than many other Facebook well-being studies found that lots of Liking and link clicking led to declines in people¡¯s mental health.Yet when studies looked at active Facebook behavior, they found some indication of positive repercussions, as Jon Brooks discovered in a look across Facebook well-being research for NPR.A 2012 paper by Deters et al. found that experimentally inducing increased status updating ¡°reduced loneliness . . . due to participants feeling more connected to their friends on a daily basis.¡± Wise et al. found in 2010 that directly communicating with friends on Facebook led to participants reporting pleasant emotions, but not when passively skimming through the site.And to get down to the nitty-gritty, Kraut et al. reported in 2015 that ¡°Receiving targeted, composed communication from strong ties was associated with improvements in well-being while viewing friends¡¯ wide-audience broadcasts and receiving one-click feedback were not.¡± Essentially, active commenting by friends boosted people¡¯s emotions while Liking didn¡¯t.The scientists aren¡¯t the only ones convinced Facebook can have a negative influence on our lives. Former employees and industry pundits are speaking up, too.We¡¯ve reached the dawn of an era of reckoning with the unintended consequences of technology. The fake news scandals and Russian interference surrounding the 2016 U.S. presidential election have landed Facebook, along with Twitter and Google, in the hotseats of congressional hearings. If ever there was a time for Facebook to look closer at what it really is and what its impact can be, it¡¯s now. That means improving election security, fighting harassment, weeding out disinformation, but also reconsidering its design ethics.Facebook¡¯s general counsel Colin Stretch gets grilled by Congress over Russian interference into the presidential election via FacebookEx-Facebookers aren¡¯t shy to voice their views.¡°The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops we¡¯ve created are destroying how society works,¡± said former Facebook VP of user growth Chamath Palihapitiya. Hired in 2007 to help Facebook conquer the world, the founding partner of VC fund Social Capital seems to have had his conscience catch up with him. ¡°I think we have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works,¡± he says, asking leaders of the world not to feed the beast of optimizing engagement while forbidding his children from using these kinds of products.NEW YORK, NY ? APRIL 29: Chamath Palihapitiya of Social+Capital Partnership speaks onstage at the TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2013 at The Manhattan Center on April 29, 2013 in New York City. (Photo by Brian Ach/Getty Images for TechCrunch)[Update 12/15/17: Palihapitya softened his comments in a follow-up Facebook post noting that ¡°For all the ensuing controversy, I genuinely believe that Facebook is a force for good in the world¡± before saying ¡°the important thing is what we as an industry do now to ensure that our impact on society continues to be a positive one. Facebook has made tremendous strides in coming to terms with its unforeseen influence and, more so than any of its peers, the team there has taken real steps to course correct.¡±]Facebook¡¯s first president, Sean Parker,?recalls that ¡°The thought process that went into building these applications, Facebook being the first of them, . . . was all about: ¡®How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?¡¯ ¡± Now he says ¡°I don¡¯t know if I really understood the consequences . . .?It probably interferes with productivity in weird ways. God only knows what it¡¯s doing to our children¡¯s brains.¡± It¡¯s telling that public figures with their social and financial standing wrapped up in Facebook are willing to criticize it so publicly.¡°One reason I think it is particularly important for us to talk about this now is that we may be the last generation that can remember life before¡± former Facebook product manager and Like button co-creator Justin Rosenstein told The Guardian. [Disclosure: Rosenstein is a friend of mine]Now the co-founder of productivity startup Asana, Rosenstein wrote on his Facebook that while he¡¯s grateful to have worked there and thinks it can foster compassion, ¡°We technologists can take responsibility for mindfully designing tools that help users align their attention with their intention.¡± Denoting the dualism of social media usage, he says that ¡°When we do, technology is a powerful tool for helping us collaborate toward our highest goals; when we don¡¯t, we relinquish control of ourselves, and potentially our democracies,¡± and calls distractedness a?¡°bug in our collective programming.¡±Sean ParkerEven Snapchat has recognized the danger of intermingling social and media evident in Facebook¡¯s News Feed. Its latest update separates friends from professional content publishers to create a more overtly interactive wing of its app.Perhaps the most vocal critic of exploitative apps is Tristan Harris, the former Google ethicist who has created a movement around the concept of ¡°Time Well Spent.¡± That includes designing ¡°Do Not Disturb¡± technology for rejecting notifications and staying cognizant of your social media behavior.¡°This issue of what Facebook should do is not just about whether or not Facebook causes people to regret the time they spent, or that people are unhappy about spending a certain amount of time on social media, or that it¡¯s about distraction. None of those thing are what Time Well Spent is really about,¡± Harris says. ¡°The thing that¡¯s so disconcerting right now is that the attention extraction business model means that loneliness, because of the amount of time people spend looking at screens, is good for business.¡±Tristan Harris, leader of the Time Well Spent movementThe time for change is now because things are poised to get worse.We¡¯re shifting from text-based communication to visual communication with Facebook¡¯s adoption of the Snapchat Stories format across its apps. While Stories were designed to let you be raw and unpolished, beyond the highlights you post to the permanent Instagram feed, they¡¯ve just made signalling your status and inducing envy a more constant game.Augmented reality and especially virtual reality have the potential to inject technology between us and the world around us. It will be even easier to get lost in these technologies, abandoning real life for a virtual one, or use them as substitutes for human interaction, querying an eye-piece for directions or recommendations instead of asking a local.And most importantly, the approach of global smartphone saturation gives everyone and endless distraction at all times. A damning Atlantic article blames smartphones for teens sleeping less, getting their driver licenses later and even delaying sex. Our brains just didn¡¯t evolve to resist a glowing, moving screen full of random facts and bottomless entertainment. Everyone deserves the occasional moment to turn off their minds, indulge in some guilty-pleasure entertainment and enjoy the new opiate of the masses: our phones. But without mindfulness about when we¡¯ve had enough, indulgence spills into addiction.The fracturing of attention is the crisis of this generation, and we need action. But attention is the center of a new tragedy of the commons. There¡¯s always someone else willing to exploit it, leading us down dark and endless paths of passive consumption. That¡¯s why Facebook, as the biggest player in the attention economy, must step up.I¡¯ve questioned Facebook and its VR division Oculus for years about research into well-being and internet addiction. It never had much to share, or even gave indications that it was taking the issue seriously.For better and worse, the company is populated by optimists who are skilled at seeing the best-case scenarios, but sometimes miss the worst. That¡¯s led it to be caught off-guard by privacy mishaps, balancing censorship and safety and thwarting abuse. Despite its massive reach and power, the company wasn¡¯t prepared for concerted disinformation campaigns by Russian election meddlers.I worried it would take a mental health tragedy for Facebook to get serious about investigating the sources of negative emotions stemming from its service and building improvements into the product. But recently, Facebook put me in touch with?David Ginsberg, director of research for?Facebook, who¡¯s been working to ramp up Facebook¡¯s response to the threat of passive misuse.¡°The technology industry is grappling with fundamental questions about well-being and the role technology plays in people¡¯s lives,¡± Ginsberg tells me. ¡°We want?Facebook?to be a place that contributes to your life in a positive way. We realize we don¡¯t have all the answers, but we¡¯re investing in research, people and product development to help get it right.¡±Here¡¯s a video with a deeper look at Ginsberg¡¯s team:It¡¯s also confidence-inducing to hear Zuckerberg say that he¡¯s more than willing to put user well-being ahead of Facebook¡¯s business priorities. ¡°Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits,¡± he said on the Q3 call. ¡°It¡¯s important to remember that Facebook is about bringing people closer together and enabling meaningful social interactions; it¡¯s not primarily about consuming content passively.¡±Facebook has already begun to realign its product around bringing the world closer together, and that includes many features to stoke active participation.Groups were a huge area of development for Facebook this year, with it organizing a whole summit for Group admins where it launched new features for discovering, moderating and analyzing these niche forums. While the News Feed can feel like a circus dominated by one-way broadcasts about surface-level themes and daily ephemera, Groups are more like a caf? where deeper discussion on esoteric topics can thrive.Facebook reordered the News Feed to put ¡°friends first,¡± preferencing original content sharing that can spark personal interaction over copy-and-pasting articles. There¡¯s now a purposeful way to solicit recommendations with a status update, which often lead to vibrant comment sections of people sharing their favorite places. Those comment reels can morph into chat-like threads on desktop that stay with you for swifter replies as you browse the site. In fact, the whole design of comment threads has been refreshed to look more like chat bubbles to catalyze more back-and-forth.Facebook last year launched a standalone Events app to help people find what¡¯s going on offline and attend with friends. Now it¡¯s rebranded it as Facebook Local with the inclusion of restaurants and landmarks with reviews from friends in hopes of helping you leverage your community to get the most out of your city. Just today, Facebook was spotted expanding tests of an offline Meetup planning feature for Groups.Perhaps most importantly for encouraging healthy usage, Facebook Messenger now shows who¡¯s active atop the home screen to stimulate conversations. It¡¯s been aggressively pushing video chat, which saw twice as many sessions in 2017 as 2016. New features for sharing location, making plans and even playing multiplayer games like Words with Friends discourage users from zoning out. Instagram, too, has been pushing more active communication through enhancements to direct messaging and a whole standalone app for the feature.Facebook is also adapting to its responsibility for the welfare of its users. Though controversial, it¡¯s rolling out proactive detection artificial intelligence to find users showing signals of potential self harm or suicide and notify friends or first-responders before their content is even reported. And the Community Help product makes volunteering viral, so neighbors can offer or seek assistance after natural disasters or other crises.Zuckerberg¡¯s stated approach to boosting Time Well Spent is far from game-changing. ¡°When done well, video brings us closer together,¡± he said on the Q3 call. Some will say it merely furthers Facebook¡¯s business goals of driving more lucrative video ad views, but it¡¯s also pragmatic. If video is the easiest way to waste time on Facebook, and people already spend hours a day on completely asocial television, a little effort could go a long way.¡°We¡¯ve found that communities formed around video like TV shows or sports create a greater sense of belonging than many other kinds of communities . . . But too often right now, watching video is just a passive consumption experience,¡± Zuckerberg says. ¡°So we¡¯re going to focus our products on all the ways to build community around the video that people share and watch. That¡¯s something Facebook can uniquely do.¡±How that will happen isn¡¯t exactly clear, but I have some ideas. Rather than funding one-off News Feed videos or asocial original programming, Facebook could funnel money toward content creators who make Shows with mystery or subjective narratives that will develop surrounding communities the way Lost did. Facebook could also expand its new Creator app for video makers to let them start in-app fan clubs where their top followers can forge connections and cheer their favorite influencers on together.Still, these approaches are all indirect. Facebook has a chance to address the problem head on by communicating with users it thinks are stuck in a rut.In my least-healthy Facebook behavior pattern, I¡¯ll browse for a half or whole hour, make a quick loop past Twitter and email, and then go right back to Facebook¡¯s News Feed. I¡¯ve even caught myself reloading Facebook while still on Facebook, or closing the app on my phone and staring at the home screen like a zombie before reopening Facebook again. There¡¯s more Facebook could do to shake me out of these cycles.Facebook should be able to learn through quantitative and qualitative research that this doesn¡¯t make me feel good. The same goes for long sessions of lurking without commenting or interacting much. A big step forward for Ginsberg and Facebook¡¯s research team would be figuring out how to measure passive use, and identify flags that indicate I could use some intervention.What if when Facebook saw you mindlessly scrolling, it showed a big box in the News Feed suggesting you message your closest friends who are currently online? Or it purposefully started surfacing active comment threads you could jump into, gave a prompt for something to share or even offered a reminder of how much time you¡¯d spent browsing today?If Facebook is willing to make this commitment to user well-being, not in words but in product changes, it could start an industry-wide trend. Users could grow to expect their apps to look out for their well-being rather than exploit their attention. Eventually, tech companies that unabashedly abuse their users could lose them.That¡¯s all just a dream for now, though. The most we might expect is for Ginsberg¡¯s team to get more funding, more clout, more buy-in from Facebook¡¯s various teams, and more of a mandate to incite change. The solutions Facebook proposes might at best chip away at the problem rather than tackle it in earnest.Unfortunately, Facebook¡¯s business model is directly tied to attention. The more time spent, well or not, the more ad views it racks up and the more money it makes. While this model lets Facebook offer itself to users for free, including those who could never afford a subscription fee, it strongly disincentivizes any large scale changes that would dramatically reduce average usage time, even if it boosted satisfaction. ¡°We have to decouple attention from profit¡± Harris protests, but that¡¯s a much bigger task than adding a few benevolent pixels.And so it is likely us who must rescue our attention and bend our behavior back toward what makes us feel good long-term. That means commenting something personal rather than just Liking, messaging friends rather than spying on their profiles and being vulnerable in what we share.We don¡¯t have to pretend life is perfect, especially to the detriment of our friends. The occasional crack in the veneer can help people see what¡¯s real about us. It will take courage to own our flaws, open up about what¡¯s hurting, and admit when we need help. And it will take effort to cast off the idle inertia and fear of awkwardness that keeps us from communicating.We¡¯re fated to spend more and more time interacting through technology. It¡¯s our choice whether we spend it purposefully."
117,Apps,"As of this morning, Apple Maps has expanded to include indoor layouts of 30 airports across the globe. The company has primarily hit American cities thus far, covering what looks to be most of the big cities across the contiguous U.S. There are some key international airports, as well, including Hong Kong International, Amsterdam, Geneva, two in London and Berlin and a handful of Canadian locations. It¡¯s a big roll out, all in one fell swoop, that appears to have taken quite some time in the making. Each location requires close cooperation with airlines and the airports themselves, along with in-person surveyors. People have been recording the data in-person ? sort of a human stand-in for those street mapping cars that Apple and Google deploy to get a lay of the land. If an airport is included in the list, it will now sport the words ¡°Look Inside¡± on the map. Tapping that will pop up a bird¡¯s-eye view layout of the inside of the terminal. It¡¯s that standard mapping grid view ? in spite of sending human surveyors to collect data, there¡¯s nothing here akin to Satellite or Street View. Not that most airport terminals are really all that much to look at in the first place.The grid view highlights each gate in yellow, with a few key destinations populating the map ? things like check-ins, baggage and airport lounges. Drilling down from there reveals other spots in more detail, including restaurants, restrooms and the like. Tap on a restaurant, for instance, and you¡¯ll get a tab with data just like you would outside the airport. It offers the terminal name and floor number, phone number, hours and reviews pulled from a third-party review platform like Yelp. Tapping on the number in the upper-right corner toggles between terminal levels. Swiping up with two fingers, meanwhile, offers up a 3D view of the space, with added depth. This lay of the land was gathered using CAD files provided to Apple by the individual airports, to give the user a better sense of place while wandering around the terminal. We had the opportunity to test the new feature at JFK¡¯s Terminal 5 earlier today, which was like going through all of the travel rigmarole without actually getting to go anywhere. I will say, however, that I was pleasantly surprised at how good a job the system does triangulating a phone indoors. The location accuracy is within a couple of meters, which is impressive inside, where GPS data is a crapshoot, at best. Apple accomplishes this by using Wi-Fi points throughout the terminal. That triangulation is equally accurate whether or not you¡¯re on the Wi-Fi ??which I suspect many travelers aren¡¯t, given the number of airports that still charge for access.It should prove a handy feature for those planning out an hour or two in the airport ? time I tend to spend wandering down terminal halls in search of slightly less terrible food options. There¡¯s still a lot of room for potential growth here, too. After all, Apple has started incorporating flight data into other pieces of iOS, so this would be a no-brainer.Being able to see which gate a flight is leaving from directly inside the map app could be supremely useful. Ditto for figuring out which carousel your luggage is on. No word on when that information is coming ? that after all, is a pretty unwieldy additional stream of data layer to add in. Meantime, you can find the full list of participating airports on Apple¡¯s site.?"

The app, which is initially available on Android with iOS arriving soon, was first introduced into beta testing this fall, with a focus on improvements to its overall user experience, content discovery, performance and personalization features.For example, the beta build introduced a redesigned ¡°Trending¡± section that cycles through the featured broadcasts at the top, a better filtering tool to help you find interactive and co-streaming broadcasts, and a new ¡°Following¡± section for tracking favorite broadcasters. This tab will feature broadcasters who are live along with other recommended streams.Meanwhile, users profile pages have been updated with links to their channel, level and ¡°sparks.¡±Microsoft also said that the app¡¯s code base had been improved to boost performance and stability.Since the beta test, a few things have been added ahead of today¡¯s public launch, Microsoft tells us For example, the app can send out push notifications that alert you to when favorite streamers are on, and you can now tap and hold on the homepage to see video previews.The search algorithms have been enhanced, too, to boost content discovery, says Microsoft.Viewers can also customize Mixer by making adjustments to Settings like stream video quality, chat and audio toggles, and sharing options.Chat has gotten an upgrade as well, as it includes a viewer list, whispers, and basic mod features.The launch comes at a time when Microsoft is trying to gain ground in mobile gameplay streaming, in a market where Amazon-owned Twitch has been dominating.Though Mixer offers similar features to Twitch and YouTube Gaming ? like emotes, subscriptions and live broadcasts ? Twitch has more concurrent streamers and viewers, according to third-party reports, with YouTube in second place.

Facebook is embracing pre-rolls after years of shunning them as it tries to make payouts to video creators sustainable. Facebook¡¯s head of video Fidji Simo tells TechCrunch that it will not renew direct subsidies to Live News Feed video broadcasters, confirming a Digiday report about it halting payments that included $50 million in contracts for 140 publishers and celebrities.¡°A?lot of the deals ¡¦ were always meant to be temporary,¡± says Simo. ¡°We have been funding content for a while. We thought we¡¯d launch a new type of format, and we tried to help publishers learn how to make that content work.¡± Facebook has a new set of deals to pay upfront for Watch shows, and that includes some recurring Live shows. But when asked if Live payments that funded content like BuzzFeed¡¯s watermelon rubber band broadcast would be allowed to run out by early next year and not be renewed, Simo said ¡°yes.¡±Instead, Facebook will encourage Live News Feed video broadcasters to use branded content sponsorships and mid-roll ads. But videos must now be at least three minutes long to qualify and put the ad break at least one minute in, as opposed to the old rules that required videos to be at least 90 seconds with the mid-roll at least 20 seconds in.On a more positive note, Facebook will be upranking the News Feed presence of Watch original video shows that get consistent viewership, and it will display Shows in News Feed to users who follow the Show¡¯s creator¡¯s Page even if they haven¡¯t viewed or subscribed to the Show itself yet. That could help Facebook develop a few flagship Shows, as nothing has quite broken out of the crowd of low quality, often unscripted content in Watch. Facebook has said it plans to fund fewer Shows with bigger budgets in the future.Facebook is trying to balance the delicate relationship between users, content publishers, advertisers and itself. The addition of pre-roll ads should delight publishers who want to ensure they get paid for their content even if users bail after a minute. It gives advertisers more flexibility, and could earn Facebook a boatload of money if Watch shows become popular.For the user, pre-roll ads will surely be annoying, but if someone purposefully goes to the Watch tab to view a specific video series, having to endure an ad feels pretty standard. Facebook would be smart to keep pre-rolls out of the News Feed where people serendipitously discover videos, but where having to view an ad first would ruin the breezy scrolling experience.The big losers here, though, are the publishers who took Facebook¡¯s Live and on-demand News Feed video subsidies, built up big teams of staffers to produce the expensive content and are now being shooed toward other monetization options that might not be mature enough to pay the bills. Before, these publishers just had to make entertaining video, and Facebook paid. Now, those videos must jam in sponsored content, or hold people¡¯s attention for at least a minute before they can show an ad break. We could see video staff layoffs at publishers as a result.It¡¯s a symptom of a larger news industry crisis, where publishers struggling to compensate for dropping display ad rates a few years ago were eager to suckle on added referral traffic from Facebook¡¯s News Feed. But as I¡¯ve written, publishers have become dumb content in Facebook¡¯s smart pipes, reduced to ghostwriters Facebook can easily swap out. Publishers should have been concentrating on building an owned audience on their sites and email lists instead of becoming dependent on Facebook¡¯s fickle mediated channel.Now Facebook is changing its video strategy from subsidizing News Feed videos more fit for journalism to longer, dramatic Watch Videos, while promoting more user-generated content from friends instead of articles from news outlets. Without the same massive team and profits, publishers may not be agile enough to gracefully adjust. And that¡¯s why when Facebook dangles its next gift of virality, publishers should stay skeptical and focus on their long-term strategy rather than jumping through the new hoop.For more on this problem, check out my rant video below:"

122,Apps,"Snapchat is finally opening up so outside developers can help it offer infinite augmented reality experiences beyond those it designs in-house. Today,?Snap launches the Lens Studio AR developer tool for desktops so anyone can create World Lenses that place interactive, imaginary 3D objects in your photos and videos.But brands, news publishers and developers will have to promote their own Lenses by marketing their QR Snapcodes that users scan to unlock an AR effect for 24 hours. That¡¯s because Snapchat won¡¯t display these Community Lenses in its camera unless businesses pay a partnered creative agency to build them a special effect and then buy Sponsored Lens ads from Snap.The launch could vastly broaden Snapchat¡¯s AR entertainment value, helping it to compete with Facebook¡¯s own Camera Effects AR platform that launched to all developers early this week. Though for now the platform only lets you make World Lenses and not selfie masks, more AR toys will give Snapchat a much-needed boost to sharing and viewing at a time when user growth has slowed to a trickle in the face of Instagram¡¯s competition.Snap already sees one-third of its 178 million daily users play with Lenses each day for an average of 3 minutes, which adds up to 500 years of playtime with AR each day. And that¡¯s just with the 3,000 Lenses Snap has made itself. With the opening of the platform,?Snap¡¯s VP of engineering and camera platform leader Eitan?Pilipski tells me, ¡°There¡¯s something magical about coming back every day and finding that there¡¯s a new experience.¡±By removing its in-house AR design team as a bottleneck through agency partnerships, Snap could scale up augmented reality advertising so it doesn¡¯t miss its quarterly revenue target again.The launch is a wise move. Back in April I wrote that ¡°Snap¡¯s anti-developer attitude is an augmented liability,¡± discussing how filling the real world with AR was too tall of a task for Snap to tackle on its own. It needed an army of outside developers to assist it, and now it¡¯s recruiting that army. The question is whether developers see the audience scale in Snapchat necessary to validate investing time into the platform, and whether Snap provides enough unpaid access to that audience. Because to move the needle on growth, Snapchat needs the AR brainchildren of more than just slimy marketers slapping brands atop the virtual world.Starting today, anyone can download the Lens Studio desktop app for Mac or Windows in English and visit its website for examples and documentation. Lens Studio is a slightly stripped down version of what Snap¡¯s own team uses to build AR experiences. It¡¯s designed for simplicity, so anyone from 2D Photoshop newbies to experienced 3D animators and coders can jump into making basic image overlays or reactive AR characters. Developers retain ownership of Lenses they create, though grant Snapchat the right to use them.Developers can build static or animated objects, 2D cutouts, windows into other worlds, floating picture frames and even 3D objects that react when you tap, look at or approach them. Developers can get a temporary Snapcode to test their creation on their phones. After going through a quick moderation process to make sure the Lens isn¡¯t objectionable, developers get a? Snapcode that¡¯s valid for a year, which they can share via social media, their websites, print materials or however they want to get the word out.Snapchat¡¯s moderators will enforce rules stating that Lenses can¡¯t depict violence, weapons, nudity, sex acts, profanity, hatred, stereotypes, illegal activity, hashtags, usernames, threats, bullying or encourage Snapping while driving. Snapchat tells me it will have a report button for users who need to flag Lenses as problematic, and a human moderation team will monitor reports and deactivate offending Lenses. It will have to keep a watchful eye, though, as the vividness of AR could make for a big PR scandal if kids start playing with something graphic.Snapchat also plans to offer Lens Studio Challenges, where it will provide an unspecified reward for developers who create Lenses that match a proposed theme or use case. They might just get recognition on the new Lens Studio website, but if Snapchat is smart, it will actually release the winners in its app to drive developer interest in the platform.While users can still find the curated assortment of Lenses within the Snapchat camera, they¡¯ll now be able to discover Community Lenses elsewhere. By tapping and holding on a Lens Snapcode in view of their camera or uploading a screenshot, they¡¯ll get a thumbnail preview of what the Lens does and the option to unlock it. They¡¯ll then see the Lens in their carousel in the camera for 24 hours. Tapping a little ¡°i¡± information button reveals who made the Lens, and users can send one to a friend via private chat so Lenses can go viral.The 24-hour limit could prove annoying as users might not want to go through the chore of rescanning codes every day. On the other hand, it could discourage overuse of a specific lens, preventing burnout amongst a creator¡¯s friends and viewers.?Pilipski says Snapchat will be listening to the community to evolve the experience. But one advantage is that developers can update a code to provide a different Lens so they could incrementally evolve it over time or provide different experiences without having to promote a different code.Overall, the initial crop of AR experiences look cute and on-brand for Snapchat¡¯s goofy style. We¡¯ll see if the dancing hot dog that was viewed 1.5 billion times was a blockbuster because of the novelty of AR, or whether users will enduringly want to play with 3D characters.Snapchat has partnered with seven Lens Studio firms to outsource creation of its AR experiences.?Avatar Labs, Fisherman Labs, Haus, Media Monks, North Kingdom, Trigger Global and Vidmob can be paid to create a Lens in just a few days instead of the weeks it used to take Snapchat¡¯s internal team, which also required a $300,000 minimum ad spend. Now brands can buy CPM distribution of their Snapchat Lens in the camera app¡¯s carousel for an $8 to $20 CPM.Snapchat¡¯s in-house design team will still work with advertisers, but will focus on super premium campaigns using the most cutting edge technology options that go beyond Lens Studio¡¯s capabilities.Snapchat has been a closed company since its inception, relying on the instincts and curation of CEO Evan Spiegel. But here, Snapchat is changing its strategy to embrace what it can¡¯t entirely control. That unpredictability may be the key to keeping the app fresh. As much as Snapchat is the arbiter of cool from its Venice Beach offices in LA, it can¡¯t foresee every weird teen trend or toy, let alone build them itself.By opening the platform, Snap can let the community do the trial-and-error for it. Snapchat should both learn from what Community Lenses prove popular and build more like them, but also promote those that are a hit rather than forcing developers to grow an audience on their own. It¡¯s the promise of potential virality that turned Facebook into a platform powerhouse 10 years ago, spawning giants like Zynga. Now Snapchat¡¯s path forward depends on it being willing to share its users and the credit for entertaining them."

It¡¯s filling its home page with personalized playlists and best of collections from top genres rather than other content like it¡¯s feed. The hope is to make SoundCloud instantly accessible to new users and a more reliable place to discover fresh songs for long-time loyalists.In my recent deep-dive into SoundCloud¡¯s strategy, I outlined its need to differentiate itself from Spotify by focusing on its $5 tier of ad-free access to independent music, legally grey remixes and DJ sets you can¡¯t find elsewhere, and helping artists earn money beyond royalties through commerce. In line with that strategy, today¡¯s redesign lets SoundCloud highlight the best of its unique archive of user uploaded songs.SoundCloud¡¯s new CEO Kerry Trainor tells me ¡°The new SoundCloud home is a more curated, personalized way to discover amazing creators first?years ahead of the mainstream charts¡±.Read TechCrunch¡¯s feature piece ¡°To fix SoundCloud, it must become the anti-Spotify¡°Listeners will now be greeted by featured playlists including Hip Hop Supreme and DJ mixset-focused In The Mix, the Spotify Discover Weekly-esque personalized tracklist The Upload, and algorithmically generated More Of What You Like and Artists You Should Know.

Yesterday I opened SoundCloud to see two big ads filling my screen.With funding and a leaner operation giving SoundCloud some runway after years of sluggish performance, it¡¯s up to Trainor to give SoundCloud some momentum. Interface changes are an easy way to start, though a deeper repositioning of SoundCloud around indie creators that its competitors lack will be important.¡°What differentiates SoundCloud is our catalog of over 170 million tracks, and new home lets us elevate and celebrate the incredible talent that drives the SoundCloud experience¡± says Trainor.

124,Apps,"Match Group, which houses a large portfolio of dating app brands ? including most notably, Tinder, Match, and OKCupid ? is prepping a notable upgrade to one of its older brands: Plenty of Fish. The dating service, often dubbed ¡®POF¡¯ by its users, was founded in 2003 then sold to Match Group in 2015 for $575 million. But it has since remained fairly quiet, in terms of the state of its business, and has been slow to roll out upgrades even as Tinder soared.That¡¯s now changing, the company says. For starters, POF is gearing up to launch a collection of new features designed to bring its app into the more modern age of dating. The launch follows a significant revamp of the app¡¯s user interface this summer, which will soon extend to the web.This new group of features, which POF is calling ¡°Conversation Powers,¡± includes the addition of voice messaging, video calling, and the ability to share photos in chats. In the near future, it will also include the ability to share GIFs in your conversations and add illustrations to photos, like doodles and stickers.What¡¯s interesting about the way these features are launching is that they¡¯re not just switched on whenever you¡¯ve matched with someone. Instead, POF will trigger your ¡°Conversation Powers¡± after you¡¯ve chatted with a match for a period of time.These sorts of voice and messaging features are common today on social media and chat applications, but haven¡¯t all made their way to the world of dating apps.¡°When it comes to the conversation experience, dating apps haven¡¯t traditionally focused on it. There¡¯s a lot of attention and R&D on matching with someone and swiping and all that,¡± says CEO Hesam Hosseini, who joined the company from Match Group, post-acquisition. ¡°But when it comes to actually being in a conversation, dating apps are several years behind social apps. Plenty of Fish is poised to lead the charge on that,¡± he adds.Of course, some dating apps have added GIFs, emojis, photo sharing and other features, but even Match Group¡¯s lead app, Tinder, doesn¡¯t have a full lineup.It¡¯s interesting, then, that POF would get all these features first ? especially because its demographic skews older. (POF users tend to be in the 30 to 40 age range, notes?Hosseini.)That being said,?Hosseini believes features like this are becoming common.¡°As platforms like Facebook adopt them, they¡¯re going to become features you expect,¡± he says. ¡°They¡¯re on their way to becoming more mainstream.¡±?Beyond simply updating the functionality and user experience to stay current and on-trend, the new additions are also meant to offer POF users ways to better personalize their interactions and connect.Some dating app users ? particularly older ones ? prefer voice over texting; they¡¯re often asking to hop on a call with a match ahead of scheduling a meetup. But not everyone wants to share their phone number with a stranger, which is where the voice calling option comes in.Instead of dialing a phone number, matches can call each other in the app. Or for a middle-of-the-road approach between texting and calls, they could use the voice messaging feature instead.The bigger picture is that POF aims to differentiate itself from Tinder and others going forward by doubling down on conversations ? something that¡¯s already a key focus for the company.The app is the second largest U.S. dating app in Match¡¯s portfolio, the company claims, with 150 million registered users worldwide. It¡¯s also the second largest in terms of monthly users, behind Tinder. (POF doesn¡¯t share active users, however). And it claims to have the most conversations compared with other dating apps, with 2.5 million taking place on its platform daily.The company also says it was seeing $80 million in revenue at the time of its acquisition, and has been growing that in the double-digits since.GIFs and illustrations aren¡¯t being rolled out until 2018, but messaging, calling and photo sharing features are arriving today on iOS and Android. They will be also be available on the mobile web and desktop later this year.The launch of the new features follows a couple of other recent updates for POF, including last summer¡¯s launch of a conversation-starting utility called Spark, which lets you comment on an individual part of a user¡¯s profile (like Hinge). It also just integrated with Google Home.Despite these changes, POF along with other older apps are still challenged in terms of overcoming users¡¯ preconceptions. If people remember it as a dated app with an older crowd, they may never bother with it again, gravitating to newer apps like Tinder, Bumble, or Hinge, for example.That said, many people understand that dating is a numbers game ? meaning, the more places you play, the more people you meet, and the more shots you have at ditching the apps for good."
125,Apps,"Has Amazon¡¯s ¡®one-click¡¯ checkout on mobile looked a little different to you lately? A number of users of Amazon¡¯s mobile applications have recently reported seeing a new checkout option that replaces the click ? well, on mobile, the tap ? with a swipe instead. As it turns out, the option is part of a fairly large-scale test Amazon has underway. Currently, around half of U.S. iOS and Android customers are seeing the new feature.If you¡¯re in the test group, you¡¯ll notice that the one-click ordering process you¡¯re used to has been updated with a new, orange button that reads ¡°Swipe to buy with 1-Click.¡± That means, instead of tapping on the button to make the purchase using the shipping and payment information already on file, you slide your finger across the button instead.The feature is reminiscent of the way we used to unlock an iPhone, before advancements like Touch ID and Face ID made the process simpler. But it¡¯s also a slightly slower way to checkout, compared to tapping.That said, it seems that a number of customers prefer the swiping gesture as it¡¯s more intentional, and less prone to the accidental click. If you¡¯ve ever been moving through Amazon¡¯s app a bit too quickly, you may have inadvertently tapped the 1-Click button. It was almost too easy!We¡¯ve seen tests similar to this in the past. For example, last year, some users reported a ¡°swipe to place your order¡± feature on Amazon¡¯s app:I've never seen this before in the Amazon iOS app: 'swipe to place your order' pic.twitter.com/OtcstwZUHl?

Smart. pic.twitter.com/ogD6RjZA3J? Patrick Keane (@phkeane) June 7, 2016We understand that the two tests are unrelated, however. The 2016 test was focused on Amazon¡¯s two-click ¡°Buy Now¡± checkout experience. In this case, the user would tap a Buy Now button then slide to complete the checkout on the following screen. That feature launched in early last year then rolled out worldwide this summer through early fall.Now, the same sort of slide-to-checkout option is coming to 1-Click. (Remember, of course, you have to actually enable 1-Click on your account to see this feature in action.)The decision to test sliding to check out?is not related to the?to the expiration of Amazon¡¯s 1-click patent, we also understand, but is instead a direct response to positive customer feedback about the Buy Now slide-to-checkout launch.While the feature may seem minor in the grand scheme of things, Amazon leads the market when it comes to the development of new ways for people to shop ? whether that¡¯s Dash buttons or voice orders of even just the 1-Click itself.Reached for comment, an Amazon spokesperson declined to offer details about how long the new test has been underway. Nor would they say if or when the 1-Click ¡°slide¡± would launch to the public.¡°We are constantly innovating on behalf of our customers,¡± the spokesperson said. ¡°With their feedback in mind, we keep what works and discontinue what doesn¡¯t.¡±"

127,Apps,"We all love to share GIFs ? and there are plenty of ways to do that, through online portals or keyboards ? but often times because there is so much content, you¡¯ll end up surfacing up a lower-fidelity GIF.There can be plenty of copies of the same video clips as a GIF, or maybe it¡¯s just difficult to capture and upload, but Gfycat hopes that it can be solved at a technical level. Gfycat is now making a big push on the technical front to make those GIFs look better and more discoverable as creators look to continue to upload content, regardless of what kind of quality or fidelity they are. And it¡¯s more of a video problem than an image recognition problem, CEO Richard Rabbat said.¡°We have scaled [through] creators?through word of mouth, and they are just getting excited about Gfycat and [creating] content,¡± Rabbat said. ¡°In many cases, what we¡¯re building from an AI and machine learning perspective are additional tools to support their excitement. We want to enable them to drive more virality for their content, and in this case, make their content even more easily discoverable. That¡¯s something that¡¯s very important to us as we keep focusing on the creators.¡±Rabbat said Gfycat will scour the web for the original version of a video where the GIF is coming from ? in some cases it comes from YouTube ? and analyze that video to figure out what part of it the GIF came from. The company then produces a higher-quality GIF and swaps it out, making the broader spread of the GIF a higher-quality version. The company creates a kind of model for each frame in the GIF and then tries to match that up with the higher-quality videos, he said.¡°What we noticed was a number of users that were uploading GIFs were incredibly popular, but when they uploaded most of the time they were really low quality,¡± Rabbat said. ¡°We¡¯ve been looking at AI and machine learning for a while now, as it relates [to] our initiative to beautify the web when it comes to GIFs.¡±After that, if a creator uploads a GIF that includes a celebrity, they might not tag that as having that celebrity. So the company has done some internal analysis to identify which celebrity is in that GIF and automatically tag them. The hope is that while the company has a library of existing popular celebrities, it¡¯ll be able to identify up-and-coming celebrities with these tools and automatically start tagging them as they come in.Rabbat said Gfycat built both of these tools internally?because the off-the-shelf products that were available didn¡¯t work well with GIFs. Though GIFs are, of course, a series of images, he said often times a lot of different elements (like multiple celebrities) will appear in sequence while standard image recognition technology might only identify one or two of them. The technology is instead based on a video, he said.¡°One of the big challenges is the raw amount of information a GIF includes,¡± Rabbat said. ¡°It¡¯s hundreds of frames, sometimes more. We need to identify at a very high rate these different celebrities that are being created. We wanted to do it in real time. We were able to do it within a minute of people creating content, we were able to identify the celebrity.¡±Finally, with all these tools, Gfycat wants to identify text within various captions in GIFs as they come in. Again, part of the challenge here was that a GIF might come in with a caption, but the text is grainy and not easily read or identifiable. Gfycat sought to build some internal tools that help understand what the captions say and then make the GIFs more discoverable based on those captions.While Gfycat is definitely not alone in attempts to make short-form video content like GIFs more easily discoverable ? there are companies like Tenor and Giphy looking to create robust platforms as well ? it¡¯s attempting to treat the problem with technical tools. And with more than 130 million monthly active users (Giphy, in comparison, has 300 million daily active users), it¡¯s going to become a technical problem as this kind of content can¡¯t be curated at scale."
128,Apps,"Overhauling the creative economy turns out to be quite tricky. Following massive backlash, Patreon is at least temporarily pausing its plan to change its payment processing fee structure on December 18th from charging creators 2-10 percent on the first of the next month to charging patrons 2.9 percent plus $0.35 per transaction upfront and on the monthly anniversary of their first pledge beyond the 5 percent Patreon takes. ¡°We messed up. We¡¯re sorry, and we¡¯re not rolling out the fees change,¡± CEO Jack Conte writes. He tells me, ¡°We got in the way of the creators and their fans.¡±The subscription content crowdfunding company¡¯s goal was to prevent patrons from being able to sign up and get access to exclusive content and then cancel their subscription before paying on the first of the next month, and to avoid users being charged immediately and then again on the first of the next month so they¡¯d essentially be doubled billed if they pledged near the end of the month. Pro-rating wouldn¡¯t work either since patrons could sign up for a big $100-a-month subscription, experience super-premium access to content, then cancel a day later having only paid $3.Patreon CEO Jack ConteBut the problem with the fee change was that it prevented batching payments so patrons would pay just one processing fee for all their different pledges, and instead charged patrons the fee on every different campaign they support. This significantly boosted fees for patrons who only pledge a dollar or two per campaign, and ones that pledge to multiple campaigns and therefore get charged multiple fees. Patreon also admits it didn¡¯t get enough direct feedback from creators and rushed a mere two-week timeline for implementing the change.So after a painful week of calls with creators who said patrons had cancelled their subscriptions to avoid the higher fees, Patreon is halting the change until it can receive more feedback and find a better path forward. The retreat shows a level of maturity at the company, even if also some lack of foresight.Patreon raised $60 million earlier this year at a $450 million valuation to build out more monetization tools for content creators, from video makers and comedians to illustrators and models. With $107 million in funding, many assumed Patreon was on stable enough financial footing to avoid having to change from its existing fee structure where it takes a mere 5 percent rake ? compared to typical 30 percent charged by platforms like Apple and Google¡¯s App Stores and 45 percent charged by Facebook and YouTube for ad revenue shares.But ¡°the system that my co-founder came up with 4 years ago in 25 days¡± needs to be updated. Patreon has to abide by credit card processing rules while keeping enough revenue to stay alive. Conte tells me Patreon still has a bunch of new premium tools in the works for creators, a storefront for selling merchandise for example, that will be unveiled in the coming year and will help it earn more money to keep the platform sustainable. But many creators surely construed the payment structure change as a way for Patreon to jack up fees.The episode demonstrates just how tenuous it can be to alter the foundations of monetization systems that independent creators rely on. YouTube has had its own problems with creator backlash after pulling ads and demonetizing more videos and creators in order to appeal to family friendly advertisers. Conte tells me the plan going forward is to ¡°work more with creators one-on-one, show them the problems that we¡¯re trying to address, get more feedback earlier, give creators more lead time, do more qualitative research . . . and honor the idea of letting creators own their relationships and run their businesses the way they want to run them.¡±After speaking at length with Conte, though, Patreon seems stuck between a rock and a hard place. Keeping the fee structure sustainable for the startup, preventing creators from having their content accessed without fair payment and avoiding overcharging patrons for processing fees or fractions of a month of access seems somewhat intractable, otherwise the company would have come in with a better solution than its first attempt. We¡¯ll see if it can create something that works for everyone."
129,Apps,"One of the reasons recently IPO¡¯d Stitch Fix became so popular among female shoppers is because of how it pairs the convenience of home try-on for clothing and accessories with a personal styling service that adapts to your tastes over time. But often, personal stylists bring their own subjective takes on fashion to their customers. A new startup called Lily aims to offer a more personalized service that takes into account not just what¡¯s on trend or what looks good, but also how women feel about their bodies and how the right clothing can impact those perceptions.The company has now closed on $2 million in seed funding from NEA and other investors to further develop its technology, which today involves an iOS application, web app and API platform that retailers can integrate with their own catalogs and digital storefronts.To better understand a woman¡¯s personal preferences around fashion, Lily uses a combination of algorithms and machine learning techniques to recommend clothing that fits, flatters and makes a woman feel good.At the start, Lily asks the user a few basic questions about body type and style preferences, but it also asks women how perceive their body.For example, if Lily asks about bra size, it wouldn¡¯t just ask for the size a woman wears, but also how they think of this body part.¡°I¡¯m well-endowed,¡± a woman might respond, even if she¡¯s only a full B or smaller C ? which is not necessarily the reality. This sort of response helps to teach Lily about how the woman thinks of her body and its various parts, to help it craft its recommendations. That same woman may want to minimize her chest, or she may like to show off her cleavage, she may say.But as she shops Lily¡¯s recommendations in this area, the service learns what sorts of items the woman actually chooses and then adapts accordingly.This focus on understanding women¡¯s feelings about clothing is something that sets Lily apart.¡°Women are looking for clothes to spotlight the parts of their body they feel most comfortable with and hide the ones that make them feel insecure,¡± explains Lily co-founder and CEO, Purva Gupta. ¡°A customer makes a decision because based on whether a specific cut will hide her belly or downplay a feature they don¡¯t like. Yet stores do nothing to guide women toward these preferences or take the time to understand the reasons behind their selections,¡± she says.Gupta came up with the idea for Lily after moving to New York from India, where she felt overwhelmed by the foreign shopping culture. She was surrounded by so much choice, but didn¡¯t know how to find the clothing that would fit her well, or those items that would make her feel good when wearing them.She wondered if her intimidation was something American women ? not just immigrants like herself ? also felt. For a year, Gupta interviewed others, asking them one question: what prompted them to buy the last item of clothing they purchased, either online or offline? She learned that those choices were often prompted by emotions.Being able to create a service that could match up the right clothing based on those feelings was a huge challenge, however.¡°I knew that this was a very hard problem, and this was a technology problem,¡± says Gupta. ¡°There¡¯s only one way to solve this at scale ? to use technology, especially artificial intelligence, deep learning and machine learning. That¡¯s going to help me do this at scale at any store.¡±To train Lily¡¯s algorithms, the company spent two-and-half years building out its collection of 50 million plus data points and analyzing over a million product recommendations for users. The end result is that an individual item of clothing may have over 1,000 attributes assigned to it, which is then used to match up with the thousands of attributes associated with the user in question.¡°This level of detail is not available anywhere,¡± notes Gupta.In Lily¡¯s app, which works as something of a demo of the technology at hand, users can shop recommendations from 60 stores, ranging from Forever 21 to Nordstrom, in terms of price. (Lily today makes affiliate revenue from sales).In addition, the company is now beginning to pilot its technology with a handful of retailers on their own sites ? details it plans to announce in a few months¡¯ time. This will allow shoppers to get unique, personalized recommendations online that could also be translated to the offline store in the form of reserved items awaiting you when you¡¯re out shopping.Though it¡¯s early days for Lily, its hypothesis is proving correct, says Gupta.¡°We¡¯ve seen between 10x to 20x conversion rates,¡± she claims. ¡°That¡¯s what¡¯s very exciting and promising, and why these big retailers are talking to us.¡±The pilot tests are paid, but the pricing details for Lily¡¯s service for retailers are not yet set in stone so the company declined to speak about them.The startup was also co-founded by?CTO Sowmiya Chocka Narayanan, previously of Box and Pocket Gems. It¡¯s?now a team of 16 full-time in Palo Alto.In addition to NEA, other backers include?Global Founders Capital, Triplepoint Capital, Think + Ventures, Varsha Rao (Ex-COO of Airbnb, COO of Clover Health), Geoff Donaker (Ex-COO of Yelp), Jed Nachman?(COO, Yelp), Unshackled Ventures and others."

So, they might not always fit in your apartment.Wholesale goods?are the primary play for a startup called Boxed, a retailer looking to play the sort of digital-to-your-door Costco game. But there might be a bit of a challenge visualizing?how big those packages are, so the company built an augmented reality tool to demo the sheer size of that massive box of Mac and Cheese you might buy through the app.?All things said?the AR demo is a?little bit of a joke. Built during a hackathon, Fong said that it¡¯s primarily a way to help get the brand out there.It¡¯s a fun little application, though there will probably be a segment of the universe that would appreciate a warning as to how big a wholesale package of toilet paper will be when sitting in their apartment. Instead, the tool is matched with two other feature updates the company is rolling out: a chatbot?and group orders.¡°It was a fun project for us to build, and one of the things that we kind of like to hammer in is the idea we sell these bulk goods,¡± CTO William Fong said. ¡°Being able to envision bulk sizes versus retail sizes plays into the brand. The idea behind it was to convey the idea of bulk, help reinforce the measures that hey these products you¡¯re getting are bigger than your retail packs. It¡¯s really gonna help you stock up for the long run. It¡¯s kind of like a branding but also provide a little practical value for those who might find it challenging to say, ¡®how might I fit this in my apartment?'¡±Group orders help?existing Boxed users summon in their housemates or family members to add products to a Boxed order. But those additional shoppers don¡¯t actually have to log in or sign up for an app, and instead just open up a link and start adding various products to the basket. Then the original user checks out, sending off the order to the company¡¯s fulfillment centers. The extra shoppers will get a prompt at the end of the session to sign up for Boxed, as it¡¯s obviously a user acquisition play as well, though users aren¡¯t required to sign up afterward.Boxed¡¯s play is to try to always keep you stocked up, to the point that it¡¯ll try to figure out ahead of time when you¡¯re about to run out of toilet paper or snacks. You could easily order those kinds of products on Amazon, though Fong says the play for Boxed is to have a small set of huge wholesale products that it can store in its fulfillment centers and ship out. By doing that, it can be more efficient and be able to potentially compete with Amazon, Fong said.¡°When you go to Amazon, it¡¯s very transactional,¡± Fong said. ¡°You check out with 1 or 2 things, what we notice with Boxed is our customers behave differently. They¡¯re taking more time to finish checkout process because?they¡¯re browsing. This might go to multiple sessions, days or weeks.¡±The company also said it¡¯ll roll out a chatbot with some limited functionality, which allows users to shop through Facebook Messenger instead of having to go through the app. A chatbot might potentially fragment the user experience and yank potential shoppers out of the app, but Fong said they were trying to have a stripped-down experience that would make more sense in a messaging format. The bot may also help re-engage users, Fong said.So, two new features that could?actually be useful to shoppers looking to buy wholesale goods, and one that may-or-may-not-be-useful feature in the AR addition ? though, as far niche apps go, this niche is a pretty good one."
131,Apps,"In 2012, a Raleigh, NC-based company called WedPics launched on to the scene to make wedding photos a little less of a headache. Five years and seven million users later, WedPics is being acquired by Mixbook, the platform for digitally collecting and editing physical photo books.The terms of the deal were not disclosed.WedPics is an app that lets a bride and groom aggregate all the photos from their wedding in a single place. Oftentimes, the happy couple will set out disposable cameras and use Instagram hashtags to aggregate photos taken by guests at the wedding. Collecting all of those photos after the fact can be tedious.With WedPics, the couple simply sends an invite to the app to everyone attending the wedding. Folks upload all the photos they take to the app so the couple and guests alike can easily see everything in one place.The app itself is free, but premium upgrades like the ability to print high-res source files, customize the overall look and feel of the digital album and use personalized URLs, are also available on the platform.More recently, WedPics introduced printing to let people create physical photo albums of their wedding, which accounts for about 60 percent of the company¡¯s revenue.This falls in line with Mixbook¡¯s business, which focuses primarily on the digital to print business. As we move more and more towards a fully digital existence, weddings remain one of the biggest reasons to print out actual photos.As part of the deal, a ¡®handful¡¯ of WedPics 15 employees will head to Mixbook, according to WedPics founder and CEO Justin Miller. The WedPics brand and service will continue operating under the umbrella of Mixbook, who will help the company with its print business."

In addition, Line¡¯s implementation of the feature displays a notification in the chat room indicating that a message has been deleted.Which means there will always be a trace of any regretful texts you¡¯ve sent in the previous hours ? even if you¡¯re gaining the ability to nix the actual content.Mobile and desktop versions of Line support unsend, with the (current) exception of the Google Chrome version of Line which will only let users receive notifications for messages their friends unsend. ¡°If you wish to unsend a particular message, please use Line on a different device,¡± it notes on that.An additional caveat?for the feature to work as billed is that you¡¯ll need everyone in a chat where you want to recall a message to have updated to the version of Line that supports the feature. So there will inevitably be a period of time when unsend will not work as intended.But, down the line, once all your contacts have updated their apps then Line message recalls should be good to go.To use the feature, a Line user needs to press (or right click) on the specific message or content they want to recall and then select ¡®unsend¡¯ from the menu."
133,Apps,"Startups die by suicide, not competition. It wasn¡¯t that anyone was stealing SoundCloud¡¯s?underground rappers, bedroom remixers and garage bands. SoundCloud stumbled because it neglected these hardcore loyalists as it wrongly strove to usurp Spotify as the streaming home of music¡¯s superstars. But four months ago, after laying off 40 percent of its staff, SoundCloud scored a do-or-die investment of $169.5 million that saved the company and brought in a new CEO. Now the question is whether SoundCloud can get back in the groove. I sounded the alarm about SoundCloud¡¯s mishandled headcount cuts, misguided direction and morale problems, so it feels important to lend some suggestions alongside the criticism.SoundCloud has something no one else does: the world¡¯s biggest archive of user-uploaded music and audio ? around 120 million tracks. And so that must be the center of the service.It once was, but rather than doubling down on independent creators, helping them monetize with ads and commerce and selling subscriptions to enhanced ad-free access, SoundCloud wasted years chasing the major record labels in hopes of building a Spotify competitor full of the most popular music. Finally in mid-2016 it launched the $9.99 SoundCloud Go+ subscription with ad-free access to mainstream music and indie stuff, but it was already years behind Spotify and Apple Music.In the meantime, the distraction led to extraordinarily slow progress on scaling up advertising, both in terms of the volume of ads on the sites and the independent artists who could get a revenue share. Ads weren¡¯t a big part of SoundCloud, so many users don¡¯t feel it¡¯s worth paying to get rid of them. Creators strayed to YouTube and Patreon, investing their attention and driving their audience to where they could earn money. And spurious take-downs of creators¡¯ music that they already paid SoundCloud to host further burned the company¡¯s cred with its core constituents.It¡¯s on this guy, SoundCloud¡¯s new CEO Kerry Trainor, to right the ship. I¡¯ve met him, and he¡¯s cooler than he seems.? (Photo by Todd Williamson/WireImage)Luckily, SoundCloud has now booted its former management team, replacing Alex Ljung with former Vimeo CEO Kerry Trainor. That gives SoundCloud an opportunity to realign its strategy with the creators who made it unique in the first place. Here¡¯s what we think it needs to do:SoundCloud will never be the No. 1 pop music streaming platform, and it needs to accept that. It got started on subscriptions too late and doesn¡¯t have the industry buy-in the way Spotify does from taking the labels on as investors, nor the recommendation data Spotify got from acquiring Echo Nest, nor the massive device install base or war chest to leverage like Apple Music, nor massive ad-supported audience like 1 billion-user YouTube.So instead of trying to compete with the big dogs directly, SoundCloud should invade from downstream. Rather than marketing its $10 SoundCloud Go+ subscription to casual music fans, it should concentrate on locking in hardcore listeners who love its indie stuff via its free tier or $5 SoundCloud Go subscription just for user-generated content. Then it should upsell them to the $10 plan by touting the convenience of listening to everything in one place, rather than paying $10 a month just for mainstream music elsewhere. The $5 plan should be the focus, and the $10 plan should be the bonus.[Update 12/14/17: SoundCloud has just redesigned its home screen to feature personalized playlists that can highlight the best of its unique catalog.SoundCloud buddied up to the major labels at the expense of the DJs who fueled its ascent. The legal grey area of unofficial remixes and DJ sets are what made SoundCloud indispensable, but are also what got criminalized and sometimes booted off the platform after its label deals. SoundCloud needs to figure out how to settle the copyright payouts on this kind of content so it can stay up on the platform. Whether that means developing its own rights disbursement technology, partnering with a provider of this payout distribution tech like Dubset or outright acquiring it, SoundCloud must be a safe home for this content you can¡¯t find anywhere else. Otherwise, SoundCloud isn¡¯t special.Everyone knows streaming music platforms only pay out a fraction of a cent per listen. That can add up to millions a year if you¡¯re Taylor Swift, but often isn¡¯t enough to support the livelihood of smaller niche artists. But no matter how big or small, almost every artist has a percentage of listeners who are die-hard fans, willing to pay far more than they¡¯d earn a creator in streaming royalties or ad-revenue share.That¡¯s why artists of all types have turned to subscription patronage platforms like Patreon, where you don¡¯t need millions of fans, just a few thousand paying a buck a month. YouTube, Apple Music and even Spotify have failed to go deep in assisting artists with direct commerce. YouTube is testing Patreon-esque Sponsorships, and Spotify offers some tiny merchandise and concert ticket options on artist profiles.BYRON BAY, AUSTRALIA ? MARCH 27: Fans react to The Wailers performing live onstage at the 2016 Byron Bay Bluesfest on March 27, 2016 in Byron Bay, Australia. (Photo by Mark Metcalfe/Getty Images)But SoundCloud has a massive opportunity here because it knows its artists can¡¯t sustain themselves on royalties, and the type of listeners on SoundCloud are serious music aficionados. SoundCloud should provide bold options for artists to sell merch and tickets and teach them how to use data to create goods their fans want to buy.That also means pushing artists toward new revenue streams like offering exclusive experiences. Help artists sell phone calls, meet-and-greets, signed memorabilia, webcam footage of studio sessions, exclusive video streams and more. And finally, provide a channel for artists to communicate directly with their top listeners in more intimate ways than email blasts and Twitter broadcasts.SoundCloud should be the modern fan club. In an era where you don¡¯t ¡°own¡± music anymore, the app¡¯s audience of early adopting hipsters might be eager to show their allegiance to their favorite artists with their wallets, not just their ears. And that¡¯s good for everyone.Let Spotify and Apple Music be the impersonal place for superstars who don¡¯t care about you. SoundCloud could give listeners a deeper experience, artists a bigger paycheck and itself a lucrative corner of the otherwise overcrowded music space. So, Kerry, what are you gonna do?"
134,Apps,"Last year HotelTonight launched HT Perks, their own twist on a hotel loyalty program.The program is level-based, meaning user ¡°level up¡± as they meet certain tiers of lifetime spend in the app. It was generally well received but maybe a little under ambitious ? it?maxed out at level 4 ? which granted a user as much as 20% off in extra savings after spending a lifetime total of $5,000 in the app.So today they are updating the program and expanding these four tiers to an infinite amount.In the new program users get a discount off of base rates once they hit level 2 at $250 in lifetime spend, and that discount doubles at level 3 for $1k lifetime spend, triples at level 4 for $2k lifetime spend. and quadruples at level 8 for $6k in lifetime spend.After hitting level 4 for $2k lifetime spend, you level up each $1,000 you spend. So level 5 would be $3k, level 6 would be $4k and so on.?Unlike rewards programs for most airlines and hotels, your ¡°status¡± never expires, making the program useful for both frequent and infrequent travelers.You also get $30 in coupons each time you hit a new level (besides the main tiers that give you a percentage discount) which is essentially equal to 3% cash back.The whole thing is little complicated, at least until you get to level 5 where it becomes a straight $1k spent per level increase. But HotelTonight said they adjusted the thresholds to match their booking patterns, and to ensure that more hotels opt in to offering the special Perks rates. Basically they had to readjust the levels to make sure certain levels didn¡¯t have too many (or too few) users. Today about 50% of all hotels opt in, which should increase after today¡¯s changes.There¡¯s one other cool feature coming with this upgrade, called Save for Later. This lets you use any discount on HotelTonight including GeoRate, Perks discounts, and the $30 coupons at a later date. So if the base rate tonight is $200 but your Perks status is giving you 5% off, you can choose to use the $10 discount when you book or save it for a future booking.This should be popular among business customers, who would rather save their discounts for a personal booking and not use them on ones paid for by the company ? just like most do with hotel and airline points. Sam Shank, founder and CEO of HotelTonight explained that in testing they also saw customers use the feature like a savings account ? i.e., accumulating small discounts from each stay and saving them for a special trip.The update launches today, and all accumulated spending transfers to the new program."
135,Apps,"Twitter today is announcing the launch of a new feature that will allow people to more easily post tweetstorms ? that is, those series of connected tweets that have grown to become a popular workaround for getting past Twitter¡¯s character count limitation in order to share longer thoughts. The company confirmed last month?it was testing the feature ? which it¡¯s now calling ¡°threads¡± ? across its iOS and Android apps.The tweetstorm format has been used for a long time on Twitter, initially by a small number of early adopters, including a16z co-founder Marc Andreessen, who would often pen the equivalent of?blog posts using tweets.The need for tweetstorms became more pressing over the years, as users continually bumped up against Twitter¡¯s 140 character count limit ? a restriction Twitter recently doubled, ahead of today¡¯s launch.Users have adopted the tweetstorm for a number of reasons ? to tell personal, suspenseful or funny stories via Twitter, to connect facts surrounding breaking news, to rant about politics or other issues, or even to just make a longer post more readable and easier to follow.There are now hundreds of thousands of threads tweeted out every day, notes Twitter.Despite Twitter¡¯s new character limit of 280, tweetstorms remain in use. The feature has essentially become a Twitter convention at this point ? and the company has a history of taking inspiration from its user base in developing new features. The @reply, the hashtag, and the RT were all launched as official products based on patterns of user behavior, for example. Now the same thing is happening with threads.The threads feature itself is easy enough to use. There¡¯s now a new plus (¡°+¡±) button in the composer screen where you can type out your series of tweets.Each line represents one tweet, with a character limit of 280 as per usual. You can also add the same amount of media ? like GIFs, images, videos, and more ? to any individual tweet in the thread, as you could on Twitter directly. When you¡¯re finished with one tweet, you just tap in the space below to continue your thread.While writing out your tweetstorm, you can go back and edit the tweets at any time as they¡¯re still in draft format. When you¡¯re ready to post, you tap the ¡°Tweet all¡± button at the top to send the stream to Twitter. (Twitter will pace the tweets¡¯ posting a bit so they don¡¯t all hit at once.)In addition, another handy feature allows you to go back and update a thread by adding new tweets after it already posted. To do so, you¡¯ll write out the new tweet after tapping the ¡°Add another Tweet¡± button. This lets you continue to update a thread forever ? something Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey already?does with his own threads, for example.Twitter tells us there¡¯s currently a limit of 25 entries in a thread, but that number may be subject to change depending on how the feature is adopted by the wider user base.The company is also responding to users¡¯ concerns that by making tweetstorms more accessible to people, the Twitter timeline will become cluttered with longer posts that slow down users¡¯ ability to quickly scan through posts, the way you can now. It says that a thread from someone with two or three tweets will appear in your timeline connected by a line to distinguish it, but when there are four or more tweets, the thread is truncated.In that case, you¡¯ll see an option to ¡°Show this thread.¡± If you click or tap on this message, the full thread will expand. This allows users to share their longer tweetstorms, but without taking over your timeline in the process.Twitter says threads will begin rolling out today to everyone on iOS, Android and the web, to reach the full user base over a few weeks¡¯ time."
136,Apps,"Facebook is trying to close the augmented reality gap with Snapchat with the help of an army of third-party developers. Today, eight months after debuting its Augmented Reality Camera Effects platform and AR Studio tool at F8, Facebook is allowing all developers to start building AR experiences for its Facebook Camera. That includes ¡°World Effects¡± ? Facebook¡¯s copy of Snapchat¡¯s World Lenses ? that augment your environment with 3D objects rather than just your selfies.AR Studio becomes available to all developers today, and World Effects will open up there in the next few days for use on Facebook and Messenger. For example, on Messenger you¡¯ll be able to add a 3D heart floating above someone¡¯s head, add an arrow to point to something in a panorama or add a celebrating robot that plays music to jazz up a drab video.Facebook¡¯s new World Effects¡°We want artists, developers, brands and more creators to be able to build and share amazing AR experiences,¡± writes Facebook director Ficus Kirkpatrick. ¡°By opening AR Studio to all creators, we¡¯re taking steps towards making AR more a part of everyday life.¡±Facebook¡¯s opportunity here is to take advantage of Snapchat¡¯s anti-developer attitude. Snapchat has yet to fully embrace third-party AR content beyond some basic image frame submissions and work with a few fine artists like Jeff Koons. Meanwhile, Facebook has been operating a developer platform for more than a decade, and has fostered a huge community of coders looking to get their content in front of Facebook¡¯s massive 2 billion user audience.Since launching the Camera Effects platform, Facebook has worked with more than 2,000 brands, publishers and artists to make AR experiences. This could lay the groundwork for Sponsored World Effects, which might let businesses pay to offer branded AR toys inside of Facebook.Facebook¡¯s AR Studio makes it easy to tie animations and imagery to certain cues like someone raising their eyebrows¡°We¡¯ve been continuously advancing the capabilities of the platform, with improved face tracking, new graphics capabilities, better scripting, and now world effects. This is only the beginning, and we can¡¯t wait to see how creators bring art to life through AR Studio.¡±Users can open the Facebook or Messenger Camera, scroll through the World Effects and tap to add one to what they¡¯re seeing. Some other launch experiences include a unicorn you can play with, or the ability to add floating 3D word bubbles like ¡°love,¡± ¡°bae,¡± ¡°heart¡± and ¡°miss you.¡±Facebook has encountered some stumbling blocks in its quest for AR. Facebook Stories, where Camera Effects content is typically shared, hasn¡¯t taken off the way Instagram Stories has. Now it¡¯s resorted to allowing users to cross-post to Facebook Stories from Instagram or Messenger, but they still don¡¯t get many views. Meanwhile, Apple¡¯s ARKit and Google¡¯s ARCore give developers an alternative way to build AR into their own apps at the operating system level rather than having to piggyback on Facebook.Essentially, Facebook¡¯s best lure to developers is its inherent reach thanks to a massive baked-in audience. But if Facebook Stories aren¡¯t popular to watch, that audience isn¡¯t easily accessible. Its best bet might be opening the Camera Effects platform and World Lenses to Instagram where tons of people watch Stories.The real world is too vast for a single company to spice up with augmented reality. But by crowdsourcing development, Facebook could eventually offer AR experiences connected to any location, real-world object, holiday or activity. That breadth of offering will be key to becoming the default way people explore the AR world. Whichever app offers the most and best experiences will be the one people wave in the air to see what¡¯s hidden out of view."
137,Apps,"Instagram has always been a social network where you follow friends and creators, but today it¡¯s evolving with a new way to follow hashtags so you see top posts and Stories about a topic on your home page. Rather than having to dig this content out of search or the Explore tab, you can see the best #Slime videos or #FloralNails tutorials no matter who posts them.Today¡¯s change will require some smart filtering by Instagram to prevent objectionable content or spam from being distributed by hashtag following. But it has the potential to help users see beyond their own social graphs and dive deeper into niche communities they care about, making Instagram more endless. Eventually, hashtag following could give the app more powerful ad targeting data and an opportunity to show more interstitial ads between Stories, but the company says it¡¯s not doing either right now.Instagram was first spotted testing hashtag following last month by?Pippa Akram?and?The Next Web. Today it rolls out to all users, who will see a Follow button on hashtag pages they reach through search or clicking on one of the tags.We asked Instagram how posts get chosen to be shown to a hashtag¡¯s followers, and learned that Instagram algorithmically selects the best ones based on factors such as recency and quality. That means just because someone punches in a ton of popular hashtags on their posts doesn¡¯t mean you¡¯ll necessarily see them unless they¡¯re great. You¡¯ll also be able to effectively downvote posts you didn¡¯t want to see from hashtags with a drop-down menu in the top-right corner.To weed out spam and objectionable content, Instagram will use automated and manual systems for flagging inappropriate posts and blocking their authors. Hundreds of people on its community operations team will be monitoring user and automated reports to review content 24/7. The company says that over the past few months it¡¯s made improvements to how it sources and ranks hashtag content to ensure what¡¯s shown on hashtag pages is safe, and uses large teams to analyze hashtag trends.Instagram¡¯s hashtags are another expression of Facebook¡¯s new overarching mission to ¡°bring the world closer together.¡± Like Facebook¡¯s Groups, hashtag following lets users explore outside of their own social bubble.

It¡¯s a major update to the company¡¯s flagship app. It still features what made djay popular in the first place, such as Spotify integration and a native look-and-feel. But it also adds many small and big improvements that turn it into a powerful DJ app for your next house party.djay has been around for more than a decade. It was first a top seller in Apple stores back when you had to buy a box to get a new app. It then attracted over 30 million downloads. There are now 1 million active users playing 300 million tracks every year. Algoriddim won two Apple Design Awards for djay in 2011 and 2016 ? the most recent one was for accessibility.djay Pro 2 features a brand new interface that feels right at home on macOS. You can open and close panels quite easily so that you can see more tools or more songs in your library.The waveforms have been improved and now look more detailed. You can zoom to an incredibly precise level in case you want to set a cue point at the exact time.When you¡¯re switching from one track to the other, you can choose to keep playing effects on the original track thanks to a new fade-out effect option.These are just the low hanging fruits that help keep djay Pro fresh. But there are also a handful of major new features, starting with a DJ library. In djay Pro 2, you can add a folder with a bunch of MP3s, browse your iTunes library or browse your Spotify playlists or the entire Spotify catalog.But even if you would rather use Spotify for everything, you just can¡¯t find every single obscure remix on the music streaming service. Previously, if you wanted to use multiple services, it was a pain as you needed to switch from one tab to the other.Now, you can build a library of songs that would work well in your DJ set. They can come from different sources, and this library is saved on iCloud. Building your library is quite easy as you can split the music browser and drag and drop songs from one service to your personal library.djay Pro also has a video mixing element. You can plug your computer to a TV or projector and mix with videos. But even if you don¡¯t want to spend too much time on video mixing in order to focus on the music, there¡¯s a new PhotoBeat mode. You can adjust the frequency and match photos with the beat of your songs in real time.Finally Automix mode has been overhauled and now works like magic. ¡°We¡¯re introducing Automix AI and we¡¯re using a lot of artificial intelligence variables,¡± Product VP Michael Simmons told me.The app analyzes the structure of a song to figure out the best intros and outros and then automagically turns the EQ and filter knobs to create a smooth transition. It¡¯s quite impressive to see in real time and it even removes a bit of the magic behind mixing. I could see this kind of technology in music playing apps as well. It¡¯s a much better way to skip to the next song than crossfading.Overall, I thought my mixing days were behind me, but playing with the app just feels nice. It doesn¡¯t feel like you¡¯re fighting against a clunky app. And the fact that you don¡¯t have to put together an MP3 library anymore is a huge improvement.djay Pro 2 is now live on the App Store. You can buy it for $49.99, but there¡¯s a launch sale at $39.99. You can also download a free trial on the company¡¯s website. The app works with over 60 MIDI controllers, including Pioneer CDJ controllers. Now, let¡¯s see if Algoriddim is going to bring some of those new features to other platforms."

This is data Tinder users could already see, had their matches connected these external accounts to their profile.The idea is to present this information in a new format.Explains the company, the Feed is meant to take users beyond the match in order to make ¡°real¡± connections, it says in the announcement.The Feed is something that could, at least in theory, help to spark conversations between matches. After all, the hardest part of using a dating app where you have to begin a chat session with a perfect stranger is finding something to chat about when you know so little about them.Even after a cursory glance through a Tinder profile, you may not immediately know what they¡¯re interested in or what they do for fun in their free time. But their musical tastes and social media posts can give you a better idea.The thought here is if you see something interesting pop up on the Feed, you?would then have an opener for your chat.Tinder says you can start these Feed-initiated chats by double-tapping on the content that¡¯s shared, then responding to it directly. Users can also control what appears in the Feed from the app¡¯s Settings or by editing your profile.The concept is not entirely dissimilar from the way users connect over posts and photos shared on rival dating app, Hinge, in fact. On Hinge, each individual text entry or shared photo can be replied to, allowing you to respond not to the profile itself, but to a specific thing you read or saw posted to that profile. Tinder¡¯s implementation changes this to a continually updating?feed instead.The feature could also make it easier on those users who aren¡¯t sure what sort of information to include in a profile, or have left off something notable about them ? like a favorite band, or a regular hobby ? things their social media and musical posts would show.But not everyone will appreciate the new format, as it may provide too visible a window into their lives, ripe for cyberstalking. It could also encourage people to be more passive about actually getting to know a fellow match in the app ? or, rather, in real life ?? as a dating app should incentivize. Users could just watch their Feed for updates instead, while spending ever more time in Tinder¡¯s app, boosting its bottom line.On the flip side, the Feed¡¯s presence could encourage a sort of narcissistic show of behavior from its more active users ? knowing that the Instagram photos they post will make their way to a new audience of potential dates could impact the type of photos users share, detracting from their authenticity. (But that¡¯s a common problem across social media, not just a Tinder issue.)Tinder says it¡¯s now testing the Feed format in?Australia, New Zealand and Canada for the time being. It didn¡¯t say if or when it would roll out to the wider user base."
141,Apps,"Another tidbit around how WhatsApp¡¯s incoming business accounts will function: According to a FAQ for users?of the messaging platform ? on ¡°Chatting with businesses¡± ? they will either have one of three status types: unconfirmed, confirmed or verified.Business accounts that have yet to be confirmed or verified will have a gray question mark badge displayed in their profile. ¡°This account is using the WhatsApp Business app, but hasn¡¯t been confirmed nor verified by WhatsApp,¡± WhatsApp writes.So these will be the business accounts to be most wary of, clearly.Then next level is confirmed ? denoted by a gray checkmark badge in the profile. ¡°WhatsApp has confirmed that the phone number of this account matches the phone number for this business,¡± it says of this tier.Finally there¡¯s verified ? which will be badged with a green checkmark, as we¡¯ve?previously reported. ¡°WhatsApp has verified that an authentic brand owns this account,¡± is what the company says of this, though it¡¯s not clear exactly what this extra verification stage involves. Nor whether this top tier will be reserved for business accounts that are paying a fee to use WhatsApp¡¯s tools.The messaging giant has long trailed that business accounts are incoming, as Facebook seeks to switch on monetization without out-and-out injecting ads into a platform whose founders vowed they never would. It has been actively testing the new account type?since the summer.In September it announced there will be a free app for small to medium businesses to use to reach customers. Though it¡¯s still yet to confirm when this will launch. (At the time of writing WhatsApp had not responded to our questions.) Enterprises will have to pay to use the incoming business tools.In an addendum at the end of the FAQ, WhatsApp further notes: ¡°Business verification and confirmation don¡¯t indicate an endorsement by WhatsApp¡± ? suggesting it¡¯s trying to steer clear of the sorts of problems Twitter has encountered with its own checkmark badge verification process for Twitter accounts which ran into controversy after users accused the company of effectively endorsing neo-nazis.Last month Twitter responded to the backlash?by changing its verification rules and starting to?remove blue checkmarks from white supremacists."
142,Apps,"Apple has quietly allowed developers to make their apps available for pre-order.It¡¯s a basic feature ? as Android fanatics will point out ? but nevertheless one that has been missing from the App Store.Upcoming apps will now be allowed to list in the App Store as far out as 90 days ahead of their launch and as close as two days before. This applies to new apps not updates to existing ones.Once the app is released, it will be automatically downloaded to a user¡¯s device if they hit the pre-order button. In cases where there¡¯s a price for the app, as is common with games, the customer will only be charged once?the app is ready for download. Users are free to cancel their pre-orders before the launch date arrives.Most interest is likely to be driven by direct-to-user marketing from companies ? Apple is giving developers special branding to help on that front ? but apps?can also be found under the new ¡°Pre-Orders¡± section within the Games tab of the App Store. That¡¯s available in the U.S. but it doesn¡¯t appear to have come to the App Store in UK and other global markets just yet.The change comes more than a year after Apple allowed users to register to be notified when a new app is available in the App Store ? Super Mario Run was the first real usage of that.Handling the download automatically makes a lot more sense, particular given the deluge of notifications that users get these days, plus it truly opens?the door for businesses to market their upcoming apps and services ahead of time."
143,Apps,"The organization behind MyEtherWallet is planning to release an official version of its popular cryptocurrency wallet for iOS after Apple removed a knockoff that had been in the App Store for around a week.The unofficial version of the open source software, which is used to hold ETH and other alt coins outside of bitcoin, got as high as number three in the financial section of the App Store thanks to a crypto boom fueled by the continued rise in value of bitcoin, which blew past $17,000 last week. The same wave saw Coinbase hit the top spot for overall downloads in the U.S..The now-removed iOS app was priced at $4.99 and it had been downloaded around 3,000 times, according to estimates from Apptopia.The good news for?users of MyEtherWallet is that the company has plans to introduce an official app. A representative told TechCrunch that an iOS app is currently in development."
144,Apps,"Google today is launching a trio of new photo apps ? a part of new series of what it has dubbed photography ¡°appsperiments.¡± (Get it? Ha ha.) The apps, some of which are available on both the iOS App Store and Google Play, give Google a way to test out more experimental features to see how users respond, the company explains in an announcement on its Google Research blog.The apps involve a number of technologies now in development at Google, including those focused on?object recognition,?person segmentation, stylization algorithms, efficient image encoding and decoding technologies, Google says.Specifically, the three apps in question are called Storyboard,?Selfissimo!, and?Scrubbies.The first, Storyboard, turns videos into single-page comic layouts on your device. Turning photos into images inspired by art ? including comic book art ? is something that grew popular with the launch of the A.I.-powered editing app Prisma. While that company has more recently shifted focus to b2b, its consumer app still ranks in the top 150 in the Photo & Video category on the App Store. But attention for this sort of creative photography has waned a bit. Perhaps turning it on for video could bring it back to the limelight again?Storyboard is a new take on those art-inspired photo effects apps. Instead of turning a photo into comic book art, it automatically selects interesting frames from a video then lays them out using one of six visual styles.Storyboard is Android-only for now.The second app, Selfissimo!, is designed for selfies, as the name implies.In this case, the app is an automated selfie photographer that takes black and white photos of you every time you pose. Whenever you stop moving, a new photo is taken. The end result is a contact sheet of photos ? like you¡¯d have from a real photoshoot. (But hey, Google, c¡¯mon, we need more than just B&W photos here!)This one is available on both iOS and Android.The third, Scrubbies, is designed for video. This app lets you change the speed and direction of video playback to create looping videos. Instead of looping apps like Instagram¡¯s Boomerang, Scrubbies has you go hands-on. You actually swipe on the video itself to ¡°remix¡± it. Google describes this process as ¡°scratching it like a D.J.¡± One finger plays the video, while two fingers captures the playback for you to save and share.Scrubbies is iOS-only.This is not the first time Google has launched experimental photography apps.Google researchers developed Motion Stills to make iOS¡¯s Live Videos less shaky, then brought a variation of that app to Android to offer a new recording experience for shooting sharable clips. This same Live Photo editing technology was also baked into the main Google Photos app, after some initial testing.That means it¡¯s possible that ? if all goes well with the new app experiments ? the features they offer could eventually make their way to Google Photos, as well.Google also hinted that these three apps may be the first of many tests to ? the company tells us they¡¯re the ¡°first installment¡± in a series of ¡°appsperiments.¡±"
145,Apps,"Facebook¡¯s ¡°Poke¡± feature has never really gone away, but now the social network is giving it a more prominent placement ? and is even considering expanding the set of casual greeting options to include others, like a wink, wave, high-five or hug.Though Facebook had never really discontinued the age-old feature, which serves as a quick way to get someone¡¯s attention on its network, it has now given the Poke a highly visible spot.At the top of users¡¯ profiles on mobile, the Poke button sits next to a Message button, and right below your friend¡¯s name and photo.The Poke is one of Facebook¡¯s oldest features. It existed at a time when the social network was still called Thefacebook, and there wasn¡¯t as much to do on the site as there is today. The meaning of the Poke was never defined, as Facebook decided to leave it up to interpretation.¡°When we created the poke, we thought it would be cool to have a feature without any specific purpose,¡± Facebook had explained in the past. ¡°People interpret the poke in many different ways, and we encourage you to come up with your own meanings.¡±Of course, many people took the Poke to be a form of virtual flirting while others saw it as more of? a joke. Poke wars between friends ensued, as well.Now it looks like Facebook wants to give the Poke another shot.The new Poke button¡¯s placement also makes it easier accidental Pokes to occur, when you were aiming for the Message button instead, or just browsing through a user¡¯s profile.For this reason, not everyone is thrilled with the new button, it seems:The new Facebook app makes it too easy to poke people. That was supposed to be hard to get to so girls knew you were really thinking about them.? Dave M (@dmm117) December 3, 2017Okay, but Facebook has now made it far too easy to accidentally ¡®poke¡¯ someone. It¡¯s right on the top of their profile. I don¡¯t need that stress in my life.? Er[no room at the]inn Victoria?? (@erinn_victoria) December 2, 2017Did you know you can still ¡°poke¡± people on Facebook? I didn¡¯t. Until I ACCIDENTALLY POKED SOMEONE LAST NIGHT and they poked me back. ?? Alice Smith Avery (@alicees28) December 8, 2017Because the feature is from an earlier era of Facebook history, the Poke is actually somewhat mysterious to some users who don¡¯t know what the feature does or why it¡¯s there. Others, who do remember the Poke, assumed it had been removed and has just now returned:?does anyone know what the ¡°poke¡± button on facebook means? I just found out i had 288 pokes, some were from like 2012 but i poked all them back so whatever.? Hannah Evans (@hannah_cathryn_) December 8, 2017This seems like a bad time for Facebook to bring back the ""poke"" feature.?

SMIIRK (@smiirkmusic) December 7, 2017Why did Facebook bring back the poke!? ?? Stephanie (@peaseymarie) December 7, 2017But the Poke had never been shut off for good ? it was just tucked away in the navigation. Now, it¡¯s sort of impossible to miss.Facebook isn¡¯t done with the Poke yet, either.The company has been testing a new series of greetings including?hello, high-fiving, hugging, and winking, in addition to the Poke, The Next Web recently discovered.These also sit at the top of users¡¯ profiles for those who have been added to the test group, and appear as bright, colorful buttons. (It had tested a ¡°hello¡± button earlier this year, as well.)Above: a demo of the new Greetings feature on FacebookThe idea with Greetings is to offer Facebook users more ways to reach out to friends, beyond posting to their profiles, commenting and direct messaging. With these more lightweight interactions, you can show a friend you¡¯re thinking about them with little effort on your part.But Facebook will need to be careful with the launch of Pokes and Greetings. In the past, some women said the Facebook Poke often felt like a creepy flirting tool, for example. If the new Greetings buttons or the new Poke button are available to anyone on Facebook to access, and not just a user¡¯s friends, they could be abused as a way to pester someone online.Not everyone has the test of the Greetings buttons or the new Poke button, we understand. Facebook would not confirm if or when it would make these features publicly available to all."

For most users with the company¡¯s latest flagship handset, the feature will be available today as part of an Android 8.1 update. The feature was announced on-stage at the Pixel event back in January, offering a sneak peek of a fun little addition made possible through its ARCore technology, letting users drop augmented reality characters onto their own pictures and video. It was a pretty compelling demonstration of Google¡¯s ARKit competitor, and now its live for everyone to check out, including a couple of key product licenses. Those Stranger Things stickers that we got to play with a few months back in here, bringing creatures from Netflix¡¯s popular series with them. And, a mere few days ahead of the much-anticipated release of The Last Jedi, the feature brings a bunch of new content from the Star Wars universe.The company¡¯s celebrating the launch with a pretty delightful new ad, as well, incorporating elements from The Last Jedi trailer into real world setting, with lot of kids, grownups and dogs dressed up as character from the movie. The sticker pack includes dynamic models of First Order Stormtroopers, imperial walkers, X-Wings and Tie-Fighters, familiar droids like R2D2 and BB-8 and, of course, Porgs. So, so many Porgs. As though the furry little beasts weren¡¯t all over the place already. There¡¯s also a bunch of party paraphernalia and Foodmoji, which are more in line with Snapchat¡¯s viral dancing hot dog than Apple¡¯s Animoji offer ? but should do an equally good job helping you kill time with you new phone. The sticker sets are available today for most Pixel 2 users as a free download, though some might be getting them over the next few days.?"
147,Apps,"Imgur, the hugely popular photo and GIF sharing site with?over 250 million users, is the latest to board the ephemeral storytelling train.Like the ¡®stories¡¯ feature inside Snapchat and Facebook/Instagram, which has cloned the heck of Snapchat, Imgur has moved into lean-back content with the arrival of ¡®Snacks¡¯, a new feature that sits at the top of its mobile app.With Snacks, Imgur is letting users watched an ongoing array of GIFs in one sitting. When one GIF is done, another replaces it immediately to keep the experience continuous. Unlike Snap, the content is actually standalone as?it appears to be pulled from Imgur¡¯s vast library of content.The result is something that is similar to Vine.All in all, the feature seems ideal for Imgur users who are looking to fill a little free time, perhaps on the train or bus to work, without the hassle of having to manually find content.?You can also follow GIF creators, too, making it a neat vehicle for discovery.Snacks can be found under the ¡®search¡¯ tab inside the Imgur app where they are matched to the day¡¯s feature tag ? which happens to be Ocean today.?Bad news for Android users, it looks like this feature is only on iOS at this point.Imgur started out as the de facto photo service for Reddit but over the past year it has pushed to become a solution platform in its own right. It added chat features and the ability to follow other users last year, and last month it added a favorites folder which, while minor on the surface, finally allows users to stash their favorite media in a single place.While it is smart to build a base that isn¡¯t reliant on third parties, Imgur¡¯s hand was rather forced by Reddit when it added image uploads in May 2016?to end its reliance in Imgur. Reddit has since added more social features like location tagging and its own video platform, to continue the separation.It hasn¡¯t all been plain sailing for Imgur, though. More than 1.7 million emails and passwords were affected by a 2014 hack which was disclosed last month by Imgur.The hack wasn¡¯t anything like the size of Yahoo ? which is owned by TechCrunch parents AOL and Verizon and had most of its three billions users affected by a series of attacks ? or Uber, which recently disclosed that 57 million accounts were compromised.Imgur was also recognized for the speed?of its disclosure. It said it only became aware of the hack on November 23, and by the morning of November 24 it had begun notifying impacted users (via their registered email address) and forcing password resets. It also released a blog post that same day."
148,Apps,"An app masquerading as?MyEtherWallet.com, one of the internet¡¯s most popular services for storing ETH and other crypto coins, has made its way to the top of the iOS App Store charts.The app rose to the number three spot in Finance category of the App Store this weekend as part of a bitcoin frenzy that saw exchange Coinbase top Apple¡¯s free download list in the U.S. In this case, however, it is important to note this app is not official so users should avoid downloading it.The app developer ? who is listed as Nam Le ? has three other apps with Apple, including two panda fighting games, but no history of crypto or bitcoin services.The creators of MyEtherWallet said in a tweet that they have contacted Apple in a bid to have the app removed.We¡¯ve reached out to Apple to get an idea how it made it through all of the standard safety checks, and to ask whether it will remain in the App Store.This is NOT US. We have file reports and emailed and reported. Would appreciate the communities assistance in getting these scamtards out of our lives.PS: We are #Foss4Lyfe https://t.co/SmI8cqNvxA? MyEtherWallet.com (@myetherwallet) December 10, 2017The iOS app costs $4.99 and it first landed on the App Store just over a week ago. It?allows users to create or import a wallet to store cryptocurrencies independently of an exchange.The app notes claim all keys are stored on device, but nevertheless granting an unknown developer?full trust of wallet information, be it importing an existing wallet or creating a new one, is certainly ill-advised.A crypto wallet consists of a public address where money is sent to, that¡¯s shareable, and?a private key that grants the wallet owner access ? that should never be shared and should be kept securely. Wallets are popular with cryptocurrency owners because they ensure that an exchange doesn¡¯t own your coins and, as the case of the explosion of one-time bitcoin darling Mt. Gox shows, you get to keep hold of your money even if all goes wrong at the exchange.Threats aside, the app is also highly unethical/illegal. The?developer is monetizing free and open-source software (FOSS),?as MyEtherWallet pointed out on Twitter.It isn¡¯t clear how many downloads the app has gotten, but notes from the most recent update are thankful for users¡¯ ¡°early feedbacks.¡± Tracking service?Apptopia told TechCrunch that it estimates that the app has seen around 3,000 downloads so far.Apple¡¯s App Store vetting process is notably more rigorous than much of the competition, so it¡¯s curious that the service not only skyrocketed up the charts, but has also secured an ad on the store. The episode?is another sign of just how mainstream bitcoin and crypto has become. In this case, Apple may not be aware of what exactly it has allowed into its App Store.The irony of Apple allowing a crypto knockoff app into the App Store won¡¯t be lost on regular watchers who will recall that the U.S. firm has removed all VPN apps?from China this year at the behest of the government. VPNs, which are crucial for helping those in censored countries access a free internet, were among the 600-plus apps that Apple itself said it has removed from Chinese version of the App Store in 2017.Update: The app appears to no longer be live in the iOS app store as of 1PM ET."
149,Apps,"Google is about to launch a small but useful update to Google Maps that will give you live guidance and interactive real-time notifications during your journey.The idea here is to give you real-time updates while you are on your transit journey. These updates will appear in the Google Maps app and, maybe most importantly, on your Android lock screen.Update: this is now live and available for both iOS and Android.To get started, you search for your transit directions in Google Maps as usual. So far, so good. What¡¯s new here is that you¡¯ll soon be able to tap a ¡°start¡± button at the bottom the screen with the details about your transit journey and then get live updates as you walk or ride on your local buses and trains.Our understanding is that Google Maps will even remind you to get off your bus or train when you get close to your stop. That¡¯s definitely useful when you¡¯re traveling somewhere new (or sleepy).The notifications on the lock screen are also new. One nifty feature here is that they are interactive, so you can scroll right through your journey¡¯s steps.While Google Maps always did a good job of giving you detailed transit directions (though it¡¯s often nowhere as good and useful as CityMapper¡¯s more detailed directions), the process generally involved keeping track of your own progress along the route. With this update, transit notifications become a bit more like using Maps for walking, biking and driving.We expect this update to go live soon ? and Google may already be testing it outside of its trusted tester community. If you¡¯re already seeing it in Google Maps yourself, let us know in the comments.??"
150,Apps,"Update: this story has now been confirmed.As Spotify continues to inch towards a public listing, Apple is making a move of its own to step up its game in music services. Sources tell us that the company is close to acquiring Shazam, the popular app that lets people identify any song, TV show, film or advert in seconds, by listening to an audio clip or (in the case of, say, an ad) a visual fragment, and then takes you to content relevant to that search.We have heard that the deal is being signed this week, and will be announced on Monday, although that could always change.One source describes the deal as in the nine figures; another puts it at around ?300 million ($401 million). We are still asking around. Notably, though, the numbers we¡¯ve heard are lower than the $1.02 billion (according to PitchBook) post-money valuation the company had in its last funding round, in 2015.In all, Shazam has raised $143.5 million from investors that include Kleiner Perkins, London¡¯s DN Capital, IVP and strategic investors Sony Music, Universal Music and Access Industries (which owns Warner Music). Kleiner Perkins also invested in competitor SoundHound.Shazam last noted that it passed 1 billion downloads, but that was back in September 2016, meaning those numbers are likely higher now.But in the world of apps, high numbers do not always translate into profits: In September 2017,?Shazam reportedly?made ?40.3 million ($54 million) in revenues in its 2016 fiscal year, which was a turnaround from the declines between FY 2014 and 2015. It made a statutory pre-tax loss of ?4 million ($5.3 million) in 2016, which was still a loss but significantly smaller than the ?16.6 million loss in FY 2015.The company¡¯s CEO Rich Riley noted earlier this year, however, that operating at or near profitability is the intention as it¡¯s been growing; and he also hinted that the company was, as a result, likely an acquisition target.Shazam launched way back in 1999, well before the days of apps, as a service you reached by way of a SMS code ? in fact, its first name was 2580, after the number you typed in the UK to access the service.Since those early days, it¡¯s launched a number of related services. Artists on Shazam lets you follow famous people and see what music they are Shazamming.Its augmented reality brand marketing service lets you discover content based on pictures that you snap with the app.?¡°You came for music, stay to experience McDonald¡¯s Karaoke, MTN Dew VR Racing and much more,¡± is the company¡¯s pitch on this feature.It also integrates with other apps like Snapchat and Apple¡¯s Siri, and it?currently sends lots of traffic to other music apps like Spotify and Apple Music, which pays it when those clicks convert to purchases.It¡¯s not clear what will carry on post acquisition, and which of these might be something that Apple would integrate into its own business (and how), but it¡¯s notable that much of what Shazam does is very synergistic?with what Apple is working on already: AR, and more features to attract more users to the Apple Music platform.Apple has made dozens of other acquisitions, and one of the biggest has been in the area of music: it acquired Beats for $3 billion in 2014, which became the basis for Apple Music. That service has around 30 million users as of September of this year. As a point of comparison, Spotify has over 60 million paying subscribers, with 140 million overall.We¡¯ve reached out to Shazam and Apple for comment."
151,Apps,"FMany companies have recently been given a January 1, 2018 deadline, after which point any new apps they submit will be rejected by the App Store Review team, they¡¯ve been told by Apple. In the meantime, some have been able to maintain their existing apps, but it¡¯s unclear how long that will last.Example of Apple¡¯s App Store rejection notices for rule 4.2.6.Example of Apple¡¯s App Store rejection notices for rule 4.3.What¡¯s unfortunate about the expanded policy enforcement is that these app makers specifically target the small business market. They build apps for businesses that don¡¯t have the internal resources to build their own apps or can¡¯t afford to hire a custom shop to design a new iOS app from scratch.Instead, these companies help small businesses like local retailers, restaurants, small fitness studios, nonprofits, churches and other organizations to create an app presence using templates, drag-and-drop wizards and various tools to put together a more basic app that can then be customized further with their own branding and images.These may not be the most-used apps, to be sure, but for the niche audiences they serve ? say, for example, customers of a local pizza place that would rather have its own app rather than paying the fees associated with being on a food ordering platform like Seamless/GrubHub or Uber Eats ? they serve a useful purpose.As one app builder put it, the decision to limit these small businesses¡¯ ability to compete on the App Store is as if a web hosting company said that they would no longer allow web pages built with WordPress templates or those made using website wizards from services like Wix or Squarespace.Apple¡¯s move, which appears to be blocking a large number of small businesses from the App Store, has now caught the attention of Congress.In a letter dated December 1, 2017, Congressman Ted W. Lieu (33rd District, California) has asked Apple to reconsider its expanded enforcement of its 4.2.6 and 4.3 guidelines. The former bans the template-based apps while the latter is more of a catch-all for banning spam ? a rule Apple is now using if it can¡¯t prove that the app was built using some sort of wizard or drag-and-drop system.¡°Recently, I was informed that Apple¡¯s decision to more stringently enforce its policy guidelines regarding design and functionality may result in the wholesale rejection of template-based apps from the App Store,¡± wrote Lieu. ¡°It is my understanding that many small businesses, research organizations, and religious institutions rely on template apps when they do not possess the resources to develop apps in-house.¡±The Congressman suggests that Apple is now casting ¡°too wide a net¡± in its effort to remove spam and illegitimate apps from the App Store, and is ¡°invalidating apps from longstanding and legitimate developers who pose no threat to the App Store¡¯s integrity.¡±Above: Rep. Ted W. Lieu¡¯s letter to AppleThe expansion of the policy has had a dampening effect on the industry that serves these smaller businesses.One company, Shoutem, already shut down as a result, for instance. (Only a small team remains to support current customers.)Explained Shoutem CEO Viktor Marohic, the company closed up shop a few weeks ago ? a decision he attributes to the change to the App Store guidelines, combined with the challenges of operating a business in this space.¡°The?4.2.6 was just a final drop that made us move on a bit faster with that decision [to close],¡± he said of Shoutem¡¯s closure. ¡°It was also a threat to our enterprise business, since it is hard to predict what Apple might do next. While we understand their intentions, the general approach that they took turned out to be quite unfair to our enterprise customers that actually built fully custom apps on top of our platform and do not share much of the code with other apps built on the platform,¡± said Marohic.Another company affected by the rule is ChowNow, which designs apps for restaurants using components that allow them to have their own online ordering systems and loyalty programs.ChowNow used to be an Apple favorite. In fact, the company was even quoted in Apple¡¯s documentation regarding best practices for Apple Pay because it was one of the first companies to integrate Apple¡¯s payments technology into its app-building platform.But even ChowNow is being told by Apple that after January 1, things will change for them.?Above: How different can restaurant apps really be? Big brands vs. ChowNow (right)?¡°There was no way in June [when the guidelines changed] that we would have said, ¡®that¡¯s going to target our apps,'¡± ChowNow CEO?Christopher Webb told TechCrunch of how he first reacted to the news. ¡°Apple had told us you aren¡¯t being targeted by this from a quality standpoint. So being hit now under the umbrella of spam is shocking to every quality developer out there and all the good actors.¡±Apple¡¯s concern over template-based apps for restaurants, Webb added, also doesn¡¯t make sense because ¡°there¡¯s only so much you can do with apps that perform the same utility ? ordering food.¡±Pizza apps, for example, will all tend to have photos of pizza, use red in their designs, and offer buttons for pickup and delivery.In addition, ChowNow¡¯s apps use 100 percent native code, while big brands like Pizza Hut and Domino¡¯s contain web views.Apple hasn¡¯t sent out any large-scale communication to its developer community about the expanded enforcement of its rules. Instead, all conversations it¡¯s having are one-on-ones with individual businesses. This allows it to more selectively curate its own list of ¡°winners and losers¡± in terms of which companies will be targeted by the changes.Not surprisingly, Apple¡¯s?partnership with IBM, which involves IBM building template-based apps for enterprise clients, is not impacted by the new rules.The irony with regard to this situation is that Apple has taken a strong position on net neutrality, arguing that all businesses have the right to an open internet. Wrote?Apple¡¯s U.S. Vice President for Public Policy Cynthia Hogan in a letter to the FCC this August:Broadband providers should not block, throttle, or otherwise discriminate against lawful websites and services. Far from new, this has been a foundational principle of the FCC¡¯s approach to net neutrality for over a decade. Providers of online goods and services need assurance that they will be able to reliably reach their customers without interference from the underlying broadband provider.?However, what Apple¡¯s doing with its expanded ban of templated apps is the equivalent of preventing small businesses from being able to compete in the same ecosystem as the bigger brands. It¡¯s the gatekeeper effectively creating a system that impacts the little guy by interfering with their ability to do business on the web ? a web we increasingly access through native apps, not a browser.According to 2017?data from Flurry, mobile browser usage dropped from 20 percent in 2013 to just 8 percent in 2016, with the rest of our time spent in apps, for example. They are our doorway to the web and the way we interact with services.¡°Rule 4.2.6 is a concrete illustration of the danger of Apple¡¯s dominant position,¡± lamented?J?r?me Granados, of Goodbarber ? a company that had fortunately invested in progressive web apps ahead of Apple¡¯s changes. ¡°This rule prevents many local newspapers, online media, NGOs, religious communities, sports clubs, local stores, schools, universities, local public administrations, and other actors with limited means, to count among their audience iPhone users,¡± he told TechCrunch.Among these businesses¡¯ frustrations is the fact that an App Store cleanup didn¡¯t have to involve the wholesale removal of small businesses¡¯ apps. Apple could have just unlisted apps from category pages to reduce the ¡°clutter,¡± or only returned the apps in search results when customers type in more exactly matching names.¡°We understand the need to clean up the App Store, but we feel Apple could have gone about it in a different way,¡± noted?Bizness Apps CEO Andrew Gazdecki, who is transitioning his clients to progressive web apps, per Apple¡¯s advice.¡°We¡¯re concerned that this rejection notice is problematic because what¡¯s being called into question isn¡¯t the quality of the app, but rather the way in which it¡¯s generated,¡± Gazdecki said. The CEO yesterday?set up a Change.org petition?to plead with Apple to change its mind. Over 250 signatures have been added, as of the time of writing.¡°They¡¯ve?wiped out pretty much an entire industry. Not just DIY tools like AppMakr, but also development suites like Titanium,¡± said Jay Shapiro, CEO of AppMakr, which now builds apps for international markets where Android dominates. (Titanium claims it¡¯s not affected).Above: The original version of the Official Lumineers app, built by AppMakrWe¡¯ve also heard from one source that the change will affect other companies building apps, including MindBody (apps for fitness studios), eChurch and Custom Church Apps (apps for churches), Olo (apps for restaurants), Hopscotch (games), uCampaign (apps for Republican lawmakers) and others. [Hearing that Hopscotch may not be affected; others haven¡¯t commented.]¡°I¡¯m sure that Apple has some business rationale for doing this, but they have just disenfranchised an entire ecosystem and none of us can really understand why,¡± Shapiro said. ¡°There were much easier ways to fix their perceived problem.¡±Apple has not responded to requests for comment."
152,Apps,"The right soundtrack can make a boring video interesting. So after years of reported discussions with the record labels, Facebook is launching?video editing tool Sound Collection for inserting into Facebook and Instagram clips ¡°songs, vocals, noises, and instrumental tracks spanning genres like hip hop, pop, jazz, country, and more.¡± What you can¡¯t add is any music you¡¯ve heard before. Sound Collection has huge potential, but lackluster execution, and probably won¡¯t deter users from illegally adding popular music to their videos.Sound Collection comes alongside a slew of other new resources for video makers following the launch of Facebook¡¯s ¡°Creator¡± app last month that caters to web influencers. They include a new hub with educational materials related to 360 media production, a 360 camera loaner program and a page featuring tools for 360 video editing. The goal with the launches is to help video creators build and grow on Facebook, the company says.With the Facebook Sound Collection (rolling out to everyone here over the next few days), creators can access a free set of high-quality audio tracks and sound effects they can use in their videos on Facebook and Instagram, without having to worry with copyright or payment. That¡¯s because Facebook has bought the rights from composers and songwriters. Facebook says more tracks and effects will be added in the future as the collection grows. It seems a bit like the Vine Soundboard feature the now-defunct video app offered for pasting in sound effects.Video creators using the service also can take advantage of new discovery tools that allow them to learn about the different artists, follow those they like and browse the sounds by genre, mood, length and vocals. Some of the debut tracks include those from artists like singer-songwriter Kiri Tse, Indian percussionist?Jim Santi Owen and guitarist and film composer?Lyle Workman.Those are far from Top 40 artists. The New York Times reported earlier this year that Facebook has been in talks with the major record labels since at least 2015. Right now, it¡¯s forced to block or take down videos that it detects using popular copyrighted music. So if you slapped Dad¡¯s favorite Bob Dylan song on that 60th birthday vacation montage you made in iMovie, it could get removed from Facebook. The social network has been hoping for a better solution.Apparently it hasn¡¯t reached such an agreement yet, as the current crop of artists aren¡¯t well-known. Lyle Workman did an acoustic cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival¡¯s ¡°Fortunate Son¡± that he recorded for TV show Sons of Anarchy. That¡¯s about as close to popular as Sound Collection¡¯s artists gets right now.But if Facebook pays up for some big-name music as soundtrack options, it could see more viewership for the videos it already uploads and entice creation of more. TechCrunch has been griping about Facebook¡¯s bare-bones video editor since 2013, and 18 months ago begged for improvements to the embarrassingly outdated feature, including a soundtracking option.¡°This update begins to solve a problem I¡¯ve heard from creators ? they love making and sharing videos on Facebook and Instagram, but it can often be difficult to find audio or sounds to include,¡± writes Facebook¡¯s head of video Fidji Simo. Hopefully Facebook is serious about investing in Sound Collection so you don¡¯t have to turn to third-party editing apps or get slapped for copyright infringement.Meanwhile, the new 360 Community page launching today is offering a suite of tools for those creating 360 degree videos for Facebook. Since launching back in 2015, Facebook says more than a million 360 videos have been shared on its platform. But creating these videos has not been easy, because it requires special equipment, and a host of other challenges.The page includes a variety of resources, like tutorials on topics like getting started with 360 cameras, 360 video editing workflows and an introduction to spatial audio. Facebook also plans to hold 360 community meetups so creators can collaborate.Facebook is launching 360 Director for Pages and profiles so they can add text and graphic annotations to videos, and guide where people should look with a default view that can move around as people watch if they don¡¯t scroll themselves. It¡¯s expanding Player Controls for choosing the zoom, direction and preview thumbnail so user profiles can make these adjustments, not just Pages. And you can save drafts for later if you make changes before you upload.Creators can borrow a ZCam S1 for freeThe new Community page also aims to address problems by giving creators the ability to borrow from Blend Media 360 cameras for their upcoming projects and experiments. Initially, loaners include the GoPro Fusion and ZCam S1, and other cameras will be added in the coming months. It¡¯s free for creators to borrow a camera, Facebook tells us, but the kicker is that it asks that some of the content created with the loaner gear gets shared to Facebook.Since 2012, YouTube has offered ¡°YouTube Spaces,¡± where creators can come use high-quality equipment to shoot video for the platform. Facebook now lending out its own hardware is another sign that it truly does want to challenge YouTube, not just with random clips you stumble across in News Feed, but with premium content like its new Watch tab of original programming. But to attract the best creators, Facebook needs to prove it can pay out enough to earn their time. That¡¯s still a work in progress."
153,Apps,"¡°We plan on making Bitmoji obsolete,¡± says Akash Nigam, CEO of Genies. Bragging about beating one of the world¡¯s top apps before his has even launched is emblematic of Nigam¡¯s and Genies¡¯ brash style. But with $15 million in funding at a valuation over $100 million, top investors like NEA and Hollywood royalty like CAA are buying into the avatar startup. It already has 680,000 kids waitlisted to sign up for the Genies iOS app?that launches today.¡°If, God forbid, Donald Trump bombs North Korea, you¡¯ll see your Genie riding a nuke to North Korea,¡± says Nigam. Whether that idea makes you giggle or roll your eyes, this is Genies¡¯ plan ¡°to be the next BuzzFeed,¡± the 24-year-old CEO tells me. ¡°Your Genie is the star of the show. The script is whatever happens in the world that day.¡±It all starts with customizing your big-headed, photorealistic Genie avatar. While Snapchat-owned?Bitmoji look like a comic strip, Genies are closer to Pixar. First you¡¯ll select a personality type that determines some of the scenes you¡¯ll see, based on clouds of brands like Coachella, BuzzFeed and Supreme for cool kids, or TechCrunch and the BBC for techies. Then, using the Genies trait selector wheels, you can quickly scrub through tons of options for a dozen characteristics, like face shape, hair and eyes. Finally, you¡¯ll outfit your Genie in clothes ranging from generic shirts to popular brands.Genies sends you 10 to 15 animated scenes throughout each day that are around 10 seconds long and feature your avatar. They include quirky little situations for holidays like Christmas, cultural staples like hungover-Sundays and ones based on the top daily news for your personality type. Human editors review the scenes for factual accuracy, coherence and humor, and can tweak them before they¡¯re sent out. Typically, new scenes will arrive quietly in the Genies app, with notifications reserved for huge breaking news or?batched digests of updates.Nigam says Genies taps more than 1 million sources with a focus on reputable news outlets to figure out what¡¯s trending as early as possible. He claims that Genies¡¯ art team and AI have built millions of pre-designed creative assets, and that the AI can actually piece them together to automatically create the animated scenes. If all the blogs are reporting Elon Musk¡¯s plan to colonize mars, then it will cobble together space, stars and Elon himself to show your Genie rocketing to the Red Planet alongside the headline.You can swipe up to read the top source article for the news. But what Genies really encourages is you messaging the video scenes to friends via other apps like Instagram Direct, Facebook Messenger or Snapchat. ¡°Everyone has Giphy, but they use it everywhere else. Exact same thing with us,¡± Nigam tells me.The idea is to leverage vanity to make the news seem interesting and shareable, and deliver it through a social app instead of a traditional media publisher. ¡°At our age, we get the majority of our news from Twitter, Snapchat or Instagram.¡± And for added virality and personalization, many scenes include an empty silhouette you can fill with a celebrity of your choice, like Trump or Kylie Jenner, or insert a friend so you act out the scene with your buddy. If Facebook taught us anything, it¡¯s that people will always open a notification if they get tagged in an image.Overall, the Genies look great, with much more nuance than you see in alternatives with either fewer customization options or that rely on facial detection. Nigam says he¡¯s not a believer in technologies for automatic avatar generation, saying that even small inaccuracies can be jarring, and testers enjoyed the personalization process. If Genies just released an emoji keyboard with the avatars so you could use them anywhere, it could prove popular.But the animated scenes are often gimmicky, crass or even offensive. Over a few days of testing, I saw ones advocating for beer bonging, pot brownies, study drugs like Adderall and pouring crappy vodka into Grey Goose bottles to save money. Nigam defended the content, saying these were ¡°party-oriented¡± for a ¡°young demo where they share and learn through the lens of pop culture.¡± Others like ¡°Wanted: Holiday Bang Buddy¡± might be too lewd even for college kids. And one even parodied the important NFL protests of racism and police brutality, featuring students ¡°taking a knee¡± to get out of a pop quiz. That should never have made it past the human editors.Those that weren¡¯t worrisome often felt mediocre, like showing two avatars building a sandcastle to represent an article about Facebook launching the Messenger Kids app. Your Genie runs across the screen dropping bitcoin before someone bursts the bubble in one of today¡¯s scenes. Perhaps the best one I saw was a mock-up for what Genies could have sent after the Las Vegas mass shooting tragedy that encouraged people to read a Newsweek article about how to give blood.As a social app, the avatars are too contorted into specific situations for general use, and as a news reader, it feels haphazard and inefficient. The team has a powerful idea, and the graphics are pretty, but the execution on the content needs work.¡°We did a bunch of apps, and they sucked,¡± Nigam says about previous products his team built before Genies. ¡°We¡¯d think they were gonna blow up and there¡¯d be 16 users.¡± Born and raised in Silicon Valley¡¯s Mountain View, Nigam is the kind of guy who¡¯s been dreaming of launching his own app since he was old enough to be allowed to use them.Genies co-founder and CEO Akash NigamHe met his co-founders during hackathons while studying computer science at University of Michigan. They raised a seed round and built a failed group chat app called Blend while working out of a tiny room attached to a mosque in San Jose. They had a weak exit opportunity for Blend and turned it down. Seeing Bitmoji hover around App Store No. 1 for years convinced them there were greater riches in the avatar space.Now they¡¯ve pivoted Blend into Genies with $15 million over a few rounds of funding from traditional investors like NEA, Foundation Capital, Box Group, Great Oaks, Lerer Ventures and Trinity Ventures. The entertainment industry was also hot to trot, with backing coming from CAA Ventures, production company Management 360, Prizeo/Represent¡¯s Bobby Maylack and former Legendary Pictures CEO Thomas Tull. And strategic celebrities are also funding the startup, including NBA star?Russell Westbrook, the football great Joe Montana, musician Shawn Mendes and former Vine stars Cameron Dallas and Jake Paul.They see plenty of revenue opportunities in Genies, which could easily do product placement and sponsored content in its animated scenes. ¡°Your Genie doing a Gatorade shower,¡± Nigam suggests. ¡°We can monetize any time we want to turn on the spigot.¡±?The startup also plans to let you buy the clothes you put on your Genie, or even get your avatar plastered on custom merchandise. ¡°Brands get really fascinated by the wheels. We could do an entire Supreme wheel,¡± he explains, referring to the trendy urban fashion wear line.Now the company has Silicon Valley and LA offices, plus engineering in Bucharest. ¡°We take kids from the streets into our office every day for testing,¡± says, noting San Francisco doesn¡¯t always know what¡¯s hip. The startup spent the summer on an aggressive college marketing campaign, with tons of scantily clad models wearing Genies merchandise and signs asking the company to ¡°Make My Genie.¡± All those waitlist sign-ups could help it score some traction today.When asked about what he¡¯d do if Snapchat¡¯s Bitmoji started acting out the news too, Nigam fired back that they¡¯d ¡°force you to live inside Snapchat itself¡± rather than share elsewhere. And just to dig the dagger a bit deeper, he said, ¡°They¡¯re a trend that may have already reached its peak.¡±Perhaps I¡¯m showing my age by being put off by some of? the content. Nigam boldly states ¡°We don¡¯t really trust people in product unless they¡¯re actively talking to teens all the time.¡± But being a news publisher, even one that looks nothing like the rest, can be more complicated than it seems. Snapchat has had to go to great lengths to teach news outlets how to make Discover channels for Gen Z. And Facebook is reckoning with how much damage can be done with fake news.Genies has a ton of potential. The idea of a mini-you visually depicting the news is fun, and piggybacking on other messaging apps instead of trying to build another feed is wise. Still, the content feels rushed and half-baked at times, and could either fail to entice users or be too thin to persist as more than a fad. It has plenty of money and connections to find the talent necessary to improve the scenes, though. And if the avatars become something everyone wants, that could be enough in the meantime."

The bug, which was initially spotted by 9to5Mac, reportedly made it possible for an outside party to access things like smart locks and garage doors.The company has since confirmed with TechCrunch the existence of the bug. ¡°The issue affecting HomeKit users running iOS 11.2 has been fixed,¡± an Apple spokesperson said in a statement. ¡°The fix temporarily disables remote access to shared users, which will be restored in a software update early next week.¡± The fix appears to be a server-side update, meaning that the end-user doesn¡¯t have to update anything for it to take effect. For the time being, it also means that users with 11.2? won¡¯t have all of the standard remote HomeKit functionality, until Apple rolls out something more permanent next week. Getting that functionality back will require updating to the latest version of iOS.

157,Apps,"Last November, Facebook launched Instant Games, a new platform for gaming with friends inside the Messenger chat app. Today, the company is announcing a couple of notable new features for this gaming platform, including support for live streaming via Facebook Live and video chatting with fellow gamers.The idea with Instant Games is to boost people¡¯s time spent in Messenger by giving them something else to do besides just chat.It also serves as Facebook¡¯s newest attempt to return to dominance in social gaming. The company¡¯s gaming platform years ago had earned a peak of a quarter-billion dollars per quarter on its 30 percent tax on in-game purchases, and it leveraged Facebook¡¯s network effects to help games go viral.But with the shift to mobile, Facebook¡¯s position in gaming declined. These days, people spend more time gaming in native mobile apps built for iOS and Android devices.When Instant Games first launched it offered 20 games across 30 markets, including titles like Pac-Man, Space Invaders, and Words With Friends Frenzy. Now that number has grown to over 70 games from more than 100 developers worldwide, the company says, including recently launched Tetris.It will soon add other big names, like Angry Birds (built by CoolGames, who also built Tetris);?Sonic Jump from SEGA;?Disney Tsum Tsum, published by LINE; and a new game from Puzzle & Dragons maker,?GungHo Online Entertainment, Inc.To mark its one-year anniversary, Facebook is also debuting a couple of new features for its Instant Games: live streaming and video chat.Live streaming begins rolling out today.The feature, powered by Facebook Live, lets Messenger users broadcast their gameplay to their Facebook Page or profile. To use live streaming, you just tap on the new camera icon at the top right of the screen while gaming, then add a short description to be shared alongside your post. To start recording, you press the ¡°Start Live Video¡± button.The live broadcast is then shared to your Page or profile. When it ends, friends and fans can watch the saved recording.With the live streaming feature, Facebook is playing catch up rivals like Twitch, YouTube and Microsoft, all of which today offer their own tools and services for live streaming games. However, in Facebook¡¯s case, the addition is more casual ? it¡¯s more about sharing with friends, not monetizing a community through subscriptions, game sales, or custom chat icons, as you¡¯d find on Twitch or YouTube, for example. (At least, not yet).Facebook says it will soon start testing a feature that lets users video chat while gaming, as well. The feature will initially debut next year in Zynga¡¯s Words with Friends, before expanding to other titles.According to the company, over 245 million people video chat every month on Messenger. That makes for a large potential audience for a video chatting feature, which adds interactive element to the gaming experience. The feature will also challenge other popular video chatting and hangout apps popular with teens and young adults, like Fam, the app for group video chat via iMessage, for example, or Microsoft¡¯s Skype, among others.As part of today¡¯s news, Facebook shared a few stats from its gaming partners.

158,Apps,"Pinterest today said it is hiring a new head of corporate and business development, bringing on former Facebooker Gary Johnson as it looks to continue to expand.The hiring comes at a time when Pinterest recently saw its president, Tim Kendall, depart to start his own company. As Pinterest looks to ramp up its pitch to advertisers, it needs to bring on people who can deal?with potential partners ? as well as ones that can scout out new business opportunities that Pinterest can expand (or acquire its way) into. That¡¯s going to be critical as the company positions itself as a company proficient in visual search and to break out of experimental advertising budgets.Johnson was most recently Facebook¡¯s director of corporate development, and prior to that worked at Credit Suisse and Apple in a number of operating and development roles. With a history as a VP at Credit Suisse, and corporate development at Facebook, Johnson is going to bring in a lot of experience to the company that is looking to grow internationally and continues to sell itself as a potential primary advertising product. That means dealing with a new slate of partners ? which may have different needs or demands ? abroad and trying to identify spots on Pinterest that make sense for expansion.Pinterest has been somewhat acquisitive, though there hasn¡¯t been anything particularly splashy (outside of Jelly, which may seem like more of a name than anything). It has acquired a number of teams, like the ones behind Highlight and Shorts, and also last year picked up Instapaper, which continues to live on in the App Store. But its new sweet spot where it wants to expand, visual search, can find some of its origins in the acquisition of VisualGraph back in 2014.Pinterest is flush with some additional funding, having raised an additional $150 million earlier this year at a $12.3 billion valuation. The company now has more than 200 million users, and as it looks to build more products, like its camera search product Lens, it has to come up with a unique way to tell its story to potential partners that differs from Facebook or Google ? which continue to dominate the awareness and intent slots of the online advertisement ecosystem."
159,Apps,"Instagram has changed a lot since its acquisition by Facebook in 2012.The original premise was so simple. Beautify your photo and share it to your friends in a couple clicks. Like your friends photos with a simple scroll and a double-tap.Now, Instagram has videos and gifs (Boomerang). It has its own set of superstars and an algorithmic feed that helps those superstars dominate users¡¯ feeds, including mine. And it has a direct messaging system.Today, Instagram is testing out yet another change with the launch of a standalone Instagram Direct app. For now, the app is only available in Uruguay, Chile, Turkey, Italy, Portugal and Israel.The Verge first noticed the test.Instagram had this to say on the test:We want Instagram to be a place for all of your moments, and private sharing with close friends is a big part of that. To make it easier and more fun for people to connect in this way, we are beginning to test Direct ? a camera-first app that connects seamlessly back to Instagram.The app will let you create and share stories, and give you access to exclusive filters, Boomerang and other creative tools on Instagram. And, of course, your Instagram friends are added instantly to the Instagram Direct app.This begs the question: Why build a separate app for stuff that¡¯s already available and functional within Instagram? The most obvious answer is that this is yet another barrage in the Instagram¡¯s assault on Snapchat.And it¡¯s been working. In January, TechCrunch reported that the launch of Instagram Stories had resulted in lower usage of Snapchat Stories. The launch of Instagram Direct, with its perception of more private and intimate one-to-one conversations, could feasibly have the same effect on Snapchat¡¯s direct messaging.There¡¯s also the question of Messenger. Facebook is clearly making a play to get younger users back on the Facebook platform with the launch of Facebook Messenger Kids. The launch of Instagram Direct may be another part of that strategy.The only specifics we have, if you can even call them specifics, is that the app will launch globally next year after Instagram has worked out the bugs and responded to user feedback."
160,Apps,"Brave, the blockchain-based browser initiative that raised $35 million in an ICO earlier this year, is making its first major move to build an ecosystem that rewards publishers in a new kind of way.One of the selling points of Brave is that it uses its token (BAT, Basic Attention Token) to disrupt the current financial norms of online publishing. The company wants to reward users for browsing the web, while also helping to make advertising less intrusive and more relevant. In another important focus, it wants to use BAT to let readers reward content makers whose websites they visit.That¡¯s where its new push this week is focused on. Brave is giving its users a total of 300,000 BAT tokens ? worth around $60,000 ? over the next 30 days. Users typically earn tokens by using Brave, but this promotion will put additional credit in there, which can then be given directly to publishers or YouTube channel operators.That¡¯s a fairly major move given that Brave claims to have one million monthly users and, on the publisher side, over 1,100 websites and 600 YouTube channels as content partners. YouTube was added to the platform last month.A notification offering the token pushUsers will get a maximum of $5 in BAT over the next 30 days ? or until the token allocated is reached ? which will be added to their Brave payment wallet. That wallet can be used to ¡®tip¡¯ websites that they visit based on time spent on the site.The default, for example, allocates the total tip jar based on the percentage of time that a Brave user has spent on Brave-verified websites and YouTube channels. It can be overridden, however, to allow a user to tip whatever they like to whichever website they like.Brave Payments¡¯?default distributes a users¡¯ wallet based on time spent on Brave-verified websitesIn effect, Brave is boosting the wallets of its users with this offer giving them greater potential to tip their favorite content creators, who can convert the BAT into fiat currency.¡°It is one of many steps toward dealing users back in for a fair deal, and dealing out the toxic middle players,¡± Brave CEO Brendan Eich, who was formerly in charge of Mozilla, told TechCrunch in a statement.¡°We are moving from good-will contributions to user grants to private ads that share the bulk of the gross ad revenue with the user, without any targeting or tracking by remote parties (including Brave),¡± he added.Unlike many other ICO projects, Brave has a product in the market in the form of its browser. The full scope of the project will take some time to roll out, however, with payment options and YouTube added over the last two months, for example. But it is certainly at a more advanced stage than the majority of projects that have raised funding via a token sale.Prior to its ICO, Brave had raised $6 million in traditional venture capital funding."
161,Apps,"Firefox¡¯s default search engine has become the subject of a hotly contested legal battle, a few weeks after Mozilla announced it would be moving from Yahoo to Google. Yahoo¡¯s new parent Oath filed a complaint against Mozilla in a California court on December 1, alleging a breach of contract. Now Mozilla has filed a counter complaint, stating that the switch back was in line with a deal struck between the two companies.??Sounds like a small thing, sure, but we¡¯re talking hundreds of millions of dollars here. Back in 2014, Yahoo struck a deal that would make its search engine the default for Mozilla¡¯s popular, if struggling, browser, to the tune of $375 million a year. Details of the deal were only made public last year, as CEO Marissa Mayer¡¯s time at the company came under the microscope while it prepared to sell itself to Verizon. For its many faults, the Verizon deal went through, of course, forming Oath in the process (the Yahoo/AOL hybrid under which TechCrunch resides). Along with it, Verizon inherited an annual payment of $375 million through 2019. Not a bad deal for Mozilla, especially when one considers this little gem: Yahoo (or whoever owns Yahoo) is obligated to continue payments, even if Mozilla were to, say, drop the search engine as its default. Mozilla was given a contractual right to terminate the agreement, if Yahoo was found unacceptable for some reason. That precise thing occurred just a few weeks back, as the company launched its new Quantum browser, switching back to Google in the process. The latest version of Firefox has been warmly regarded by many as a return to form for a company that had previously been lost in the woods, rapidly losing marketshare to Chrome in the process.

That¡¯s to say that it showcases ¡®featured snippets¡¯ which give a summary of topics, related content to search results, and suggested topics. There¡¯s also support for trending searches, and you can use voice inputs for search, too.The app follows the introduction of data-saving app Datally, storage app Files Go and the expansion of YouTube Go, all of which are aimed at making Google and its services for relevant to users in emerging markets. Beyond apps, it is also preparing to ship a ¡®Go¡¯ version of Android."
163,Apps,"When it announced the new Surface Pro a few months back, Microsoft also used the opportunity to preview Whiteboard, a Windows 10 app designed to offer creative and business collaboration across devices. Since then, the app¡¯s only been available as a private beta, but starting today, Microsoft¡¯s offering it up as a public beta for anyone with a Windows 10 device. Whiteboard is a compelling little app. It¡¯s sort of a digital sibling to Microsoft¡¯s pricey Surface Hub. The app will start rolling out to Windows 10 over the course of the next 24 hours, bringing the ability to essentially brainstorm, ideate, iterate and all of those other fun work things in real time across multiple devices running the same operating system.The app uses a swap or a pen input, turning objects into standardized shapes in order to create tables, flowcharts, diagrams and the like; autosaving work to the cloud, others can pick up where you¡¯ve left off. It looks like a pretty compelling app, and one that straddles the line between Microsoft¡¯s traditional work focus and its current push to recruit more creative types through its Surface line of products.Of course, these sort of work apps are really tough to get right, even with all of the advances to cloud-based collaborative over the past few years. Multi-device collaboration does require at least one person have an Office 360 subscription.?Whiteboard is out of beta, but still in preview, so it¡¯s not quite the final version. Microsoft¡¯s still soliciting feedback, including feature requests through the app.No word on whether or when the app might be coming to additional operating systems, but given Microsoft¡¯s mobile strategy of late, I wouldn¡¯t be too shocked to see it arrive on Android and iOS devices in the not too distant future."
164,Apps,"Foursquare¡¯s VP of business development Mike Harkey, who has been with the company for more than five years, has left to join Google as its director of global product partnerships.His LinkedIn page shows that he joined Google this month after serving a lengthy tenure at Foursquare, which has seen a significant shift from an early darling as a check-in product to one with a robust enterprise business and location data set. Foursquare now has products like City Guide, which provide a wide array of tips, locations and other information for venues in different cities.¡°[Harkey] moved on to a role at Google after 5 terrific years with Foursquare,¡± the company said. ¡°We¡¯re wishing him all the best. Jeff Reine, who has been with Foursquare for two years, was named the new VP of Business Development and Enterprise.¡±The company raised $45 million at the beginning of last year?as it began to capitalize on its data business as co-founder Dennis Crowley took a step back. That data business, indeed, is probably the company¡¯s strongest asset as its location services power myriad services. As Foursquare looks to continue building out those partnerships, Harkey¡¯s departure may be a bit of a speed bump, as he takes with him over to Google a lot of experience working with the platform. Foursquare is going to have to continue building out those kinds of partnerships if it¡¯s going to thrive off its data business.Over that time, the company has gathered as many as 125,000 developers?and powers location services for companies like Uber and Airbnb. While starting off as a consumer product, Foursquare was able to create a thorough set of so-called ¡°true¡± locations of venues, which might not be a specific latitude and longitude but rather a general area that exists in the minds of consumers. And it built a suite of developer tools on top of that, allowing developers to quickly tap that data if they need a big data set of venues, locations and information around those.We also reached out to Harkey, and will update when we hear back."
165,Apps,"Apple today is introducing a new way for app developers to acquire users for their apps: it¡¯s launching a pay-per-install advertising product called Search Ads Basic. The ¡°basic¡± branding signals that this product is being aimed at smaller developers compared with the existing Search Ads product, which is now being renamed to Search Ads Advanced.Launched last year, Search Ads have been one of the biggest changes to date in terms of improving discovery of mobile applications on the App Store. The idea with the original Search Ads product was to help developers better target potential users using specific information ? like location, gender, keywords, and whether or not they¡¯ve ever installed the app before.After configuring a campaign, those ads would then appear at the top of the App Store search results when users searched for a keyword or terms, like ¡°games,¡± or ¡°war games,¡± for example.Developers paid for these ad placements when users tapped on them.That product, now called Search Ads Advanced, isn¡¯t going away. Instead, it¡¯s being joined by a more entry-level option, Search Ads Basic.In this case, developers aren¡¯t paying for taps, but for actual app installations as a result of the ad.Setting up a Search Ads Basic campaign has also been designed to be a much simpler process. The only parameters that have to be entered are the app to be advertised, the budget, and the amount the developer wants to pay per install.Here, Apple will helpfully suggest the maximum the developer should pay based on historical data from the App Store related to the type of app being marketed. While other pay-per-install ad campaigns from third parties may offer similar results in terms of installs, Apple¡¯s advantage is that it has direct access to App Store data and the ads themselves show up directly in the App Store ? not elsewhere on the web.Apple¡¯s implementation of ad targeting also respects user privacy. While it does use its historical understanding of App Store trends to help target ads, it doesn¡¯t build specific profiles on individual users for targeting purposes.In addition to the ease-of-use, a side effect of using Apple¡¯s Search Ads product is that it can lead to a higher chart ranking. Apple¡¯s algorithm takes into consideration number of downloads and velocity of those installs to move an app up the Top Charts. Because Apple considers an install from Search Ads a ¡°high quality¡± download, it counts those installs towards the app¡¯s chart position and its rise.There are no limitations on the type of app or size of the company that can use Search Ads Basic, but it will make the most sense for smaller shops who aren¡¯t yet ready to toy with Search Ads¡¯ more advanced options. Plus, Search Ads Basic limits budgets to $5,000 per month, while Search Ads Advanced has no such upper limit.Since its launch, Search Ads have been largely embraced by developers as an easy way to increase their app¡¯s exposure. Apple¡¯s data indicates that conversion rates for the original Search Ads product have been holding steady at over 50 percent, while the cost per acquisition has been below $1.50. Compared to other platforms, this is below the market norms.The new ad product is launching today and will be available on searchads.apple.com alongside the Search Ads Advanced offering. From there, developers can start their campaigns then track results in an online dashboard showing how many users installed the app, the campaign budget, and the amount paid.Initially launched in the U.S., Search Ads were more recently expanded internationally, to markets including the U.K., Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Switzerland and Mexico.However, Search Ads Basic won¡¯t roll out to these markets until sometime next year."
166,Apps,"As Pinterest looks to further expand beyond just the audience you¡¯d expect to use it, it¡¯s going to have to start chasing down users and meet them on different territories ? and that includes messaging apps.So today Pinterest is launching a pair of updates that is going to help it tap into that audience of people that are sharing content on Facebook Messenger. People might already be copying links to Pinterest and pasting them in?Messenger, but the company is looking to make that a little more seamless to get to the point where you can go into Messenger and be able to regularly interact with Pinterest.The bot works as you¡¯d expect ? you open up a chat with the Pinterest bot and type in an idea you¡¯re interested in, like food or clothing. The bot will then start recommending ideas from Pinterest, for which you can take a deeper dive in at any point if you¡¯re interested in them. Pinterest is the latest in a wave of companies to see some kind of opportunity in a platform like Messenger, though it still seems the full story on that has yet to play out.The chat extension brings Pinterest¡¯s experience closer to the Messenger experience, allowing users to both link out pins in a Facebook message and dive deeper into that content within the messenger. So when you go into a pin on Messenger, you¡¯ll start to see and feel something that is a little bit like the core Pinterest experience without actually leaving Messenger.This isn¡¯t the first time we¡¯ve seen Pinterest start to look beyond just its home platform in order to get people closer and closer to executing on an idea. Pinterest earlier this year rolled out QR codes that will show up in stores, another move that¡¯s trying to collapse the distance between a user¡¯s everyday behavior and getting them to actually get on Pinterest and start saving content.With more than 200 million monthly active users, Pinterest is still a bit of a blip compared to Facebook ? though, the audience behavior is certainly different in a lot of ways. But as Pinterest looks to continue to grow, it has to start looking in places that it might not normally look in order to get people interested in the service. Getting tied more closely with Facebook Messenger, a service with more than 1 billion users, seems like a pretty natural place to start."
167,Apps,"Apple¡¯s played a central role in podcast since its earliest days ? heck, even the term was borrowed from its big hardware product at the time. But the company¡¯s marketshare appears to have eroded somewhat as players like Google and Spotify have entered the market, reportedly down from 70-percent of podcast downloads in 2015 to 55-percent in 2017.That¡¯s still not a bad place to be, but the more podcasts become legitimized through big name shows like Serial, the more the company will have to bat back the competition. In light of all this, Apple may well be planting its flag in the sand. This morning, the Hot Pod newsletter reported that the company had picked up a small Bay Area-based startup called Pop Up Archive in what appears to the be an effort to build up its in-house podcasting tools. The company offered TechCrunch a followup, noting, ¡°Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.¡± As for what those plans are, keeping Pop Up Archive operating as is doesn¡¯t appear to be on the list. The startup abruptly closed up shop late last month, a day after posting message on Twitter asking users to download all of their content before then. You¡¯ve likely not heard of the company, unless this is a world you follow closely. Pop Up Archive was founded back in? 2012 and has remained pretty small since then. We first caught wind of it back in 2014, when it appeared at the 500 Startups Demo Day. At the time, the company was demonstrating a tool that tags audio usually transcribed textual data. A user uploads a podcast and it offers tags.Sounds like a small thing, sure, but it¡¯s a potentially important one when you¡¯re dealing with long audio files. iTunes and the iPhone Podcast app could greatly benefit from additional contextual search. It would go a long way toward finding and recommending content via the service. At the moment, Apple¡¯s recommendations are limited to similar shows. Pop Archive also maintained Audiosearch, a podcast search engine that also closed up shop on November 28. "
168,Apps,"A lack of apps wasn¡¯t my biggest issue with the Fitbit Ionic ? but it was up there. The inclusion of a third-party app store was one of the ways the company was looking to set the device apart from the rest of its products, and aside from a couple of high profile partners, there really wasn¡¯t much worth mentioning. Things are looking a bit better as of this morning. The company noted in a blog post that 60 apps and 100 watch faces have been added or are coming soon to the Ionic ecosystem. They¡¯re not all really notable, but there are enough big names on the list to warrant a second look at Fitbit¡¯s first true smartwatch. Some biggies include: The New York Times, Yelp, Uber, Lyft, Nest and United Airlines. Deezer¡¯s also getting in on the action next year, becoming the second notable music service after Pandora to buy in to the Ionic ecosystem. The streaming service is hoping to pick up some new devotees by bringing offline streaming to the watch. In terms of name recognition, it¡¯s a notable step down from a Spotify, but when it comes to taking music and leaving the phone behind, it¡¯s a start at least. Some of the new apps arrive at the height of the holiday gift buying season, so perhaps they¡¯ll make the Ionic a more tempting, Android compatible alternative to the Apple Watch. It¡¯s a bummer, of course, that the product didn¡¯t launch with this full an app selection, but if nothing else, it shows that Fitbit¡¯s committed to building the thing up as quickly as possible.After all, when we spoke with CEO James Park during at the device¡¯s launch, he told us that the company¡¯s purchase of Pebble was essentially a software acquisition. Fitbit knew it would be launching an app ecosystem from scratch, and Pebble¡¯s team had the development tools to make porting an app to its new smartwatch OS a much easier task. Developing for yet another new app store is a pain, but at least Fitbit¡¯s making the job a little simpler.?Of course, the Ionic still has its share of issues. I¡¯m not really a fan of the hardware design, which, among other things, isn¡¯t nearly flexible enough to fit on smaller wrists, knocking out a big potential user base. But as multiple acquisitions have shown, the company¡¯s all-in here, and perhaps the next generation device will address those issues as the app selection continues to grow and users shift their focus toward smart devices.

169,Apps,"Instagram is copying Snapchat¡¯s Memories feature and going a step further, letting you create a permanent home to show off formerly ephemeral content. Rolling out globally today on iOS and Android, Instagram Stories will now automatically Archive your Stories to a private part of your profile when they disappear 24 hours after being posted.You¡¯ll then be able to create Stories Highlights, which are named collections of your past Stories that show up in a new horizontal bar across the top of your profile. You could make Highlights of a specific vacation, all your selfies, or the cutest dogs you¡¯ve seen, while brands will surely use it to highlight different product lines and ad campaigns.¡°As more and more people adopt Stories, we realized that the profile has become less and less representative of you and your life¡± an Instagram spokesperson tells me. ¡°And yet the profile is one of the top destinations on Instagram ? it¡¯s a powerful space for self-expression and feeling closer to others. But up until now there was no way to keep your favorite stories or add them to your profile ? we wanted to fix that.¡±There are three important value-adds to these featuresSave Your Work ? Archive and Highlights could make investing time in creating Stories feel less wasteful. It might have seemed silly going through the work of shooting Stories and jazzing them up with captions and stickers if they¡¯d disappear the next day. This could make Stories appeal to older demographics whose friends might not be so addicted to Instagram that they open to watch Stories every single day. Highlights will surely be well utilized by brands who pour resources into shooting Stories, and now can create product or campaign specific collections.Preserve Your Storage ? Now you won¡¯t have to worry about expending your phone¡¯s storage space by downloading?your old Stories. Instead, Instagram will save them in the cloud, where you can privately view, publicly share, or re-download them later. For younger users on older phones with limited space, that could be a life saver.Expressing Your Identity?? Instagram has never before let you share without that content being visible on the homescreen to your followers. That meant it could feel like you were spamming friends if you wanted to share niche content, deterring content creation. Stories Highlights will let you exhibit the different angles of yourself. You could create a Highlight of just your cat, your food, your favorite art, or your professional life.TechCrunch broke the news of Instagram launching an Archive feature for your permanent feed posts in December which was designed to let people temporarily or permanently hide their past feed posts in order to deter people from impulsively deleting content they later want back.Instagram Stories Archive and Highlights one-up Snapchat Memories, which only lets your repost old clips to your current Story. There¡¯s still no permanent content on your Snapchat profile. Rather than forcing ephemerality, Instagram is making it optional to appeal to a wider audience. It¡¯s a similar choice to YouTube with its new Stories product Reels, which also don¡¯t expire after 24 hours.Archive will be activated automatically for everyone soon, and you¡¯ll get a notification when it opens to you with the option to turn it off. Stories clips are saved in the same quality you uploaded them at. You can find the Archive on your Profile and switch between the Stories Archive and Posts Archive. Archived posts appear in reverse chronological order with date stamps for clarity. You can¡¯t download your entire Archive at once, but instead will have to download individual clips. Archived posts can be reshared to Highlights, Direct Messages, the feed, or downloaded and then pushed to your current Story.Users were often already downloading their Stories before they expired, but often might forget, causing them to lose their content. Now they don¡¯t have to think about it.To create a Highlight, tap New on the left side of your profile, choose Stories from your archive, choose a cover image for the Highlight, and name it. That Highlight will appear as a Stories-style bubble atop the profile and play like one big Story when tapped by one of your followers. They¡¯ll remain visible unless you delete them, and you can remove clips but not reorder them.You can add up to 100 photos or videos to a Story Highlight, and there¡¯s no limit to how many Highlights you can create. Similarly, if you add more than 100 clips to your current Story, the first one will be removed and added to your Archive. And if you don¡¯t want any trace of your old Stories available privately to you, you can opt out and turn off Stories Archive.Together, these features could further encourage Instagram Stories¡¯ 300 million users to post more about a wider variety of content, knowing it doesn¡¯t have to disappear."
170,Apps,"Consumer spending on all mobile app stores will surpass $110 billion in 2018, according to a new report from App Annie, out today, which forecasts the state of the app ecosystem for next year. The $110 billion figure represents a 30 percent increase from the year prior, the firm also said, adding that the majority of the overall spend will come from games, as before.However, the introduction of in-app subscriptions ? a newer monetization model for apps ? is starting to have an impact on non-games¡¯ share of consumer spend. Though games still dominate in terms of overall dollars spent, the share for non-game apps will increase in 2018 as its growth is now outpacing that for games, App Annie said.In addition, the report called out China, India and Brazil as top countries to watch in 2018. China¡¯s growth rate, in particular, will ¡°significantly outpace¡± the rate for the rest of the world. That¡¯s even more notable given that China is already the top market today for iOS App Store consumer spend.India and Brazil, meanwhile, will see time spent on Android phones increasing in 2018, continuing the trend from this year which saw 50 percent and 30 percent growth, respectively, over 2017. India also has seen a big jump in Google Play downloads, coinciding with the launch of Reliance Jio¡¯s network in September 2016. And the emerging market of Brazil still has room for further growth since ? like India ? it has a large population who does not yet own a smartphone.Other changes impacting the app ecosystem include the app store revamps from both Apple and Google Play this year. In 2018, these efforts to improve app discovery will continue to gain traction, prompting increased downloads of entertainment apps and others meant for users¡¯ leisure time. This increased discovery will also lead to a rise in in-app purchases, App Annie said. Meanwhile, needs-based apps and utilities will still be found more often by app store searches and word-of-mouth recommendations.The report also called out a particular category of apps ? AR apps ? as seeing increased adoption in 2018.For example, Niantic¡¯s upcoming Harry Potter: Wizards Unite will generate excitement for AR gaming, while apps that layer additional context over the real world, including Google Translate and MLB.com At Bat, will?see widespread traction with users.Another category of apps that has driven a large amount of consumer spend this year is streaming video apps. Year-to-date through October 2017, streaming video apps have led to an increase of over 85 percent in consumer spend on iOS, and over 70 percent on Google Play. This space is becoming increasingly fragmented ? in the U.S., for example,??the share of those had four or more of the top video streaming apps installed on their iPhones increased year-over-year to more than 30 percent in October.The report delved into other trends for the following year, including mobile¡¯s growing role as a part of e-commerce transactions, including mobile food ordering, and more.It also mentioned Amazon Alexa¡¯s rise, in terms of its mobile app¡¯s presence on the app stores. For example,?App Annie said that downloads of the Amazon Alexa companion app trended upwards after the October 2016 release of the sub-$50 Echo Dot, with other big spikes around the holidays and Amazon Prime Day.The report says these same trends will continue next year, with spikes around sales holidays and other device deals, like the recently release of the $49 Google Home Mini.The full report is available from App Annie¡¯s website."

173,Apps,"Femtech startup Clue is looking at expanding the feature-set of its period tracking app to attract women outside its current younger demographic.¡°Menopause is a huge space,¡± said founder Ida Tin, speaking on stage here at TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin. ¡°I¡¯ve been submerged into this area of female health for almost a decade now and every day I learn something new and everywhere I look I¡¯m like ¡®why is nobody dealing with this?¡¯¡°Where is technology? How is technology serving women¡¯s needs when they go through menopause? There is nothing ? it¡¯s really, really just this open space. So what we really want to do with Clue is to kind of be a companion as they walk through life.¡±While she said the current priority for the app is adding more features to serve its existing user base, who are mainly using it for period tracking, features for tracking menopause?symptoms could also be added ¡°in the coming months and years¡±.The transformative potential of tracking data to unlock a deeper understanding of health issues was also discussed during the session.¡°Give it a few years and I think that people will start understanding that having this longitude data-set of your health is going to be an incredibly valuable thing to have ? almost like life insurance,¡± said Tin.¡°Because we will learn to pick up early signals of disease that currently we have no ways to detect early enough ? ovarian cancer would be one of them. Which is totally treatable if you catch it early. But it¡¯s hard to catch it early.¡°And I think there will be many more things like this where people will learn to know that collecting data for your health is just a really, really smart thing to do.¡±But on the data front she also cautioned that technology companies pushing into the health space really need to prioritize data transparency and ethics.Taking time to do due diligence on potential partners is one of the reasons Clue has been holding off on doing more integrations with third parties which could expand its own data pipe, she added, noting also that it would rather partner with a hardware maker than build its own devices.Hardware devices that are really exciting her are ¡°the kind of things that can tell us about what¡¯s going on in the body at a more molecular level¡±, she said.¡°And also things where the user experience can be true mass market ? I think at the moment we have some solutions for natural family planning but¡¦ the user experience is not what it needs to be for it to be something that¡¯s really working for a lot of people. So those are the kinds of things we think we have ideas that could make that better.¡±¡°That¡¯s definitely an ambition that we have to integrate with a lot of different things ? and it¡¯s wonderful to be in this space of femtech because there is so much happening,¡± added Tin.?¡°But we¡¯ve been holding off til we¡¯ve figured out what really to do with those extra data streams, what partnership we felt is a really good brand fit.¡°Especially with some of the big corporations ? we want to really make sure that we have the user¡¯s needs at the center of our attention. And make sure that we can navigate something as challenging as a partnership with a big corporation without that, in the end, not benefiting the user.¡±Responding to a question about?concerns raised in the UK by a data-sharing and app development partnership between ad giant Google DeepMind and the country¡¯s National Health Service, she said: ¡°I think the lack of transparency is really problematic.¡±This summer, a 2015 agreement between the Royal Free NHS Trust and DeepMind was judged by the UK¡¯s data protection watchdog to have broken privacy laws. Under the arrangement, the medical records of 1.6M patients using three London hospitals passed to DeepMind without the people¡¯s knowledge or consent ? and, as it turned out, with no legal basis for the information to be shared.¡°Things that happen without users understanding where their data is going I think just shouldn¡¯t happen,¡± said Tin.¡°There¡¯s always this kind of tension between ? that data can be used for bad and data that can be used for good. And I think right now there¡¯s so much connotation that data is kind of a negative thing, and people are misusing it, selling it, hacking it, breaking it. And I really want to also raise the voice ? and it¡¯s a fantastic thing that we can now understand all this thing that we couldn¡¯t understand before. And really be a stance that we can use data for good ? we just need to get it right. We shouldn¡¯t shy away and think data¡¯s bad.¡°Data¡¯s fantastic ? it¡¯s when we misuse it, it becomes problematic,¡± she added.?¡°So let¡¯s build good, ethical, solid data companies.¡°It¡¯s starts with a very deep, ethical choice that you make as a founder, as a company¡¦ What kind of company do we want to be?

The only difference between that and today, is that shoppers can now also choose to pay using their Target REDcard at the same time.Target¡¯s?REDcard is available as both a debit card that links to customers¡¯ bank accounts and a store credit card, and offers 5 percent back on purchases to encourage its use.According to the retailer, the advantage for consumers is faster checkout ? up to four times faster than ¡°other payment types¡± it says, a jab at traditional payment methods like chip-and-PIN cards, for example, which are notoriously slow. (Of course, the retailer benefits, too, by pushing users to REDcard where it saves on credit card processing fees.)In the near future, Target Wallet will also support the ability to add and pay with Target GiftCards as well, the retailer says.Target isn¡¯t the only major brick-and-mortar retailer with its own payments system.

(Perhaps we should give Target credit for not naming its solution Target Pay.)In addition to saving the company money by shifting consumers to store cards, in-house mobile payment solutions give retailers access to the consumer data they would have otherwise given up, had the shopper checked out with a mobile payment solution like Apple Pay, where that data is not shared.¡°Wallet in the Target app makes checkout easier and faster than ever,¡± said Mike McNamara, Target¡¯s chief information and digital officer, in a statement about Wallet¡¯s launch. ¡°Guests are going to love the convenience of having payment, Cartwheel offers, Weekly Ad coupons and GiftCards all in one place with Wallet.¡±The new Wallet feature is available on both Android and iOS versions of the Target app."
175,Apps,"Facebook and Instagram have begun testing a feature that allows you to more easily bring your Instagram contacts into Messenger. The experience, which is entirely opt-in for the app¡¯s users, is the latest in a series of integrations between Instagram and Facebook¡¯s properties, which has earlier included the cross-posting of Instagram Stories to Facebook as well as the ability to launch the Instagram app directly from Facebook.?This time around, the two apps are making it simpler to sync your Instagram and Messenger accounts with one another.In Messenger, you can now visit the People tab and tap on the new option ¡°Connect to Instagram¡± to add your Instagram contacts to the list of friends you can reach with Facebook¡¯s instant messaging application. You can also add your Instagram contacts from the Messenger sign-up flow, if you¡¯re a new user.Only your mutual follow contacts on Instagram will be imported, so there¡¯s no concern that Instagram followers will now be able to spam you on Messenger, even if you don¡¯t follow them back.?The option makes sense given that Instagram Messaging today is a heavily used feature ? 375 million users were on Instagram Direct as of this April, for example. Presumably, these are Instagram friends you might want to chat with when on Messenger, too.The integration is yet another example of how Facebook is leveraging its multiple mobile properties smartly to keep users in its ecosystem, and building out an even larger social network as a result. After all, not all Instagram users are Messenger users or Facebook users.Plus, when the company combines its social graphs like this it¡¯s able to better connect the dots when there¡¯s overlap (potentially meaning more social data for advertisers in the long run).Facebook and Instagram aren¡¯t formally announcing the launch of this feature, but we understand it¡¯s something the company has recently begun testing.[h/t Jose Gutierrez]"
176,Apps,"Thanks to technology, making an audio recording of a meeting is a trivially easy task these days. While speech to text services can help tackle the tedium of transcription, this just invites a slew of new problems: The need to clean up and confirm transcripts. To verify who said what.?Not to mention having to ensure everyone consented to being recorded ? and gets a timely copy of the meeting minutes afterwards.On the value-add side, a manager might also wish for an easy way to generate a summary of key points after a meeting. And a tool that can automatically list any tasks so they don¡¯t have to go back and pick them out of their notes. Analytics around meeting productivity could also be useful ? helping answer questions like: Are my meetings running to time? Which speakers tend to dominate? How many decisions are being made and actioned?These are the sorts of assistance capabilities that US-incorporated startup?Reason8?has in the works for its AI-powered transcription service, which is launching out of beta today from the TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin stage.Down the line the team reckons the tech will also be able to offer users linguistic and voice analysis ? with the potential to act like a coach and offer individual guidance on improving in-meeting performance.¡°In-person meetings are the least digitized field in personal communications,¡± says co-founder Vlad Belyaev, discussing the idea behind the product. ¡°It is a huge market. All of us make meetings, and make meeting notes, write meeting summaries, meeting minutes.¡°Our first niche is to focus on managers who spend a large amount of time on making meeting minutes and on tracking the tasks that they gave to their employees.¡±The target user for Reason8 is a middle manager who has three to four meetings per day and thus sinks a lot of time into distilling hot air into summaries and trackable tasks. ¡°We are trying to make their life easier and more productive,¡± is his concise summary of the product goal.At least two smartphones are required to record any one meeting via the app. This both provides enough audio input data for the speaker-separating AI to work with, and also means multiple meeting participants can participate in grabbing the record of the meeting if they wish. So it aims to help with the consent and ownership issue, too.Belyaev says the idea for the app came about after he¡¯d worked as a secretary and executive assistant ? and spent a lot of time compiling and sharing meeting minutes. The challenge of keeping meeting participants who were spread across multiple timezones in the loop was another pain-point that fed the app idea.The team incorporated in Delaware in May 2016 and in November last year raised $1.2 million in early-stage funding from Russian business angels to help fund development of their MVP.The app is iOS only for now, it being easier to calibrate microphones across the more homogenous iPhone hardware than Android¡¯s diverse range of devices. But an Android version is planned for next year, says Belyaev.Reason8 is using?Google¡¯s cloud speech API?for the speech to text conversion of meeting audio captured via its app ? so the first thing to note is it¡¯s not trying to replicate competitive and robust speech recognition technology that¡¯s already available in the market.Rather, its focus is on making that existing technology more useful in the context of meetings and managers. Its special sauce is a deep learning model trained to be able to identify different voices and thus to separate out speakers within a transcript ? meaning the user doesn¡¯t just get handed one big block of text.This works without users needing to train it, according to Belyaev, who says the AI is able to separate speakers from the very first meeting. (And once individual users have identified themselves in the app it can link their name with their voice footprint to include their real name in meeting transcripts, too.)¡°We use deep learning for better understanding your digital footprint of your own voice,¡± he notes. ¡°We make it in a fully unsupervised way. So we do not need data for learning to distinguish speakers between each other.¡±The second bit of Reason8¡¯s proprietary tech is a natural language processing engine that it¡¯s using to automatically identify specific tasks agreed on in the meeting.This engine, which the team trained using open data sets, was developed out of an earlier product they deployed in the Russian market ? aimed at helping companies improve the performance of their customer support services.¡°We developed our own natural language understanding engine. One of the main features of this engine was and is that we are able to work with a very little amount of data,¡± he says, adding: ¡°Very few amount of businesses have data to train the model. That was why we created the solution which is able to identify the sense of phrases.¡°We are able to classify this meaning and identify ? for instance ? tasks from decisions and from ideas.¡±How does the system avoid getting confused by the codified word salad that can get thrown around in meetings? By focusing on analyzing phrases rather than individual words, he says on that.¡°We don¡¯t analyze exact words ? we analyze the whole phrases,¡± he tells TechCrunch. ¡°That is why we analyze the meaning of the phrases. We¡¯ve been developing our natural language engine for the last year and this gave us opportunity to better understand the meaning of exact phrases which people mention.¡±The initial focus on extracting tasks is also a way for the team to shrink and tackle the linguistic context challenge that¡¯s at the core of what they¡¯re trying to do. ¡°Tasks mainly have a very clear intent so you can mention that someone has to do something with a current deadline and this is easier to identify,¡± he says. ¡°We decided to focus on a very narrow problem ? so identifying tasks and then later decisions and ideas.¡±The ambition is for the NLP engine to get smart enough to be able to automatically create meeting summaries in future too. For that another current feature of the app is key: A highlight button that users can manually tap on within the app to flag important sections of a meeting while it¡¯s going on. This tells the tech to take note. Any highlighted portions will then be incorporated into the meeting report it delivers.But these manual highlights are also a learning signal for the tech. Belyaev says it¡¯s feeding them into the model to help it get better at understanding vocal intonation during important moments in meetings.¡°With this information we are able to capture data-sets that defines not only by the meaning but also by intonation, by context that you say something important,¡± he explains. ¡°When I say something important i¡¯m trying to be precise, I¡¯m trying to make pauses and to emphasize the intonation on it.¡°So with all this context information ? so not only from the text which we already have huge experience on, but also from the sounds ? so we are able to identify better and to give better quality for our summarization engine.¡±¡°Looking further, our vision is to provide for people a tool with which they could make meeting minutes and meeting summaries easily and a digitally enabled path to gather these self-enforcing data sets,¡± he adds. ¡°So if people are using our product they improve their productivity with drafts of meeting minutes, then they make their own meeting minutes and send it to their colleagues.¡±For now, the engine can identify tasks. Soon ? ¡°in the next few weeks¡± ? it¡¯ll also be able to classify ¡°ideas and decisions¡±. But it isn¡¯t yet capable of serving up fully fledged meeting summarizes. Instead users get a brief report with any manual highlights they trigger.Belyaev says the?plan is to add integrations with other communications tools ? such as Google Hangouts, Zoom and Slack ? in order to ¡°capture more information to improve our summarization engine¡±. And they¡¯re penciling in Spring 2018 for the full AI-powered meeting summarization feature to launch, he adds.They also plan to integrate with existing project management systems to further expand the utility of the product. So, for example, a task automatically extracted from a meeting transcript could also be automatically inputted into a PMS.¡°A transcript is great but for business in person meetings, meeting minutes and meeting summarizes add more value than just a transcript,¡± he argues. ¡°Because, yes a transcript gives more value than just a record but what is even better is a summary and automatic task extraction and further integrations with project management systems like Asana or Jira¡¦ So it automatically creates tasks in project management systems. So it would be really great for improving productivity for managers and I think for many other potential users.¡±Though he also emphasizes that the system is not going to be 100 percent perfect at parsing context ? so also isn¡¯t going to be able to entirely replace assistants. Rather it¡¯s intended as a productivity-boosting aid.?The speaker separated transcription feature works for any language already supported by Google¡¯s speech to text tech, according to Belyaev.But the pre-trained models that power task and (soon) decision identification have been trained on English language speech so aren¡¯t currently able to support additional languages. Though he says they are planning?to train models on data-sets in other languages in future to expand support.The team¡¯s first commercial push for the product is focused on the US market. Pricing is freemium for now ? with a limited usage basic version of the app and a pro subscription for those who want unlimited use and all the features.The initial target is B2C earlier adopters who may be most comfortable prioritizing productivity gains over and above the privacy concerns associated with a technology that currently works by streaming audio data to the cloud for processing.?On the privacy front, Record8¡¯s website states that it¡¯s encrypting the data in transit and claims not to be storing any meeting data. But even so there are major privacy considerations and risks given it¡¯s uploading recordings of private and potentially sensitive business meetings to the cloud. Risks that make its the current offering unsuitable for many businesses.Belyaev says the team does intend to address the wider enterprise market in future ? such as by offering a bespoke private cloud version of the system ? but is starting with B2C and consumers first to push for traction to verify market demand. They¡¯ll also be able to use the data of early adopters to continue honing their models to improve the product.¡°In our plans, in the next half a year, we are aiming at enterprises,¡± he says. ¡°If enterprises will want our solution on a paid basis ? so they might like to make an?in house private cloud solution with analytics, recommendations and all features of our product, so we are ready to provide it.¡°We know for management consultant firms they would prefer to keep all the information on their servers or some private cloud like Amazon but they like to use their own solution for privacy concerns. So yes we will be able to provide it, we¡¯re interested in providing it but we¡¯d like to start with the B2C segment and with end customers by providing them an app for meeting summarization and transcription.¡±"
177,Apps,"For the first time, Facebook is opening up to children under age 13 with a privacy-focused app designed to neutralize child predator threats that plague youth-focused competitors like Snapchat. Rolling out today on iOS in the U.S., ¡°Messenger Kids¡± lets parents download the app on their child¡¯s phone or tablet, create a profile for them and approve friends and family with whom they can text and video chat from the main Messenger app.Tweens don¡¯t sign up for a Facebook account and don¡¯t need a phone number, but can communicate with other Messenger and Messenger Kids users parents sign-off on, so younger siblings don¡¯t get left out of the family group chat. ¡°We¡¯ve been working closely with the FTC so we¡¯re lockstep with them. ¡®This works¡¯, they said,¡±?Facebook product management director Loren Cheng tells me. ¡°In other apps, they can contact anyone they want or be contacted by anyone,¡± Facebook¡¯s head of Messenger David Marcus notes.Special proactive detection safety filters prevent children from sharing nudity, sexual content or violence, while a dedicated support team will respond quickly to reported or flagged content. Facebook even manually sifted Giphy to build a kid-friendly version of the GIF-sharing engine. And with childish augmented reality masks and stickers, video calls with grandma could be a lot more fun and a lot less silent or awkward.Facebook won¡¯t be directly monetizing Messenger Kids, automatically migrating kids to real accounts when they turn 13 or collecting data so that it complies with Children¡¯s Online Privacy Protections Act (COPPA) law. But the app could prime kids to become lifelong Facebook users, and lock their families deeply into the platform where they¡¯ll see ads.¡°When you think about things at scale that we do to get people to care more about Messenger, this is one that addresses a real need for parents,¡± say Facebook¡¯s head of Messenger David Marcus. ¡°But the side effect will be that they use Messenger more and create family groups.¡± Marcus tells me he¡¯s excited about getting his 8-year-old into the family chat alongside his 14- and 17-year-old children.It¡¯s important to understand that kids under 13 still can¡¯t sign up for a Facebook account. Instead, parents download the Messenger Kids app to a child¡¯s iPhone or iPad (Android coming soon). Once the parent has authenticated it with their own account, they set up a mini-profile with their kid¡¯s name and photo. Then, using the Messenger Kids bookmark in the main Facebook app, parents can approve anyone who is friends with them as a contact for their kid, like aunts and uncles or godparents. Messenger Kids is interoperable with the main Messenger app, so adults don¡¯t actually have to download the Kids app.Kids still can¡¯t be found through Facebook search, which protects their privacy. So if a child wants to be able to chat with one of their classmates, their parent must first friend that kid¡¯s parent, and then will see the option to approve that adult¡¯s child as a contact for their own kid. This is by far the most clumsy part of Messenger Kids, and something Facebook might be able to improve with a way for Messenger Kids to let children perhaps photograph a QR code on their playmate¡¯s app to request that their parents connect.When children open the Messenger Kids app, they¡¯ll see a color-customizable home screen with big tiles representing their existing chat threads and approved contacts, with their last message and the last time they were online. From there, kids can dive instantly into a video chat or text thread with their contacts. No message content is collected for ad targeting (same as Messenger), and there¡¯s no in-app purchases to worry about. Kids can block and unblock their parent-approved contacts.Facebook hired a special team to develop kid-friendly creative tools, from fidget spinner and dinosaur AR masks to crayon-style stickers. ¡°Video calls become so much more playful with AR,¡± says Marcus. Sometimes after 5 or 10 minutes it¡¯s really hard to have a sustained conversation with a 7-year-old,¡± but kids can joke around with Grampa using the selfie filters when they run out of run-on stories to tell them.Messenger features like location sharing and payments have been stripped out, while the Kids version of Giphy won¡¯t let you search for things like ¡°sex.¡± Facebook actually manually selected a set of GIFs that kids can use rather than relying on a third-party startup to tag things well enough. Still, a reporting interface written specifically for kids lets them flag anything sketchy to a dedicated support team working 24/7.One thing that might surprise some people is that there¡¯s no way for parents to secretly spy on what their kids are saying in their chats. Instead, parents have to ask to look at their kids¡¯ screen, which Chung says is a more common behavior pattern. The exception is that if kids report a piece of objectionable content, their parents will be notified but still not shown the content in their own app.In June, The Information reported Facebook was working on an app for teens called Talk, though that¡¯s a bit different than this pre-teen Messenger Kids app.While Facebook said in the briefing that the app was designed for kids age 6 to 12, younger kids are allowed on, too. When children turn 13, they won¡¯t instantly have their Messenger Kids profiles turned into real Facebook profiles, nor will they get kicked off Messenger Kids. They¡¯ll still have to build a traditional Facebook account from scratch when they¡¯re ready.Before Facebook wrote any code or drew any designs for the app, it says it started research 18 months ago to find out what kids and parents wanted out of a potential product. It also worked with the National Parent Teacher Association for safety insights and Blue Star Families from the military who have to stay in touch during long deployments.It found that kids had the right hardware but the wrong software; 93 percent of 6-12-year-olds in the U.S. have access to tablets or smartphones, while 66 percent have their own device, and?three out of every five parents surveyed said their kids under 13 use messaging apps, social media or both. But these apps weren¡¯t built for children¡¯s privacy, and instead allow adult strangers to contact or follow kids. Youth favorite Snapchat has reportedly been used by predators to groom kids for sexual exploitation, with authorities saying it¡¯s tough to track perverts because messages disappear.Most apps say that kids have to be at least 13, but there¡¯s nothing to stop younger children from signing up. That¡¯s true on Facebook too, and it could do more to prevent tweens from signing up. But at least parents have grown to understand Facebook. On Snapchat, where ephemerality can cover evidence of inappropriate contact, or Musical.ly, where kids dance provocatively in front of huge audiences, dangers mount and parents are often clueless.That¡¯s why it was smart that Facebook tasked Cheng with leading the project. He¡¯d spent the past few years on the ¡°tough experiences¡± team that handles fake accounts, violent content, sexual exploitation, self-harm and counter-terrorism. He¡¯s used to thinking about worst-case scenarios. Facebook built a whole portal at MessengerKids.com with more information for parents.Facebook is trying to cross every T and dot every I when it comes to safety with this new product. It would be reckless to invite kids onto a chat app otherwise. Still, it doesn¡¯t have the best track record on unintended consequences, and if it screws this up, the damage and backlash will be massive.The launch could be a sign that Facebook is growing up. With Facebook almost 14 years old itself, children not yet born when it launched are now allowed on its main app. CEO Mark Zuckerberg just had two kids. So did his lieutenants Chris Cox, CPO, and Andrew Bosworth, head of hardware. It¡¯s hard to think about connecting the world if your products can¡¯t connect your own family.¡°When I was in my mid-twenties, you never think you¡¯re going to be gone, ever,¡± Marcus admits. Now 33, ¡°[Zuckerberg] has been thinking a lot about the future he wants to leave behind for his kids.¡± Today his company is laying the foundation for an ageless social network."
178,Apps,"Onefootball founder and CEO Lucas von Cranach, whose popular football app now has 25 million fans in 200 countries around the world, confirmed on stage today at TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin 2017 that his company has raised more funding ? including both an unreported Series B and C round. This would bring the startup¡¯s total raise to date to over the $20 million publicly reported.The founder declined to share the new numbers on stage, but he did note that Adidas was one of the new investors. Von Cranach also noted that he¡¯s very deliberate about raising money. ¡°Raising capital is a necessity to match the goal which you are putting yourself forward,¡± he said. ¡°We¡¯ve raised some capital, but I always looked at the dilution, valuation and money in the bank triangle.¡±For a strategic investor like Adidas, access to Onefootball¡¯s mobile fan base can be more powerful than any mobile initiative they could build on their own. Numerous studies have shown that today¡¯s consumers only use a handful of apps on a regular basis, so the likelihood of them hearing from a favorite brand like Adidas through a dedicated Adidas-branded application is slim to none.That¡¯s where Onefootball, which von Cranach described as a ¡°Facebook for football without the social element,¡± aims to come in. Instead of developing a distributed strategy with large followers across social platforms like Facebook and Twitter, von Cranach says Onefootball¡¯s users are directed to return to the app itself. Here, where some 90 percent have opted in to receive push notifications, brands could have a direct channel to their fans.¡°We don¡¯t have big followerships on Twitter or Facebook and all of these platforms,¡± he said. ¡°But we have consumers on the app and website who are constantly coming back.¡±The founder counts himself as one of the heaviest users of the app, in fact, spending at least an hour a day in a product he basically built for himself to address his own passions.But while the company is continuing to grow, with some of its users returning to the app 40 to 50 times per month, there are some areas Onefootball isn¡¯t planning to address, von Cranach noted.¡°We won¡¯t build a betting business, we won¡¯t build a merchandise business, and we won¡¯t build a ticketing business, ¡± he said. Instead, he explained, the company is ¡°building an experience at the top of the funnel¡± where it can increase the conversions¡¦ perhaps for brands like new investor Adidas, for example."
179,Apps,"What if you could play with landmarks instead of just touring them? Nexto is turning audio guides into games to make sightseeing more interactive. Launching today as part of TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin¡®s Battlefield competition, Nexto is partnering with tourist destinations to help them attract more visitors and earn more money to fund culture.¡°We wanted to make heritage more exciting and accessible to the younger generation¡± says Nexto co-founder and chief product officer?Tadej Strok. ¡°Instead of Pokemon, people would collect virtual heritage artifacts and compete in exploring historic stories and learn something meaningful along the way.¡±Nexto serves as an alternative for the traditional audio guide, with its clunky hardware and uncomfortable headphones you have to rent. Instead, you use your own phone and its tiny loudspeaker or headphones, and download Nexto¡¯s iOS or Android app. The multimedia tours and games can be downloaded for offline use to avoid burning your roaming data as you wander through cities, castles, archeological sites, and temples.The experiences themselves combine traditional audio guide content with mini games like puzzles, riddles, and hunting down virtual items at real-world locations you scan with your phone. Since people are using modern smartphones instead of what are essentially old-school Walkmans, Nexto tours can include augmented reality elements where historical characters pop out of the landscape. Through AR, ruins can be reconstructed to their old glory, and different layers of famous paintings can be revealed.Cultural venues can create these experiences with Nexto¡¯s own content management system, and the startup provides assistance for creating more immersive content. Venues can then decide whether to make content free to users, or a charge a fee for visitors to unlock the experiences. Venues pay Nexto a cut of sales, a monthly subscription to the platform based on active users, and/or a creative agency fee for content creation assistance.After three years of work, Nexto is launching an experience in Berlin today beyond its existing offerings in Slovenia, though it also has programs in four other countries in the works. It initially raised a government grant to get started, and now is in the seed round fundraising process.Nexto could turn lackluster villages, small-name museums, or less popular monuments into more popular destinations by spotlighting what¡¯s special about them. ¡°We know that every historic town has a cool and exciting local legend or folklore, but it is often communicated in a boring way, if at all¡± says Strok.The idea was inspired by role-playing games which often weave the player into a rich fictional history of a fantasy realm. But after 10 years in digital advertising and storytelling and doing a master¡¯s thesis on gamification, Strok wanted to turn tourists into adventurers. ¡°We feel that in today¡¯s society people are losing interest in culture and history, because they¡¯re constantly bombarded with entertainment industry spectacle and fluff¡± Strok tells me. Nexto could make education into something exciting enough to compete.The startup will have to compete with both traditional audio guide companies like Antenna International and Orpheo, which have expensive set-up costs since venues have to buy hardware to rent out, and must be centralized. Nexto¡¯s cloud availability and lack of dedicated hardware makes it more applicable to neighborhood tours that don¡¯t have a defined starting point. But at the same time, families who don¡¯t have a device for each member might prefer renting hardware.Meanwhile, startups like Detour, izi.travel, and Cloudguide are also piggybacking on visitors¡¯ own devices. They¡¯re more focused on translating traditional audio-only guides to mobile that could appeal to older demographics while Nexto concentrates on multimedia that could excite younger travelers.The biggest risk for Nexto is that building these interactive guides could be too confusing and laborious for some tourism boards and venues. It will have to figure out how to simplify this process or affordably do the content creation itself.Nexto hopes to soon be available in cities like?Paris, Prague, Rome and Barcelona, turning tales of their past into games of today. The bring-your-own-device revolution isn¡¯t just changing enterprise business and the on-demand workforce. Now that nearly everyone has a smartphone, startups like Nexto can turn anywhere into a place to learn and play."
180,Apps,"Slack has undoubtedly changed how employees at many companies communicate. But more and more, it feels like Slack¡¯s focus on immediate responses is far more distracting than the asynchronous emails it often replaces. As Slack CTO and co-founder Cal Henderson noted at TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin today, we still have to figure out how Slack can fit into many a company¡¯s culture and how to keep Slack discussions from going off topic despite the existence of GIFs and emoji. Internally, at Slack, the company mostly uses a raccoon for doing this.¡°Internally, we have this idea of the polite raccoon,¡± Henderson said. Whenever a conversation goes off topic, the raccoon means that it¡¯s time to take that conversation into a different channel (or maybe offline).Henderson noted, too, that a lot of the work that Slack is putting into machine learning is about making people more efficient and reducing the number of unnecessary messages. ¡°There is definitely more we can do in terms of filling up people¡¯s time so that can better separate between work and outside of work,¡± he said.Henderson himself, too, uses Slack¡¯s do-not-disturb setting to keep messages at bay during his off time, but throughout today¡¯s panel, he noted that it¡¯s very much up to the individual and company to set their policies. He also very much defended the existence of Slack itself.¡°Something like Slack would have existed even if we didn¡¯t build it,¡± he said. That¡¯s in part due to the rise of consumer messaging in general and the fact that businesses are now comfortable with buying their software from multiple vendors, which has resulted in a situation where there is no obvious center for business software.¡°Communication is the only obvious location to tie those together.¡±"
181,Apps,"Onstage today at our TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin Hackathon I have seen the future of my liver¡¦ and it looks bleak.The culprit behind my liver¡¯s imminent demise? WannaDrink, a hack that somehow manages to combine the amazing mission of providing tech education for recent immigrants to Germany and the promotion of anonymous drinking with complete strangers.?It¡¯s Tinder for finding drinking buddies, or, as Max put it jokingly onstage, ¡°it¡¯s anonymous ¡¦ for alcoholics.¡±It¡¯s the vision of Redi School teacher Manuel Laudam, student Maxim Matrenitski, a recent Russian emigr?; and Ravi Anand Kumar, who moved to Berlin three months ago to work with an IoT startup. WannaDrink is also the app I¡¯ve always/never wanted. (Redi School is a nonprofit digital school for tech-interested people who are applying for asylum in Germany.)WannaDrink¡¯s photo feature is ephemeral and only appears on the app for the duration of time that users want to be available to meet random strangers for drinks.Emboldened by the enthusiasm of certain members of the TechCrunch team for the app (it me), the team intends to try and turn their 36-hour hack into a real business and are looking to launch in the next few weeks.¡°We¡¯re going to make a plan and meet next weekend,¡± said Anand Kumar."
182,Apps,"Another neat hack idea being demoed here at TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin is an app for helping support runners during races by sending personal voice messages to keep them feeling motivated.The Cheer My Friend app doesn¡¯t need supporters to download an app in order to work ? only the runner needs the app on their device. Then they share a link with their support group ahead of time ? which lets friends and family record short voice messages to be delivered to them during the race.Runners will need to be running with a mobile device plus headphones to receive the messages. A mobile connected smartwatch plus earbuds would also work.Built by a team of five semi-pro hackathon attendees who¡¯ve flown in from Finland, presenter Tuomas Koskinen?says the idea was inspired because members of the team are keen marathon runners and had used some existing support apps that translate text to speech which they felt just weren¡¯t personal enough.¡°When you are really pushing yourself in marathon you need something more human. The thing is you are there in a huge crowd of people and you don¡¯t really know any of them because everybody¡¯s running their own race and they are there for their own reasons.

183,Apps,"Wish you didn¡¯t have to pay as much if you rarely went to the gym? Gym-As-You-Go wants to offer pricing based on usage rather than monthly subscriptions.The TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin Hackathon project uses NFC to let you check in at work-out machines. You¡¯re then charged a fee for how long you use the machine, and Gym-As-You-Go keeps a percentage. ¡°The most painful point of gyms are these 24 month contracts¡± says teammate?Sebastian Steins.Pay-as-you-go pricing could give lazy people who rarely work out a way to waste less money, and gyms a way to attract a different type of customer. Especially popular machines could be surge priced so they¡¯re always available if you¡¯re desperate for a certain exercise and don¡¯t have time to wait.Gyms could lower prices in off-peak hours to balance their attendance across the week to avoid overcrowding. And gyms would learn which equipment is the most popular so they can buy more, keep it maintained, or advertise that they have it.¡°Pay per use is very common in digital but not in the real world¡± says teammate?Tomas Ruiz.Like most hackathon projects, Gym-As-You-Go is a bit light on the details of how its partnerships with gyms would work, though it is built with SAP Hybris and Clover payments. Installing NFC readers on older machines could be a sizeable expense for gyms, though more and more are coming with it built in so people can track their own work-outs.With time, the set-up cost should come down. Partnering with an existing NFC sports equipment provider could make sure machines are already primed for Gym-As-You-Go.Cloud-connected gym equipment companies like eGym are already trying to reduce membership churn for gyms by getting people locked in with work-out tracking. But pay-as-you-go pricing could also create a direct incentive for modernization.Some gyms might worry about losing money if people opt to skip memberships they don¡¯t take advantage of in favor of a la carte pricing. But with so many gyms competing in big cities, alternatives to monthly subscriptions could be a powerful differentiator."

A new assistant called WACAO (aka, Whatsapp Chat Assistant) aims to help by summarizing what you missed while you were gone. The assistant can also translate messages between different languages and automate your happy birthday greetings to friends, among other things.WACAO was demonstrated today at the Disrupt Berlin 2017 Hackathon by Vivek Bombatkar and Sidharth Ramachandran, who met while working together at marketing analytics provider SuperCrunch.Explains Sidarth, the idea for WACAO came about because it was something he needed for himself.¡°I¡¯m a part of a lot of groups,¡± he says. ¡°I recently joined Slack, and it¡¯s just insane. If I step out for a meeting, there¡¯s two hundred messages when I return.¡±That same problem also exists in WhatsApp, thanks to numerous group chats with co-workers, friends, and family groups, he says.The WACAO chat assistant takes advantage of the web version of Whatsapp to read your messages and view your conversations. The package, meanwhile, is?based on the Github repo WebWhatsAPI, and provides a python interface for interacting with WhatsApp on the web.After getting WACAO set up ? something its developers want to make easier in the future by way of a Chrome extension ? you then create a WhatsApp group with just yourself and name it ¡°WACAO.¡±From that group, you can ask WACAO for help with summaries, translation, and other activities.For example, if you want a summary of your family¡¯s group chat, you would type ¡°summarize¡± followed by the group¡¯s name in the WACAO chat. The client then returns a brief summary of everything that¡¯s been discussed since you last checked in.Sidharth says the summarization technology used is a lot like those that summarize news articles, except it¡¯s been designed specifically for chats. The assistant uses NLP (natural language processing) technologies to understand what¡¯s being said, and looks for specific topics being discussed ? including those that have the most replies ? in order to determine what to summarize for you.It then returns a summary of the conversations you missed in the WACAO group chat.In addition, WACAO offers a handful of other features the team was able to build during the day they hacked on the project at the Disrupt Berlin 2017 hackathon.One feature, for example, leverages the Google Translate API to help you more easily chat with people who speak another language.To use this, you¡¯d just type ¡°translate to¡± followed by the language, the text you want to translate, and the person to send the message to ? the latter by typing ¡°and send to [person¡¯s name.]¡±The recipient will then receive your message in the language they speak and can reply normally. This reply is sent back, translated, to your WACAO chat.The assistant can also send out a preprogrammed ¡°happy birthday¡± message to family and friends by typing the ¡°HBD¡± command in the WACAO group, and it offers a ¡°Do Not Disturb¡± mode that will automatically reply to incoming chats while you¡¯re away with a message noting that you¡¯re not available.WACAO is available for anyone to try on Github."

The company still needs to flip a switch on its servers to enable it.Today¡¯s update also enables support for faster 7.5W Qi wireless charging. If you have an iPhone 8 or an iPhone X as well as a wireless charger that supports 7.5W or more, your phone will now charge more quickly as Apple first limited wireless charging to 5W.Some users have had some issues with the autocorrect feature. The default iOS keyboard would change ¡®it¡¯ into ¡®I.T¡¯ for no apparent reason. iOS 11.2 should fix that too.In iOS 11, if you tap on the Wi-Fi or Bluetooth icons in Control Center, iOS doesn¡¯t disable Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Instead, your phone disconnects itself from Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth accessories until the next day at 5 AM (or you restart your device, or you go to a new place for Wi-Fi).Apple doesn¡¯t disable those features so that you can connect your Apple Watch or Apple Pencil, enable Personal Hotspot from another device and use Wi-Fi for more accurate location features. With iOS 11.2, the icons are no longer greyed out. You¡¯ll now see white icons to indicate that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth still work, you¡¯re just not connected to any network or accessory.In smaller news, iOS 11.2 brings a couple of revamped emojis, new wallpapers, a new indicator at the top right of the lock screen to help you find Control Center and better Wi-Fi and Bluetooth indications.Releasing iOS 11.2 on a Friday night is a bit odd, but that might be because some iPhones keep rebooting themselves because of a time bug. After your device¡¯s clock passes 12:15 AM on December 2nd, 2017, apps with local notifications crash your phone (workout or meditation apps for instance). Apple may have rushed iOS 11.2 to fix this bug. You can probably expect a macOS, tvOS and watchOS update next week.So you should update your phone when you get a minute before you encounter this weird clock crash. Head over to the Settings app, then hit General, then Software Update."

The idea is similar to Twitch or YouTube¡¯s emotes, but instead of custom emoji, Periscope offers ¡°Super Hearts.¡± These are animated icons that fans can buy through in-app purchases to support their favorite streamers.Initially the program launched with three kinds of Super Hearts, but later added a waving hand icon as well.Last month, Twitter also bumped up the earnings potential from Super Hearts, by allowing broadcasters to keep more of money they made through Super Hearts sales.Before, Periscope said it would pay video creators 70 percent of the cash value of Super Hearts, after accounting for Apple and Google¡¯s 30 percent tax on in-app purchases. This changed in November, and now broadcasters can keep all their earnings, minus a $1 ¡°administration fee.¡± The new policy was meant to both attract new broadcasters as well as retain existing streamers who weren¡¯t happy with the earlier payouts system.Periscope hasn¡¯t yet shared figures related to how successful the program has been for streamers, nor how much money they¡¯ve collectively made. But it did announce today that community members have sent out 20 million Super Hearts to date.Broadcasters in the newly added countries can apply to join the program if they meet certain criteria around their minimum star balance, number of broadcasts, and average number of viewers, among other things.

After being made available in preview form for roughly a month, the app officially hits iOS and Android¡¯s respective app stores starting today. The followup to the once ubiquitous Internet Explorer has been blossoming on Windows 10 devices (most notably the Surface line, where it¡¯s learned some neat tricks) for a while now. The new mobile version of the app offers many of its familiar desktop/tablet features, including Favorites, Reading Lists and New Tab Pages.The company¡¯s also added a couple of pieces since making the browser available in preview form.

The addition of Edge is an important piece of Microsoft¡¯s new mobile strategy.

A pilot test in the Philippines gained 500,000 users who typically saved 30 percent of their data plan using the app.That makes particular sense in emerging markets like India, where the app is primarily focused, and Southeast Asia, where it was trialled, since most smartphone owners have prepaid SIM cards which take them offline when the credit is spent.Beyond helping cut out data-heavy apps when a user wants to focus on a different service or app,?Datally also provides an update on how much data each app is consuming ? Google calls this a ¡®speedometer for data¡¯ ? and it alerts users when they are near to a public WiFi point.That latter point ties into Google¡¯s free WiFi push which has seen it roll out free hotspots across India, including over 100 train stations, and expand the initiative into Southeast Asia, too.¡°There is, in my view, a Silicon Valley blind spot.

191,Apps,"Even YouTube is adding Stories. The popular format introduced by Snapchat, then adopted by Instagram, Skype, Facebook, Messenger and even some dating apps, is now making its way to YouTube as a new feature the company is calling ¡°Reels.¡± To be clear, Reels is YouTube¡¯s spin on Stories, not an exact copy. And Reels won¡¯t live at the top of the app, as Stories do on Instagram ? instead, they¡¯ll appear in a brand-new tab on a creator¡¯s channel.The launch of the Reels beta was mentioned briefly in an announcement today about the expansion of YouTube Community tab to all creators with over 10,000 subscribers.We asked YouTube for more details on Reels, which will soon be introduced into beta for a handful of creators for feedback and further testing.The company tells us the idea with Reels is to introduce a new video format on YouTube that lets creators express themselves and engage fans without having to post a full video.Instead, creators make new Reels by shooting a few quick mobile videos of up to 30 seconds each, then adding filters, music, text and more, including new ¡°YouTube-y¡± stickers.And unlike Stories on other platforms, YouTube creators can make multiple Reels and they won¡¯t expire.Below is what Reels will look like for creators at launch, but be aware that the format could change ahead of a public release.For video viewers, Reels may not mar the experience the way the addition of Stories did on Messenger or Facebook, where they weren¡¯t as welcome.Since Reels are posted to a separate tab on the creator¡¯s channel, similar to Community itself, viewers could choose to go watch these new videos or not.But if users engage with Reels, then YouTube will take that as a signal that you¡¯d like to see them more often. That could trigger their appearance on the viewer¡¯s YouTube home page as recommendations, YouTube tells us.The arrival of Reels is one of a handful of changes for YouTube and YouTube Community, the social platform?launched last fall as a new way for video creators to engage their fan base. A mini social network within YouTube¡¯s larger social network, Community lives on a creator¡¯s channel in its own tab, allowing them to share updates using text, photos, GIFs, polls, and more.The audience can then thumbs up or down the content, as they do videos, and comment on the posts.Also new to Community is a change to how posts work and are displayed to viewers. Now, a creator¡¯s most engaged viewers will see Community posts in their Home feed on YouTube, even if they¡¯re not subscribed to the channel.YouTube says notifications are also now optimized so fans aren¡¯t spammed with every new Community post.Community was initially launched into beta with only a handful of YouTube creators,?including?John & Hank Green,?AsapSCIENCE,?The Game Theorists,?Karmin,?The Key of Awesome,?The Kloons,?Lilly Singh,?Peter Hollens,?Rosianna Halse Rojas,?Sam Tsui,?Threadbanger, and?Vsauce3.Today, YouTube detailed how some of its testers have been using Community so far. For example,?Grav3yardgirl?used Community to ask fans to pick?what to unbox next;?Lele Pons?posted GIFs that serve as a trailers for her upcoming videos;?Kevin Durant?shares photos on NBA gameday. And some have used it send traffic to different channels, and other purposes.YouTube did not say when Reels will arrive in beta, how long until it¡¯s publicly available, or which creators will receive the format first."
192,Apps,"Facebook has always been about friends, but now it¡¯s seeking a broader purpose. So today, Facebook is lending a hand with what it does best: social connections, APIs, and money. At its second Facebook Social Good Forum conference in New York City, the social network just unveiled a slew of new philanthropy-minded features and initiatives.¡°For all the things that might try to pull people apart, if we can focus more on what brings our communities together, we can build common ground¡±, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said to kick off the event. ¡°We don¡¯t all agree on everything. One thing I¡¯ve found that people do agree on is the thing that what matters most to us in our lives is family and friends and our communities.¡±?Facebook is eliminating its 5% fee on donations so 100% of money sent through its Donate buttons go to the desired non-profit. Previously it took 5% to pay for credit card processing and verifying the 750,000 charities on its platform, but will now nobly eat that cost. However, personal fundraisers can still incur fees from 6.9% to 8.8%.It¡¯s setting up a $50 million per year Facebook Donations Fund to match giving on its app to causes like natural disaster relief. Facebook is expanding charitable giving tools to 13 countries in Europe plus Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.It¡¯s launching a Fundraiser API to sync Facebook fundraisers to offsite campaigns, starting with Susan G. Komen, JDRF, National Multiple Sclerosis Society and Movember, with plans to connect to 500 non-profits by end of Spring 2018. Its new Community Help API delivers data from Facebook¡¯s crisis volunteering feature to disaster response organizations to assist them with routing resources. After signing up 4 million blood donors in India, Facebook will expand the program to Bangladesh in 2018.Finally, it¡¯s launching a new Mentorship feature through partnered non-profits starting with iMentor for education and The International Rescue Committee for crisis recovery. People over 18 in need of addiction recovery, career advancement or other personal help will be matched with vetted mentors who will guide them through an on-Facebook curriculum of education materials.Together, the features could make Facebook a more popular way to donate money, and facilitate delivering support to everyone from disaster victims to at-risk youth.¡°Relationships are so important and on average an American has 3 or less people they can really depend on¡± says Naomi Gleit, Facebook¡¯s VP of social good and longest standing employee other than Mark Zuckerberg. She says that previously, she had to lobby Facebook for one-off funds whenever she though it should match donations around big crises. ¡°Now I have a more sustainable line item in the budget¡±.Facebook isn¡¯t quite clear how it¡¯s going to run some of these programs, but is committed to learning. Facebook will rely on the success metrics of its Mentorship feature partners to quantify its progress, for example. And Gleit didn¡¯t have answers to how Facebook would avoid bias in choosing which donations its new fund will match. ¡°We don¡¯t have the answers yet. it¡¯s still too early. We need to figure out the specifics over time¡± Gleit says, but for now Facebook¡¯s Donations Fund will match when the social network solicits donations on its crisis alert pages.¡°One of the things that strikes me so much is the deep sense of optimism that you all have¡± Zuckerberg said as his talked wound down. He explained how pessimism is self-fulfilling, while optimism leads people to try until they succeed.Zuckerberg discussed how from his year of travel around the U.S to ¡°get out of my bubble¡±, he learned that ¡°our relationships really shape our lives a lot more than I think we realize. If our relationships can help us set our sights just a little higher, we¡¯ll all be better for it.¡± That¡¯s why he asked his team what it could do, and they came up with this new mentorship feature.¡°Facebook has mostly focused on connecting us to people we already know¡± Zuckerberg explained. ¡°But I think it might be just as important to connect people to those outside of their network.¡± That¡¯s a major shift for Facebook. But also one that could open it to solving new problems and exploring new business opportunities.People in need are often surrounded by social graphs of others in need, so friends alone can¡¯t always help. But looking beyond, there could be plenty of people willing to serve as role models or who can teach mentees how they pulled themselves out of despair. Some of these mentors might not know their true worth until they see how good it feels to give.Facebook has spent the year embroiled in scandals around fake news, Russian election interference, and violence on Facebook Live. And increasingly, Facebook is being derided for addicting people to mindless feed scrolling. But it¡¯s clear that the company leadership wants Facebook¡¯s legacy to be more positive, and is willing to put its product teams, engineering prowess, and stunning profits to work in service of its mission.Additional reporting by Anthony Ha"
193,Apps,"Streaming services like Spotify have turned playlists into one of the main ways to discover new music, but I¡¯d argue that they¡¯re missing some of the personality of traditional radio ? the kind of radio where I knew not just the names of my favorite DJs, but also what kind of music they liked and random details about their life.That¡¯s the experience that Stationhead, a startup founded by musician Ryan Star and his childhood friend Jace Kay, is trying to bring to the streaming music world. The smartphone app allows anyone to turn their playlists into a personal radio station.While your station will continue playing automatically when you¡¯re not around, Star told me that the live experience is key. You¡¯re not just sharing a playlist but hosting a broadcast where you introduce the songs and talk about anything else that¡¯s on your mind. Listeners can ¡°bite¡± songs to add them to their own stations, and you can even call those listeners up to have live, on-air conversations.¡°Music is the social glue that gets them to talk,¡± Star said.Another crucial element of Stationhead¡¯s approach is the fact the startup doesn¡¯t have to make its own deals with the music labels. Instead, it integrates with existing streaming services ? it launched with Spotify and recently added Apple Music.Yes, that means you¡¯ll need a subscription to one of those services in order to listen, but it doesn¡¯t have to be the same one as the DJ ? if I¡¯m broadcasting from my Spotify account and you¡¯re listening on Apple Music, Stationhead works behind the scenes so that we¡¯re both listening to the same song without a hitch.¡°Because we¡¯re agnostic, we go cross platform, there¡¯s no barrier to be transmitting out to everybody now,¡± Star said.He acknowledged that there are rare cases where a song is available on one service but not the other. When that happens, Stationhead will just show you a ¡°Sad Bowie¡± error message until you get to the next song.For individual DJs, this could be a fun way to share the music you love, interact with friends and strangers ? and eventually, maybe even make some money.And for musicians, this could present an alternative way to get their music heard. While the old ¡°payola¡± system is illegal, Star argued that artists still need to spend an extraordinary amount of time and money in order to convince broadcasters to play their songs. In fact, Star said that one of the reasons he created Stationhead was because of the tremendous costs he was facing as an independent musician trying to get his music played.Stationhead is currently available on iOS. You can download the app here and use the code TECHCRUNCH to sign up. Star said he plans to add more social features and launch more broadly?early next year."
194,Apps,"By putting best friends first and dividing them from professional publishers, Snapchat hopes to conquer Instagram and revive its own growth with a big redesign that begins rolling out Friday. And it looks great. Snapchat is finally personalizing, highlighting the most relevant content?so it¡¯s easier to consume. ¡°We are separating the social from the media, and taking an important step forward towards strengthening our relationships with our friends and our relationships with the media,¡± Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel wrote in an Axios op-ed this morning. Rather than sorting content by how popular it is with everyone else like Facebook or by reverse chronological order like Snapchat used to, Snap will mold itself to what each person watches most, like Netflix.Even if Snapchat struggles to add more users amidst Facebook¡¯s competition, its new algorithms could get loyalists spending even more time and seeing more ads in the app. A small percentage of users worldwide on iOS and Android will start getting the new Snapchat on Friday, earlier than expected, and it should be rolled out to everyone within a few weeks.So what exactly is the redesign? It puts all messages and Stories from friends to the left of the camera, sorted by who you talk to and view most. It revives auto-advance, so you can watch everyone¡¯s Stories in a row, but with best friends, not people who post the most first. And it puts to the right of the camera all premium publishers, pro social media stars you follow and aggregated stories from search and Snap Map in the Discover section, curated by humans and sorted by your past viewing behavior.¡°Social media fueled ¡®fake news¡¯ because content designed to be shared by friends is not necessarily content designed to deliver accurate information,¡± writes Spiegel. Putting all Discover content through human editorial review could weed out the click-bait disinformation that¡¯s plagued Facebook.Snapchat will still show ads between Stories and Discover content like always. But because all the best content is shown in a row instead of being sorted chronologically or more uniformly for everyone, people will become less accustomed to skipping content, including its ads. That could be a boon for Snapchat, which fell $30 million short of revenue expectations last quarter, sinking its share price. Snap is down 2 percent today, potentially because the redesign mostly shuffles existing content rather than adding big new things, but Facebook is down 3.75 percent, perhaps because Snap is correcting some of its core flaws here and adopting Facebook¡¯s algorithmic approach.In reality, Snapchat needed this redesign a year ago when Facebook began its attack of the clones. But better late than never, and Snap¡¯s willingness to flip-flop on so many of its design and strategy choices is the courageous move it needed.Simple: The camera and profileSnapchat still opens to the camera, but now that screen has an icon to open every screen in the app, so it¡¯s more obvious how to navigate. Instead of burying Snap Map behind an awkward and unfamiliar pinch gesture, it opens alongside the Search bar. The profile will now be where you manage and check viewership of what you¡¯ve posted to Stories, public Our Stories and custom group Stories. This is the UI simplification Snapchat needed to appeal to less savvy adults without classmates to teach them how to use the app.Auto-advance with best first: The Friends pageSnap is mixing Stories and private messages in a single Friends tab. First you¡¯ll see new Snaps and text chats at the top, then Stories from your closest friends you watch and chat with the most, followed by the Stories from the rest of your acquaintances.Every group chat now gets its own Group Story all members can add to. Gone are social media influencers. Now if you follow someone but they don¡¯t follow you back they¡¯ll appear in Discover, whereas if they do follow you back, they¡¯ll be on the Friends page. Influencers will also get to choose if they want to share to just their friends or their followers too. The split should take pressure off your friends to perform like they¡¯re stars, encouraging people to post more raw and esoteric content instead of a perfectly polished presence.Back in April, we wrote that Snap was shooting itself in the foot by not algorithmically putting your best friends¡¯ Stories first like Instagram does, rather than highlighting the most recently posted Stories, which emphasized oversharers you might not care about. Now it¡¯s making that change.Importantly, Snapchat is bringing back Stories auto-advance, but with a twist. Snap used to automatically play the next Story in your list after your last, but Snap moved to a more cumbersome Story playlist in late 2016 where you had to manually pick what you wanted to watch. That and Instagram Stories are believed to have sapped view counts, leading many to think Snapchat had lost its mojo.Now, when you finish watching one Story, Snap will show a brief interstitial screen with the name and a preview of the next friend¡¯s Story. That way you can swipe down to exit out before you watch it (which friends can see in their analytics), or swipe over to skip to the next preview. This combined with the sorting makes it much easier to lean back and watch a ton of friends¡¯ Snaps. It¡¯s the most potent part of the whole redesign, and could seduce users who were losing their best friends¡¯ Stories amongst the noise.Publishers and creators: The new DiscoverSnapchat now lumps all professional creators, whether they¡¯re big news outlets or social media stars or video Show makers, into one Discover tab to the right of the camera. There also are aggregated Stories from hotspots on the Snap Map, Our Stories about events or holidays and topic-based aggregations from Snapchat Search. They¡¯re all shown as big preview tiles, with Discover publishers and creators you actively subscribe to at the top. Everything else is?sorted by what Snapchat thinks you want to see based on what you¡¯ve watched in the past.You¡¯ll actually be able to influence the algorithm with what¡¯s almost a reversal of Facebook¡¯s ¡°Like.¡± You can still tap and hold on Discover content to subscribe to the author, but you¡¯ll also get the option to ¡°see less¡± of this stuff. That way you can train the algorithm what to hide in the future.Snapchat¡¯s human editorial and moderation team will look at every piece of content it shows in Discover to make sure it¡¯s high-quality, brand-safe and not fake news. By limiting what¡¯s eligible for Discover and putting everything else in Friends, Snapchat can actually tackle the task of reviewing all its publisher content ? unlike Facebook, which is a Wild West of whatever¡¯s most engaging. That incentivized the fake news problem we see across the web, and Spiegel thinks tighter curation can solve the problem.For the first time, Snapchat will begin promoting social media stars to new audiences. If a creator has enough followers, and its content is approved by the human moderators, it can appear as a ¡°Popular Story¡± to users who don¡¯t already follow that creator. Starting in 2018, Snapchat says it will give independent social media stars ways to monetize their content, presumably by giving them a share of ad revenue they drive. Assisted audience growth and monetization could finally give creators a reason to invest time into Snapchat?because they actually get something back like from YouTube, but not Instagram.?You can watch Spiegel explain why Snap is splitting up friends and publishers in this video:The ball is now in Instagram¡¯s court. If it¡¯s smart, it will figure out its own premium content strategy. Right now, its Explore tab includes personalized and popular imagery plus hits from influencers. Meanwhile, Facebook¡¯s Watch Tab of original videos hasn¡¯t made many waves. With all its connections and reach, Instagram could recruit publishers and clone Snapchat¡¯s new Discover page like it did Stories.Teen Snap addicts might complain that the redesign is confusing,?jumbling all content from friends together. People always recoil to change. But it also makes Snapchat much simpler and more sensible for an adult audience, and lets you squeeze the most value out of the app even if you only open it a few times a day. At half its IPO pop price, Snapchat needs a savior, and may have found it in the algorithm."

I¡¯m not sure the team at Shopify¡¯s experimental Garage product development group knows this, but their latest app is basically made for me: It¡¯s a package tracking tool called Arrive that consolidates all your consumer shopping shipments in one place and makes it easy to get updates on your status, and deal with customer service if you need to.The Arrive app¡¯s basic premise might be familiar if you¡¯re already a fan of consolidating shipping info for your online purchases. I use Deliveries, for instance, the package tracking app by Junecloud that works with a companion desktop app for macOS and syncs your delivery status via iCloud. There are plenty of other options out there, too, for iOS and Android.Arrive offers some features it hopes will help it make your go-to when it comes to purchase tracking, including email account integration so that it can automatically add your shipments to its list of tracked items. It also provides rich notifications, which give you insight into your shipment¡¯s progress at every step of its journey so you basically don¡¯t even have to open the app to use it.You¡¯d be missing out if you never did open the app, however, since it¡¯s a beautiful looking product with a smart, intuitive and elegant design. Plus, Arrive automatically adds direct contact options for both the retailer and the shipper for your package, making it easy to get in touch in case you have any issues or want to set up a return.Arrive is retailer-agnostic, so it¡¯s not like it¡¯s limited to purchase you make at retailers using Shopify¡¯s commerce platform. And it has map-based location tracking, too for seeing where your stuff is when it¡¯s on its way to you.As of right now, Arrive is on iOS only, and also works with Gmail exclusively at launch. The team is working on broadening support to additional email providers in future, however."

This stuff is live only in USA and Canada for now, in specific cities.Finally, Waze now has the ability to listen for commands once its voice activation features are triggered by the wake words ¡°OK Waze,¡± which you can enable under the ¡®Sound & Voice¡¯ and ¡®Talk to Waze¡¯ section of the Waze app. Users in the US, UK and Canada will be able to take advantage of this capability.Waze chose to implement these products by selecting some of the most-requested features offered up by its community of engaged users, the company says, and they definitely do sound like they¡¯ll boost overall convenience for fans of Waze navigation."
197,Apps,"The team behind Pixelmator is releasing a brand new app today called Pixelmator Pro. As the name suggests, it is a more powerful, refreshed version of the company¡¯s original image-editing app. You can buy it today for $60 on the Mac App Store or try it for free.I¡¯ve been using the app for a couple of days, and it excels where the original Pixelmator used to excel. It is a fully native app that takes advantage of most of Apple¡¯s native APIs. While Adobe is still struggling to release Photoshop patches for macOS High Sierra, Pixelmator Pro is already using Apple¡¯s latest APIs.Pixelmator Pro has all the tools you¡¯d expect from an image processor, such as a smart selection tool, retouching tools, painting tools, all sorts of color adjustment effects and more.The app has been developed in Apple¡¯s own programming language Swift 4 and is optimized for your GPU thanks to Metal 2, Core Image and OpenGL. Photo editing is non-destructive, which means that you can open a photo again and revert to the original photo if you¡¯re not happy with your color adjustments ? you can also go back and revert individual changes without undoing all your work.If you want to edit multiple images with the same adjustments and effects, you can now save a preset and apply this preset to multiple images. You can also share presets with others by drag-and-dropping this preset into another app.Pixelmator Pro also leverages the Core ML framework for a couple of smart features. Just like Apple¡¯s Photos app, the app can now automatically detect the horizon to adjust your photo. More interestingly, the app tries to understand the content of your layers to automatically name your layers ? if you¡¯re adding a clock, Pixelmator Pro is going to name your layer ¡°clock¡±. I tried it with a few photos of objects on the web, and it worked as expected. It¡¯s not a life-changing feature, but it¡¯s nice.The app now supports more file formats, such as RAW files with multiple layers, HEIF photos and improved support for Photoshop images. It supports iCloud, tabs, sharing extensions, wide color and everything you¡¯d expect from a modern macOS app.The user interface is much cleaner than it used to be. Everything happens in a single, unified window. You can see your layers on the left and your tools on the right. If you hide those columns, Pixelmator Pro looks like a simple image viewer. As an existing Pixelmator user, it¡¯s harder to find what you¡¯re looking for. I hope it gets easier with time.Pixelmator 1.0 was originally released ten years ago. If you consider today¡¯s news as Pixelmator¡¯s first paid upgrade, the app has evolved quite a lot since 2007.So is it a Photoshop killer? I don¡¯t think Photoshop users are going to switch to Pixelmator Pro because Pixelmator Pro doesn¡¯t have all of Photoshop¡¯s features. It¡¯s hard to compete with a company that has thousands of employees.But it doesn¡¯t mean that Pixelmator Pro is useless. If you don¡¯t want to pay for a monthly subscription and aren¡¯t editing images for a living, Pixelmator Pro is a solid alternative. Many people could ditch Photoshop for Pixelmator Pro without having to look back."
198,Apps,"Instagram has tweaked a couple of its direct messaging features to make them a bit more flexible and interactive. You can now automatically capture and remix photos sent to you in replies back to friends, and allow photo and video replays to be replayed more than once.The remix feature lets you capture the original photo message and incorporate it into your reply, complete with the option to ¡°remix¡± it with added stickers, text and doodles. You can also resize the image and incorporate it into your own visual response ? meaning if you¡¯re truly dedicated you could create a never-ending chain of remixed responses that drives you totally insane from its incomprehensible unknowability.The other big change, and possibly one that¡¯s more impactful IMO, is that Instagram now lets you choose to allow replays on photo messages sent to friends, instead of having them expire permanently once viewed. That¡¯s a super cool feature, and a great option to have.The single view expiry was a bit of a holdover from similar features Instagram was emulating from Snapchat, but I think the option to replay is much more at home on the photo sharing social network. You still have the option to fade away after a one-time view, too, so people can be as ephemeral, or as semi-permanent as they want to be."
199,Apps,"Facebook may soon be ready to squeeze more money out of its 1.3 billion-user chat app. The company has internally developed ¡°Messenger Broadcast,¡± a self-serve mass-messaging interface that lets businesses send marketing messages to users. Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch that it¡¯s testing the feature internally, but hadn¡¯t trialed it to the public or with businesses as of late last month.While the company was cagey about the functionality, it appears that businesses design a welcome message, message title and subtitle, and include a call to action to the user such as visiting the business¡¯ website, prompting a Messenger bot or tapping to send a preset reply written by the business. Companies can preview their message within the Messenger Broadcast interface or on Messenger itself.As for who the message can reach, the interface outlines that a certain number of users will receive it at no cost to the business. It¡¯s unclear whether businesses will be able to pay for more reach, but that seems like a reasonable direction for the product.A Facebook spokesperson told me: ¡°We often test products, features and ideas and are always exploring new ways to make it easier for businesses to deliver great experiences to their customers. Once we¡¯ve tested them internally we make a call as to whether or not to ultimately release them. As such we don¡¯t comment on unreleased features.¡±Messenger Broadcast was first spotted by tipster phwd, which was reshared by The Next Web¡¯s Matt Navarra.Facebook has been cautious about monetizing Messenger, lest it hamper its growth. But over the past few years it¡¯s started offering Facebook News Feed ¡°click to message¡± ads that start conversations with businesses, allowing certain partners to send Sponsored Messages directly to users with the help of Facebook¡¯s ads team, and in July it began globally injecting display ads into the Messenger inbox.Facebook tells me that regardless of what happens with Messenger Broadcast, it has no plans to change the policy of requiring people to have initiated message threads with businesses before they can message the users with ads or otherwise. That means businesses may need to coax users into pinging them first before they can reach them through Messenger Broadcast. Though again, it¡¯s possible this never rolls out.Facebook will need to be careful here if it does launch the product. If Messenger feels spammy, users might not open chats from friends because they¡¯re lost amongst the ads, or flee back to the status quo of SMS.But with Messenger and Facebook¡¯s acquisition of WhatsApp now the dominant cross-platform messaging apps around the world beyond China, Facebook may finally feel?that Messenger is big and dominant enough to start earning its keep."
